The impact of these physical processes is reflected in the distribution and dynamics of the gas in star forming regions and understanding this impact is important for understanding both observations and simulations of star formation. In this talk, I present my thesis work investigating this connection by comparing 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of star-forming regions to analytic models of star formation. First, we investigate how the density probability distribution function (PDF) changes when including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and protostellar outflows. We find that self-gravity produces a power-law tail at high densities and the inclusion of stellar feedback from protostellar outflows produces time-varying deviations from a lognormal distribution at the low densities. We also explore how the gas dynamics varies with the inclusion of various physical processes and find that protostellar outflows and heating produce rapidly expanding and compressing gas at low densities. We further find that the net gas mass flux becomes constant at a higher density than the density at which the power-law portion of the PDF begins, but below the sink formation threshold. At this density, the net gas mass flux matches the mean star formation rate (SFR), suggesting that the gas dynamics at this density sets the overall SFR of the simulation., We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and without stellar feedback, magnetic fields, and driven turbulence, to study the compression and expansion rates of the gas as functions of density. We show that, around the mean density, supersonic turbulence promotes rough equilibrium between the amounts of compressing and expanding gas, consistent with continuous gas cycling between high- and low-density states. We find that the inclusion of protostellar jets produces rapidly expanding and compressing low-density gas. We find that the gas mass flux peaks at the transition between the lognormal and power-law forms of the density probability distribution function (PDF). This is consistent with the transition density tracking the post-shock density, which promotes an enhancement of mass at this density (i.e., shock compression and filament formation). At high densities, the gas dynamics are dominated by self-gravity: the compression rate in all of our runs matches the rate of the run with only gravity, suggesting that processes other than self-gravity have little effect at these densities. The net gas mass flux becomes constant at a density below the sink formation threshold, where it equals the star formation rate. The density at which the net gas mass flux equals the star formation rate is one order of magnitude lower than our sink threshold density, corresponds to the formation of the second power-law tail in the density PDF, and sets the overall star formation rates of these simulations., Since the beginning of 2012, the Borexino collaboration has been reporting precision measurements of the solar neutrino fluxes, emitted in the proton-proton chain and in the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen cycle. The experimental sensitivity achieved in Phase-II and Phase-III of the Borexino data taking made it possible to detect the annual modulation of the solar neutrino interaction rate due to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit, with a statistical significance greater than 5 σ. This is the first precise measurement of the Earth's orbital parameters based solely on solar neutrinos and an additional signature of the solar origin of the Borexino signal. The complete periodogram of the time series of the Borexino solar neutrino detection rate is also reported, exploring frequencies between one cycle/year and one cycle/day. No other significant modulation frequencies are found. The present results were uniquely made possible by Borexino's decade-long high-precision solar neutrino detection., We present an improved measurement of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) solar neutrino interaction rate at Earth obtained with the complete Borexino Phase-III dataset. The measured rate, R<SUB>CNO</SUB>=6.7<SUB>-0.8</SUB><SUP>+2.0</SUP> counts/(day ×100 tonnes ) , allows us to exclude the absence of the CNO signal with about 7 σ C.L. The correspondent CNO neutrino flux is 6.6<SUB>-0.9</SUB><SUP>+2.0</SUP>×10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> , taking into account the neutrino flavor conversion. We use the new CNO measurement to evaluate the C and N abundances in the Sun with respect to the H abundance for the first time with solar neutrinos. Our result of N<SUB>CN</SUB>=(5.7 8<SUB>-1.00</SUB><SUP>+1.86</SUP>)×10<SUP>-4</SUP> displays a ∼2 σ tension with the ""low-metallicity"" spectroscopic photospheric measurements. Furthermore, our result used together with the <SUP>7</SUP>Be and <SUP>8</SUP>B solar neutrino fluxes, also measured by Borexino, permits us to disfavor at 3.1 σ C.L. the ""low-metallicity"" standard solar model B16-AGSS09met as an alternative to the ""high-metallicity"" standard solar model B16-GS98., Using a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, we investigate how the density probability distribution function (PDF) changes when including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and protostellar outflows and heating. We find that the density PDF is not lognormal when outflows and self-gravity are considered. Self-gravity produces a power-law tail at high densities, and the inclusion of stellar feedback from protostellar outflows and heating produces significant time-varying deviations from a lognormal distribution at low densities. The simulation with outflows has an excess of diffuse gas compared to the simulations without outflows, exhibits an increased average sonic Mach number, and maintains a slower star formation rate (SFR) over the entire duration of the run. We study the mass transfer between the diffuse gas in the lognormal peak of the PDF, the collapsing gas in the power-law tail, and the stars. We find that the mass fraction in the power-law tail is constant, such that the stars form out of the power-law gas at the same rate at which the gas from the lognormal part replenishes the power law. We find that turbulence does not provide significant support in the dense gas associated with the power-law tail. When including outflows and magnetic fields in addition to driven turbulence, the rate of mass transfer from the lognormal to the power law, and then to the stars, becomes significantly slower, resulting in slower SFRs and longer depletion times., The search for neutrino events in correlation with 42 most intense fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been performed using the Borexino dataset from 05/2007 to 06/2021. We have searched for signals with visible energies above 250 keV within a time window of <inline-formula id=""IEq1""><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mspace width=""0.166667em""></mml:mspace><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> s corresponding to detection time of a particular FRB. We also applied an alternative approach based on searching for specific shapes of neutrino-electron scattering spectra in the full exposure data of the Borexino detector. In particular, two incoming neutrino spectra were considered: the monoenergetic line and the spectrum expected from supernovae. The same spectra were considered for electron antineutrinos detected through inverse beta-decay reaction. No statistically significant excess over the background was observed. As a result, the strongest upper limits on FRB-associated neutrino fluences of all flavors have been obtained in the 0.5–50 MeV neutrino energy range., Star formation informs our understanding of astrophysical processes at many different scales ranging from galaxy formation and evolution and the formation of stellar systems and exoplanets. Stars form in highly turbulent and magnetized molecular clouds. Recent work has shown that self-gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and stellar feedback are all critical to understanding the observed star formation efficiencies. The standard analytic approach has been to assume a lognormal density probability distribution function (PDF) and which accounts for self-gravity and stellar feedback only in an ad-hoc way. In our current work, we investigate a recently proposed model that uses a piecewise lognormal plus power law density PDF and which can account for self-gravity and stellar feedback. To test this model, we compare it to a suite of simulations which alternately include or do not include stellar feedback. We find that the simulation with stellar feedback has a more realistic star formation efficiency than the other simulations and is well described by a piecewise lognormal plus power law density PDF., Because of their dense stellar environments, globular clusters are an important place for investigating stellar evolution and stellar dynamics, but there is much yet to learn about their formation. In this project, we considered the globular cluster NGC 6681 (M70) with the goal of characterizing its stellar population. We used archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Surveys. The data was drawn from thirteen different filters ranging from the far-UV to the near infrared. Using this range of filters, we constructed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for each of the sources in our field of view. We then generated color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in a variety of wavelengths which we used to identify a number of sources that fell outside the regions occupied by normal stars. We determined the likely stellar type of several of these unusual sources using the CMDs and by comparing their SEDs to a number of synthesized SEDs., At redshifts of z &gt; 1.5, UV-selected galaxy populations (such as z ~ 3 Lyman break galaxies = LBGs) have the largest number of spectroscopic redshifts. As a result, LBGs have an important role in our understanding of the history of galaxy formation. However, LBGs are rather poorly understood at longer wavelengths, and thus our understanding of the total star formation rates and (especially) gas masses in such galaxies is incomplete. A common strategy is to assume that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas mass surface density holds, even in these high redshift galaxies where testing the relation directly is not feasible. To help assess the validity of this assumption, we examine the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in selected nearby (z ~ 0.2) starburst galaxies in the hope of better understanding key questions regarding star formation processes in UV-selected galaxies. Several nearby galaxies with high UV luminosities and surface brightnesses, reminiscent of those found in LBGs, were identified and used for this project. We have obtained new, spatially resolved observations of these nearby analogues in Paschen alpha emission and carbon monoxide emission, from the ESO Very Large Telescope and the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, respectively. We examine whether the galaxies follow the expected Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and investigate any implied variation in gas depletion times between and within galaxies.

(github.com/sblunt/orbitize) that has been hacked and customized for fitting betelgeuse astrometry., Orbit-fitting for directly imaged objects, orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020)., Between 2018 November 16 and 2020 February 6, we obtained 36 RVs using the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope (R~60000 at 500-620nm). <P />(1 data file)., Giant exoplanets have been directly imaged over orders of magnitude of orbital separations, prompting theoretical and observational investigations of their formation pathways. In this paper, we present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometric data of HIP 65426 b, a cold, giant exoplanet which is a particular challenge for most formation theories at a projected separation of 92 au from its primary. Leveraging GRAVITY's astrometric precision, we present an updated eccentricity posterior that disfavors large eccentricities. The eccentricity posterior is still prior dependent, and we extensively interpret and discuss the limits of the posterior constraints presented here. We also perform updated spectral comparisons with self-consistent forward-modeled spectra, finding a best-fit ExoREM model with solar metallicity and C/O = 0.6. An important caveat is that it is difficult to estimate robust errors on these values, which are subject to interpolation errors as well as potentially missing model physics. Taken together, the orbital and atmospheric constraints paint a preliminary picture of formation inconsistent with scattering after disk dispersal. Further work is needed to validate this interpretation. Analysis code used to perform this work is available on GitHub: https://github.com/sblunt/hip65426., No description provided., Mass, radius, and age measurements of young (≲100 Myr) planets have the power to shape our understanding of planet formation. However, young stars tend to be extremely variable in both photometry and radial velocity (RV) measurements, which makes constraining these properties challenging. The V1298 Tau system of four ~0.5 R <SUB>J</SUB> planets transiting a pre-main-sequence star presents an important, if stress-inducing, opportunity to observe and measure directly the properties of infant planets. Suárez Mascareño et al. published radial-velocity-derived masses for two of the V1298 Tau planets using a state-of-the-art Gaussian process regression framework. The planetary densities computed from these masses were surprisingly high, implying extremely rapid contraction after formation in tension with most existing planet-formation theories. In an effort to constrain further the masses of the V1298 Tau planets, we obtained 36 RVs using Keck/HIRES, and analyzed them in concert with published RVs and photometry. Through performing a suite of cross-validation tests, we found evidence that the preferred model of Suárez Mascareño et al. suffers from overfitting, defined as the inability to predict unseen data, rendering the masses unreliable. We detail several potential causes of this overfitting, many of which may be important for other RV analyses of other active stars, and recommend that additional time and resources be allocated to understanding and mitigating activity in active young stars such as V1298 Tau., Orbit-fitting for directly imaged objects, Giant exoplanets are easiest to detect, and therefore most amenable to detailed study, both individually and at the population level. Despite this, big questions still remain about their formation: Do all giant planets form the same way? How efficient is the formation process? How does formation condition change as a function of companion mass, planet multiplicity, etc? For my thesis, I worked to understand the orbits of giant planets in order to constrain these formation processes. <P />Many of my thesis projects focused on eccentricity as a probe of dynamical history. In this talk, I'll present the population-level eccentricity distributions of giant planets and brown dwarfs (Bowler, Blunt+ 2020; Nagpal, Blunt+ in press), and the major implication that directly-imaged giant planets and brown dwarfs form differently. I'll then present objects that appear to buck this trend: HR 5183 b (Blunt+ 2019), an old high-eccentricity object, and HIP 65426 b (Blunt+ in prep), a young moderate-eccentricity object, which may be outcomes of post-formation planet-planet interactions. <P />A second major component of my thesis involved understanding stellar activity in order to extract planetary orbit signals. For young giant planets, dynamical masses directly constrain post-formation entropy, the major tunable parameter in formation models. For the highly active 20 Myr star V1298 Tau, with four transiting planets, detailed characterization of the activity is crucial for reliable planet masses. I'll present evidence that previously detected RV signals of V1298 Tau (Suárez-Mascareño+ 2022) are affected by Gaussian Process overfitting, and provide updated masses (Blunt+ submitted). <P />I'll wrap up by presenting my contributions to open-source software tools that support the exoplanet community: orbitize! (Blunt+ 2017; Blunt+ 2020; Ferrer-Chávez, Wang, Blunt 2020; Covarrubias, Blunt+ 2021), RadVel (Fulton, Petigura, Blunt+ 2018), and the Keck Planet Finder Data Reduction Pipeline., In this thesis, I have translated a few flavors of exoplanet timeseries measurements into constraints on exoplanet orbital parameters, and used these to make inferences about planet formation. I begin by introducing the two main observational techniques I used to perform these analyses: optical interferometry and stellar radial velocity monitoring. I then discuss some of the big open questions of exoplanet formation, particularly the mechanism for forming giant planets close to and far from their stars, where core accretion is thought to be too inefficient to form giant planet cores in time for them to accrete atmospheres.High cadence radial velocity monitoring enables advances in our understanding of stellar activity, the fundamental stumbling block in the path to discovering and characterizing planets like the Earth. In my second thesis chapter, I present an argument that previously published RV-derived activity models of the PMS star V1298 Tau suffer from overfitting, casting doubt on published mass estimates of the young planets in the system which necessitated rapid contraction after formation, in tension with formation theory. I walk through several potential explanations for this overfitting, pointing out that the star has a strong differential rotation signal which is not included in published model fits, and encourage broader use of cross validation techniques in stellar activity model evaluation.Optical interferometry, particularly using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, enables astrometry measurements that are orders of magnitude more precise than contemporary coronographic instruments, which translates to precise orbital parameters. In my third thesis chapter, I present and analyze two new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometric measurements of a young, widely separated planet and use them to make a preliminary argument that the planet's eccentricity is low or moderate. This sets an upper limit on the time (relative to disk dispersal) that the planet attained its current wide separation, and downweights the possibility of scattering after disk dispersal.In the next two chapters, I showcase my contributions to two widely used opensource orbit-fitting software toolkits: orbitize! and radvel. I highlight two major new features of orbitize! that are available in the main code base as of the release of version 2: jointly fitting radial velocity measurements and jointly fitting absolute astrometry measurements. In the radvel chapter, I motivate and describe an updated Gaussian Process regression model for stellar activity modeling that reduces the potential for overfitting., orbitize! is an open-source, object-oriented software package for fitting the orbits of directly imaged objects. It packages the Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI) algorithm and a parallel-tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm into a consistent and intuitive Python API. orbitize! makes it easy to run standard astrometric orbit fits; in less than 10 lines of code, users can read in data, perform one fit using OFTI and another using MCMC, and make two publication-ready figures. Extensive pedagogical tutorials, intended to be navigable by both orbit-fitting novices and seasoned experts, are available on our documentation page. We have designed the orbitize! API to be flexible and easy to use/modify for unique cases. orbitize! was designed by members of the exoplanet imaging community to be a central repository for algorithms, techniques, and know-how developed by this community. We intend for it to continue to expand and change as the field progresses and new techniques are developed, and call for community involvement in this process. Complete and up-to-date documentation is available at orbitize.info, and the source code is available at github.com/sblunt/orbitize., Add a keyword for plotting orbits that cross PA=360 Default corner plot now displays angles in degrees instead of radians, Doppler monitoring of HR 5183 began in 1997 at Keck/HIRES and in 1999 at McDonald/Tull. HR 5183 was also monitored on the Automated Planet Finder (APF) with high cadence since its commissioning in 2013. The APF is an automated 2.4 meter telescope at Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California. <P />Between 1997 and 2019, 78 high-resolution (R=60000) spectra of HR 5183 with the HIRES spectrograph (Vogt et al. 1994SPIE.2198..362V; Cumming et al. 2008PASP..120..531C; Howard et al. 2010, J/other/Sci/330.653) were obtained. Between 1999 and 2019, 175 high-resolution (R=60000) spectra with the Tull Coude Spectrograph (Tull et al. 1995PASP..107..251T) on the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith telescope were collected, as part of the McDonald Observatory planet search (Cochran et al. 1997ApJ...483..457C; Hatzes et al. 2000ApJ...544L.145H). Finally, between 2013 and 2019, 104 spectra of HR 5183 with the APF (Radovan et al. 2014SPIE.9145E..2BR; Vogt et al. 2014PASP..126..359V) were obtained. <P />(1 data file)., Based on two decades of radial velocity (RV) observations using Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and McDonald/Tull, and more recent observations using the Automated Planet Finder, we found that the nearby star HR 5183 (HD 120066) hosts a 3 {M}<SUB>{{J</SUB>}} minimum mass planet with an orbital period of {74}<SUB>-22</SUB><SUP>+43</SUP> yr. The orbit is highly eccentric (e ≃ 0.84), shuttling the planet from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune. Our careful survey design enabled high cadence observations before, during, and after the planet’s periastron passage, yielding precise orbital parameter constraints. We searched for stellar or planetary companions that could have excited the planet’s eccentricity, but found no candidates, potentially implying that the perturber was ejected from the system. We did identify a bound stellar companion more than 15,000 au from the primary, but reasoned that it is currently too widely separated to have an appreciable effect on HR 5183 b. Because HR 5183 b’s wide orbit takes it more than 30 au (1″) from its star, we also explored the potential of complimentary studies with direct imaging or stellar astrometry. We found that a Gaia detection is very likely, and that imaging at 10 μm is a promising avenue. This discovery highlights the value of long-baseline RV surveys for discovering and characterizing long-period, eccentric Jovian planets. This population may offer important insights into the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing multiple massive planets., This is the version that will be described in our paper., orbitize fits the orbits of directly-imaged objects by packaging the Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI) algorithm and a parallel-tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm into a consistent API. It accepts observations in three measurement formats, which can be mixed in the same input file, generates orbits, and plots the computed orbital parameters. orbitize offers numerous ways to visualize the data, including histograms, corner plots, and orbit plots. Generated orbits can be saved in HDF5 format for future use and analysis., We announce the discovery of the longest-period planet with a well-constrained orbit discovered with radial velocities (RVs). HR 5183 b, with P = 75 ± 30 yr, e = 0.84 ± 0.04, and M sin i = 3.23 ± 0.14 M<SUB>J</SUB>, was detected independently in more than two decades of data from Keck/HIRES and McDonald/Tull. The highly eccentric orbit takes the planet from within the orbit of Jupiter to beyond the orbit of Neptune over one period. Because of this high eccentricity, orbital information density is strongly peaked around periastron, which occurred in January 2018. By observing this periastron passage event with high cadence, we were able to place tight constraints on the orbital parameters without witnessing an entire orbital period. <P />In terms of semimajor axis and mass, HR 5183 b is most similar to a typical directly imaged planet, but its advanced age, extreme eccentricity, and solar-type primary star differentiate it from this population. This discovery probes a previously unexplored population of exoplanets, highlighting the value of long-baseline RV surveys and raising interesting questions about the long-term evolution of planetary systems with massive planets., Orbit-fitting for directly imaged objects, Add sep/PA panels to orbit plot. GaussianPrior now operates on only positive numbers by default., We present the discovery of HD 120066 b, a giant planet with eccentricity 0.84±0.04, minimum mass 3.14±0.14 MJ, and orbital period 66+31-17 years. This is the longest-period exoplanet discovered with radial velocity (RV) measurements. At periastron, HD 120066 b is closer to its star than our solar system's asteroid belt is to the Sun, and at apastron, it is farther than Neptune. We combined RV data from Keck/HIRES, McDonald Observatory/Tull, and the Automated Planet Finder (APF) to detect the 80 m/s signal from pericenter passage induced by HD 120066 b over the last 20 years. We explored the parameter space of orbits consistent with these data, and from these fits inferred that the planet passed through periastron in January 2018. HD 120066 is an excellent target for coronagraphic imaging with the WFIRST coronagraph, and an ideal testbed for theories of eccentric giant planet formation., Initial release!, Gaussian process regression is a promising technique to account for the presence of correlated noise in radial velocity (RV) time series. We present version 2 of RadVel, an open-source RV fitting toolkit that can model the effects of stellar variability using Gaussian process regression. To illustrate the features of our code and the power of Gaussian process regression, we present a re-analysis of the HD 3167 system (Vanderberg et al. 2016, Christiansen et al. 2017, Gandolfi et al. 2017), using a quasi-periodic kernel to model the stellar activity. We combine RV datasets from HARPS, HARPS-N, FIES, APF, and HIRES in our analysis, yielding a total of 366 RV measurements. Our fit indicates that the magnitude of the RV variation due to stellar activity has an amplitude comparable to those of the planetary signals, confirming that a detailed activity model is needed for this system. We obtain a planet b mass consistent with that of Christiansen et al, but a significantly higher planet c mass and a lower mass for planet d., We describe a Bayesian rejection-sampling algorithm designed to efficiently compute posterior distributions of orbital elements for data covering short fractions of long-period exoplanet orbits. Our implementation of this method, Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude faster than two implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in this regime. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors for all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster than a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC implementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot noise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months of astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to 10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3% of their orbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the literature., Direct imaging planet-finders like the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) allow for direct imaging of exoplanets with orbital periods beyond ~10 years that are still close enough to their host stars to undergo detectable orbital motion on year or multi-year timescales, creating a need for methods that rapidly characterize newly discovered planets using relative astrometry covering a short fraction of an orbital period. We address this problem with Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), a statistically robust and computationally efficient Bayesian rejection sampling method for fitting orbits to astrometric datasets covering small orbital fractions from directly imaged exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and wide-orbit stellar binaries. We demonstrate that OFTI produces valid orbital solutions by directly comparing its outputs with those of two Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementations, and compare the computational speeds of OFTI and MCMC as a function of orbital fraction spanned by input astrometry. We find that for well-sampled orbits with astrometry covering less than 15% of the total orbital period, OFTI converges on the correct orbital solution in orders of magnitude less CPU time than MCMC. Exoplanet observations with space missions such as the WFIRST coronagraph present a similar problem of sparse sampling, and we show how these methods can efficiently constrain the orbital inclination, phase, and separation of a planet such as 47 Uma c. Finally, we present some of the first orbital fits to astrometry from directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs in the literature, including GJ 504 b, CD-35 2722 B, kappa And b, and HR 3549 B., Next generation planet-finders like the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) allow for direct imaging of exoplanets that are close enough to their host stars to undergo detectable orbital motion on monthly timescales, creating a need for methods that rapidly characterize newly discovered planets using short astrometric baselines. We present a computationally efficient Monte Carlo method that fits randomly generated orbital parameters to astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets from a fraction of an orbit. This code quickly and efficiently produces distributions of plausible orbital parameters, while a traditional Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm would take much longer to converge given the same inputs (future work will directly compare the computational efficiencies and outputs of both algorithms).This technique allows us to predict the future motion of a planet by randomly generating plausible orbits that fit just a few epochs of astrometry, or even a single epoch. We first applied this method to predicting the future position of 51 Eri b, a giant exoplanet discovered by GPIES, using astrometry with only a 1-month baseline. Subsequent observations of 51 Eri b after seven months found the planet at the peak of the probability distributions predicting future motion. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to GPIES and the future WFIRST-AFTA space mission, from distinguishing bound planets from background objects to constraining orbital parameters given data from only a few observational epochs after discovery.This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation REU Program under Grant No. AST-1359346., We investigate the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of the contrasts of four types of solar surface features observed in the G-Band (430.6 nm, FWHM 1.2 nm) by analyzing 12 high quality full-disk images obtained from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. The studied features, specifically network, enhanced network, plage, and bright plage, were singled out based on their brightness signatures in mean simultaneous Ca II K images using an intensity threshold technique. We compared our results with those obtained from high-resolution (HR) observations, and with the outputs of the spectral synthesis performed on semi-empirical models and magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find that the measured contrasts are systematically lower than those of HR observational results, as was expected due to the lower resolution of the analyzed observations. We also find that our observations best reflect the CLV derived from the recent one-dimensional atmospheric models described in Fontenla et al 2011 with respect to results obtained from earlier similar models. The measured CLV also agrees with those derived from the syntheses of MHD simulations and HR observations, if spatial resolution effects are properly taken into account.

Their X-ray emission, varying with orbital phase, originates from synchrotron radiation produced by high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. For fast-spinning pulsars in compact binary systems, the intrabinary shock emission occurs in the fast cooling regime. Using global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effect of synchrotron losses on the shock structure and the resulting emission, assuming that the pulsar wind is stronger than the companion wind (so, the shock wraps around the companion), as expected in black widows. We find that the shock opening angle gets narrower for greater losses; the lightcurve shows a more prominent double-peaked signature (with two peaks just before and after the pulsar eclipse) for stronger cooling; below the cooling frequency, the synchrotron spectrum displays a hard power-law range, consistent with X-ray observations., Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. Their X-ray emission - modulated on the orbital period - is interpreted as synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. We perform global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the intrabinary shock, assuming that the shock wraps around the companion star. When the pulsar spin axis is nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we find that the magnetic energy of the relativistic pulsar wind - composed of magnetic stripes of alternating field polarity - efficiently converts to particle energy at the intrabinary shock, via shock-driven reconnection. The highest energy particles accelerated by reconnection can stream ahead of the shock and be further accelerated by the upstream motional electric field. In the downstream, further energization is governed by stochastic interactions with the plasmoids/magnetic islands generated by reconnection. We also extend our earlier work by performing simulations that have a larger (and more realistic) companion size and a more strongly magnetized pulsar wind. We confirm that our first-principles synchrotron spectra and light curves are in good agreement with X-ray observations., Relativistic collisionless shocks are efficient sites of particle acceleration, producing broad nonthermal spectra with power-law distributions. One such example is expected from compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low mass companion, colloquially known as ""Spider"" pulsars. The relativistic and strongly magnetized pulsar wind impacts onto the companion, ablating it and slowly consuming its atmosphere. This interaction gives rise to the formation of an intrabinary shock, a proposed site of particle acceleration and nonthermal emission. Using TRISTAN-MP we perform global, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction of a striped pulsar wind with a companion star. We present an analysis of the different mechanisms responsible for accelerating particles, focusing on the interplay between magnetic reconnection and the first- and second-order Fermi processes. Our first-principles synchrotron spectra and lightcurves show good agreement with X-ray observations if the system's orbital angular momentum is nearly aligned with the pulsar spin axis., Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. The relativistic magnetically dominated pulsar wind impacts onto the companion, ablating it and slowly consuming its atmosphere. The interaction forms an intrabinary shock, a proposed site of particle acceleration. We perform global fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of the intrabinary shock, assuming that the pulsar wind consists of plane-parallel stripes of alternating polarity and that the shock wraps around the companion. We find that particles are efficiently accelerated via shock-driven reconnection. We extract first-principles synchrotron spectra and light curves, which are in good agreement with X-ray observations: (1) the synchrotron spectrum is nearly flat, F <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ const; (2) when the pulsar spin axis is nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum, the light curve displays two peaks, just before and after the pulsar eclipse (pulsar superior conjunction), separated in phase by ~0.8 rad; (3) the peak flux exceeds the one at the inferior conjunction by a factor of 10., Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low mass companion. The relativistic and strongly magnetized pulsar wind impacts onto the companion, ablating it and slowly consuming its atmosphere. This interaction gives rise to the formation of an intrabinary shock, a proposed site of nonthermal emission and particle acceleration. We perform global fully-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction of a striped pulsar wind with the companion star. We present first-principles synchrotron spectra and light curves, which closely match the observations if the orbital angular momentum is nearly aligned with the pulsar spin axis., Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low mass companion.

We present first-principles synchrotron spectra and light curves, which closely match the observations if the orbital angular momentum of the system is nearly aligned with the pulsar spin axis., White dwarfs are one of the few types of stellar object for which we have yet to confirm the existence of companion planets. Recent evidence for metal contaminated atmospheres, circumstellar debris discs, and transiting planetary debris all indicates that planets may be likely. However, white dwarf transit surveys are challenging due to the intrinsic faintness of such objects, the short time-scale of the transits, and the low transit probabilities due to their compact radii. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) offers a remedy to these problems as a deep, half-sky survey with fast exposures encompassing approximately 10 million white dwarfs with r &lt; 24.5 apparent magnitude (m<SUB>r</SUB>). We simulate LSST photometric observations of 3.5 million white dwarfs over a 10 yr period and calculate the detectability of companion planets with P &lt; 10 d via transits. We find typical detection rates in the range of 5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> to 4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> for Ceres-sized bodies to Earth-sized worlds, yielding ∼50-4000 detections for a 100 per cent occurrence rate of each. For terrestrial planets in the continuously habitable zone, we find detection rates of ∼10<SUP>-3</SUP> indicating that LSST would reveal hundreds of such worlds for occurrence rates in the range of 1-10 per cent., Over the last four years more than 2,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered, motivating us to search for and characterize potentially habitable worlds. Most planets orbit Sun-like stars, but more exotic stars can also host planets. Debris disks and disintegrating planetary bodies have been detected around white dwarf stars, the inert, Earth-sized cores of once-thriving stars like our Sun. These detections are clues that planets may exist around white dwarfs. Due to the faintness of white dwarfs and the potential rarity of planets around them, a vast survey is required to have a chance at detecting these planetary systems. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), scheduled to commence operations in 2023, will image the entire southern sky every few nights for 10 years, providing our first real opportunity to detect planets around white dwarfs. We characterized LSST’s ability to detect planets around white dwarfs through simulations that incorporate realistic models for LSST’s observing strategy and the white dwarf distribution within the Milky Way galaxy. This was done through the use of LSST's Operations Simulator (OpSim) and Catalog Simulator (CatSim). Our preliminary results indicate that, if all white dwarfs were to possess a planet, LSST would yield a detection for every 100 observed white dwarfs. In the future, a larger set of ongoing simulations will help us quantify the number of planets LSST could potentially find., In this paper, we study the consistency of having Lorentz invariance as a low energy approximation within the quantum field theory framework. A model with a scalar and a fermion field is used to show how a Lorentz invariance violating high momentum scale, a physical cutoff rendering the quantum field theory finite, can be made compatible with a suppression of Lorentz invariance violations at low momenta. The fine tuning required to get this suppression and to have a light scalar particle in the spectrum are determined at one loop., We characterize here the main minerals forming two lunar achondrites (NWA 2700 and Dhofar 1085) whose properties are being extensively studied as a final degree project of first author. Both are different lunar achondrites, the first being a complex breccia and the second one is an anorthositic rock mainly formed by fayalite (Fe2SiO4) and ferrosilite (FeSiO3). Our goal is obtaining information on the physicochemical processes that participated in the formation of both stones., We present here a precise UV to NIR reflectance spectra of NWA 2700. We wish to explore the relation between the mineralogy, the size of the grains, and the reflectance. Interesting links between lunar soil mineralogy and reflectance are found., Geochemistry of basalts provides important information about the ascent of magmas from source to surface, indirectly shedding light on the hidden volcanic plumbing system. In addition, based on whole-rock elemental and isotopic geochemistry of spatially and temporally related monogenetic volcanoes, we show that geochemistry is a powerful fingerprinting tool, and an important aid in unravelling the complex stratigraphy of basalt fields. The studied units, which we have informally named OPB (older, phenocryst-bearing unit) and YMB (younger, megacryst- and phenocryst-bearing unit) are compared with the Marcath (Black Rock) volcano. These units are defined and/or described in a separate abstract. Petrographically, samples are porphyritic basalts with phenocrysts and/or xenocrysts of olivine, ortho- and clino-pyroxene, amphibole and plagioclase, sometimes up to 4-5 cm in length, set in a groundmass containing plagioclase and pyroxene microlites. On a Total Alkalies vs. Silica diagram, samples from all of the centers are trachybasalts, basanites, and basalts with SiO<SUB>2</SUB> varying from 42 to 48 wt. %, the more primitive of which erupted from Marcath volcano. Subtle but clear trace element differences are observed, although all of the samples have OIB-type signatures. Samples from the OPB unit are slightly depleted in most incompatible trace elements relative to YMB and Marcath, which have typical OIB signatures, although depleted in Zr. The subtle difference between OPB and YMB/Marcath is clearly observed in La/Yb, which ranges between 11-16 for OPB and 17-21 for YMB/Marcath. Another useful discriminant is Nb/Zr, which ranges between 0.18-0.24 and 0.26-0.30 for OPB and YMB/Marcath, respectively. These differences are also reflected in the isotopic systematics, in which <SUP>87</SUP>Sr/<SUP>86</SUP>Sr ranges from 0.7031-0.7034 in OPB and 0.7035-0.7036 in YMB/Marcath. These small but significant compositional differences help in verifying field-based stratigraphic relationships and may reflect heterogeneities in the asthenospheric mantle and/or complex differences in magma-lithosphere interaction during the evolution of the LCVF. The presence or absence of megacrysts and their identification as either phenocrysts or xenocrysts is key to understanding volcanic plumbing systems, and discerning whether magma rose from directly from source to surface or stalled in shallow crustal chambers., Using the available NRAO's site characterization data, we study the observing conditions (PWV and Phase Stability) at Llano de Chajnantor during the ``Altiplanic Winter'' and their impact on ALMA scientific operations. The results suggest that during this period ALMA observations will be limited to lower frequency bands and compact array configurations. In terms of only the PWV, observations are possible until Band 6 (~230 GHz) the 70% of the time. Phase stability conditions suggest that atmospheric phase correction is strictly necessary during this period, allowing us to observe in the compact configurations at Band 3 (~100 GHz) about 55% of the time., In this paper the implications of a recently proposed phenomenological model of cosmology, the Asymptotic Cosmological Model (ACM), on the behavior of scalar perturbations are studied. Firstly we discuss new fits of the ACM at the homogeneous level, including fits to the Type Ia Supernovae UNION dataset, first CMB peak of WMAP5 and BAOs. The linearized equations of scalar perturbations in the FRW metric are derived. A simple model is used to compute the CMB temperature perturbation spectrum. The results are compared with the treatment of perturbations in other approaches to the problem of the accelerated expansion of the universe., The possibility of having an extension of the cosmological standard model with a Hubble expansion rate H constrained to a finite interval is considered. Two periods of accelerated expansion arise naturally when the Hubble expansion rate approaches to the two limiting values. The new description of the history of the universe is confronted with cosmological data and with several theoretical ideas going beyond the standard cosmological model., We present CO(J=3→2) emission observations toward the Fornax Cluster interacting-galaxy pair NGC 1326A-B using the Atacama Sub-millimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE), and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) as part of an ongoing survey of Fornax interacting galaxies. These results show that NGC 1326A displays 17 mK emission for the inner 2 kpc. NGC 1326B displays a strong emission of 0.2 K along its disk with a secondary component of 60 mK at an intermediate velocity between NGC 1326A and NGC 1326B, suggesting the idea that gas, which originally belonged to NGC 1326A, is falling onto NGC 1326B. The observed kinematics in NGC 1326B shows no apparent gas rotation, which might suggest that the observed gas component has been recently disturbed, and is also consistent with a recent collision between the galaxies. The strong CO(J=3→2) emission detected suggests ongoing active star formation, and shows the feasibility of using CO(J=3→2) to study warm gas in this kind of interacting system., We present the results of the stellar and ionized gas kinematics of 13 bright peculiar Virgo cluster galaxies. The stellar velocity field are mostly consistent with a rotation pattern, but some of them shows interesting features such as; Sshaped stellar isovelocity contours in NGC 4064, and signatures of kinematical distinct components in NGC 4429, and NGC 4698., We present the results of the stellar and ionized gas kinematics of 13 bright peculiar Virgo cluster galaxies. The stellar velocity fields are mostly consistent with a rotation pattern, but some of them shows interesting features such as; S-shaped stellar isovelocity contours in NGC 4064, and signatures of kinematical distinct components in NGC 4429, and NGC 4698. This latter galaxy and NGC 4424 exhibit extremely low (V/σ)* values suggesting that these galaxies are the result of mergers. The ionized gas velocity fields are more disturbed than the stellar velocity fields, displaying non-circular motions. Most galaxies in the sample reveals kinematical signatures that can be associated to gravitational interactions such as; mergers or tidal interactions, being specially clear in the ``truncated/compact'' galaxies. Moreover, most of the sample galaxies show evidence for both gravitational interactions, and ICM-ISM stripping. Thus the evolution of a significant fraction of cluster galaxies is likely strongly impacted by both effects., A discussion of the modification of the phase-space commutators in a quantum mechanical relativistic theory with an invariant length scale (DSR) is presented. Two examples are discussed where a classical behavior is approached in one case when the energy approaches the inverse of the invariant length which appears as a cutoff in the energy and in the second case when the mass is much larger than the inverse of the invariant length.","['10.48550/arXiv.2501.08387', 'arXiv:2501.08387', '2025arXiv250108387C', '2024MNRAS.tmp.2223C', '10.1093/mnras/stae2278', '10.48550/arXiv.2404.03700', 'arXiv:2404.03700', '2024MNRAS.534.2551C', '2024arXiv240403700C', '2023HEAD...2011656C', 'arXiv:2203.00023', '2022arXiv220300023C', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac74b2', '10.48550/arXiv.2203.00023', '2022ApJ...933..140C', '2022HEAD...1911016C', '2022APS..DPPPO6006C', '10.48550/arXiv.1810.00776', 'arXiv:1810.00776', '2019MNRAS.tmp.1853C', '10.1093/mnras/stz1300', '2018arXiv181000776C', '2019MNRAS.tmp.1228C', '2019MNRAS.488.1695C', '2018AAS...23124619C', '2017IJMPA..3250084C', '2016arXiv160700744C', '10.1142/S0217751X17500841', '10.48550/arXiv.1607.00744', 'arXiv:1607.00744', '2012epsc.conf...26C', '2012espc.conf...26C', '2012LPI....43.1455C', '2011AGUFM.V33C2663C', '2011RMxAC..41...63C', '10.48550/arXiv.0908.1354', 'arXiv:0908.1354', '2009arXiv0908.1354C', '10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.10.002', '2010APh....32..330C', '2009APh....31..177C', 'arXiv:0805.3481', '2008arXiv0805.3481C', '10.1016/j.astropartphys.2008.12.009', '10.48550/arXiv.0805.3481', '2008ASPC..395..365C', '2007ggnu.conf..343C', '10.1007/978-3-540-71173-5_57', '2006RMxAC..26Q.189C', '10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0602627', 'arXiv:astro-ph/0602627', '2006astro.ph..2627C', '2005PhRvD..71f5015C', '10.1103/PhysRevD.71.065015', '10.48550/arXiv.hep-th/0405285', '2004hep.th....5285C', 'arXiv:hep-th/0405285']","[('pulsar', 32), ('companion', 20), ('shock', 19), ('particle', 16), ('ngc', 15), ('system', 14), ('planet', 13), ('wind', 12), ('interaction', 12), ('white', 12)]","[(('white', 'dwarf'), 12), (('pulsar', 'wind'), 11), (('intrabinary', 'shock'), 10), (('binary', 'system'), 7), (('synchrotron', 'spectrum'), 7), (('spider', 'pulsar'), 6), (('system', 'composed'), 6), (('composed', 'millisecond'), 6), (('millisecond', 'pulsar'), 6), (('pulsar', 'low'), 6)]","[(('binary', 'systems', 'composed'), 6), (('systems', 'composed', 'millisecond'), 6), (('composed', 'millisecond', 'pulsar'), 6), (('millisecond', 'pulsar', 'low'), 6), (('pulsar', 'low', 'mass'), 6), (('low', 'mass', 'companion'), 6), (('compact', 'binary', 'systems'), 6), (('particle', 'cell', 'simulations'), 6), (('pulsars', 'compact', 'binary'), 5), (('pulsar', 'spin', 'axis'), 5)]",Dirty

Recently, Harrington &amp; Garaud used three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) to show that a vertical magnetic field can dramatically enhance the rate of chemical mixing by fingering convection. Furthermore, they proposed a so-called ""parasitic saturation"" theory to model this process. Here, we test their model over a broad range of parameter space, using a suite of DNS of magnetized fingering convection, varying the magnetic Prandtl number, magnetic field strength, and composition gradient. We find that the rate of chemical mixing measured in the simulations is not always predicted accurately by their existing model, in particular when the magnetic diffusivity is large. We then present an extension of the Harrington &amp; Garaud model which resolves this issue. When applied to stellar parameters, it recovers the results of Harrington &amp; Garaud except in the limit where fingering convection becomes marginally stable, where the new model is preferred. We discuss the implications of our findings for stellar structure and evolution., Observations show an almost ubiquitous presence of extra mixing in low-mass upper giant branch stars. The most commonly invoked explanation for this is thermohaline mixing. One-dimensional stellar evolution models include various prescriptions for thermohaline mixing, but the use of observational data directly to discriminate between thermohaline prescriptions has thus far been limited. Here, we propose a new framework to facilitate direct comparison: using carbon-to-nitrogen measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV APOGEE survey as a probe of mixing and a fluid parameter known as the reduced density ratio from one-dimensional stellar evolution programs, we compare the observed amount of extra mixing on the upper giant branch to predicted trends from three-dimensional fluid dynamics simulations. Using this method, we are able to empirically constrain how mixing efficiency should vary with the reduced density ratio. We find the observed amount of extra mixing is strongly correlated with the reduced density ratio and that trends between reduced density ratio and fundamental stellar parameters are robust across choices for modeling prescription. We show that stars with available mixing data tend to have relatively low density ratios, which should inform the regimes selected for future simulation efforts. Finally, we show that there is increased mixing at low reduced density ratios, which is consistent with current hydrodynamical models of thermohaline mixing. The introduction of this framework sets a new standard for theoretical modeling efforts, as validation for not only the amount of extra mixing, but trends between the degree of extra mixing and fundamental stellar parameters is now possible., We investigate the linear stability of a sinusoidal shear flow with an initially uniform streamwise magnetic field in the framework of incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with finite resistivity and viscosity. This flow is known to be unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the hydrodynamic case. The same is true in ideal MHD, where dissipation is neglected, provided the magnetic field strength does not exceed a critical threshold beyond which magnetic tension stabilizes the flow. Here, we demonstrate that including viscosity and resistivity introduces two new modes of instability. One of these modes, which we refer to as an Alfvénic Dubrulle-Frisch instability, exists for any non-zero magnetic field strength as long as the magnetic Prandtl number ${{{Pm}}} &lt; 1$ . We present a reduced model for this instability that reveals its excitation mechanism to be the negative eddy viscosity of periodic shear flows described by Dubrulle &amp; Frisch (Phys. Rev. A, vol. 43, 1991, pp. 5355-5364). Finally, we demonstrate numerically that this mode saturates in a quasi-stationary state dominated by counter-propagating solitons., The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of a shear layer with an initially-uniform magnetic field in the direction of flow is studied in the framework of 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamics with finite resistivity and viscosity using direct numerical simulations. The shear layer evolves freely, with no external forcing, and thus broadens in time as turbulent stresses transport momentum across it. As with KH-unstable flows in hydrodynamics, the instability here features a conjugate stable mode for every unstable mode in the absence of dissipation. Stable modes are shown to transport momentum up its gradient, shrinking the layer width whenever they exceed unstable modes in amplitude. In simulations with weak magnetic fields, the linear instability is minimally affected by the magnetic field, but enhanced small-scale fluctuations relative to the hydrodynamic case are observed. These enhanced fluctuations coincide with increased energy dissipation and faster layer broadening, with these features more pronounced in simulations with stronger fields. These trends result from the magnetic field reducing the effects of stable modes relative to the transfer of energy to small scales. As field strength increases, stable modes become less excited and thus transport less momentum against its gradient. Furthermore, the energy that would otherwise transfer back to the driving shear due to stable modes is instead allowed to cascade to small scales, where it is lost to dissipation. Approximations of the turbulent state in terms of a reduced set of modes are explored. While the Reynolds stress is well-described using just two modes per wavenumber at large scales, the Maxwell stress is not., Fingering convection is an important source of mixing in stars, which are low Prandtl number fluids. Quantifying transport by fingering convection is therefore crucial to a better understanding of stellar evolution. In the absence of magnetic fields, Brown et al. have shown that fingering-induced fluxes measured in DNS are well-predicted by a so-called ''parasitic'' model, in which the primary fingering instability is assumed to saturate due to the growth of secondary shear instabilities between the fingers. Recent work extended this analysis to include a vertical magnetic field, and found that a similar parasitic model could account for the increase in turbulent fluxes with magnetic field strength observed in simulations. However, this analysis was limited to a small region of parameter space. Here we show that lowering the magnetic Prandtl number and exploring a broader range of stratifications reveals discrepancies between the parasitic saturation model and the DNS results. We propose some explanations, and discuss implications of our findings for other systems where parasitic saturation models are used, such as the MRI in accretion disks and GSF instability in stars. <P />This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF AST 1908338)., Shear flows are common and important in astrophysical plasmas, where they often serve as free energy sources able to drive fluctuations and turbulence. In turn, these motions enhance momentum, energy, and particle transport, thus crucially affecting the evolution of the system. The parameter boundaries delineating shear-driven fluctuations are often assumed to be provided by normal-mode linear stability analyses. However, in many important systems, including pipe flow and stratified shear flows in neutral fluids, such analyses are known to be misleading. Perturbations can grow significantly through nonmodal or non-normal growth, potentially driving turbulence and mixing even at parameters where linear stability analyses predict no growth. Here, we explore the degree of nonmodal growth when equilibrium magnetic fields aligned with the flow nearly or entirely stabilize shear-flow instabilities. Pseudospectra indicate significant nonmodal amplification in linearly stable regimes for 2D systems. We also present progress towards comparisons of 2D and 3D optimal linear perturbations that maximize fluctuation growth., A linearly unstable, sinusoidal E × B shear flow is examined in the gyrokinetic framework in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, it is shown that the eigenmode spectrum is nearly identical to hydrodynamic shear flows, with a conjugate stable mode found at every unstable wavenumber. In the nonlinear regime, turbulent saturation of the instability is examined with and without the inclusion of a driving term that prevents nonlinear flattening of the mean flow and a scale-independent radiative damping term that suppresses the excitation of conjugate stable modes. From a variety of analyses, the nonlinear state is found to have a significant component associated with stable modes. The role of these modes is investigated through a simple fluid model that tracks how momentum transport and partial flattening of the mean flow scale with the driving term. From this model, it is shown that, except at high radiative damping, stable modes play an important role in the turbulent state and yield significantly improved quantitative predictions when compared with corresponding models neglecting stable modes., The influence of soil organisms on metal mobility and bioavailability in soils is not currently fully understood. We conducted experiments to determine whether calcium carbonate granules secreted by the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris could incorporate and immobilise lead in lead- and calcium-amended artificial soils. Soil lead concentrations were up to 2000 mg kg <SUP>-1</SUP> and lead:calcium ratios by mass were 0.5-8. Average granule production rates of 0.39 ± 0.04 mg <SUB>calcite</SUB> earthworm <SUP>-1</SUP> day <SUP>-1</SUP> did not vary with soil lead concentration. The lead:calcium ratio in granules increased significantly with that of the soil ( r<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.81, p = 0.015) with lead concentrations in granules reaching 1577 mg kg <SUP>-1</SUP>. X-ray diffraction detected calcite and aragonite in the granules with indications that lead was incorporated into the calcite at the surface of the granules. In addition to the presence of calcite and aragonite X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that lead was present in the granules mainly as complexes sorbed to the surface but with traces of lead-bearing calcite and cerussite. The impact that lead-incorporation into earthworm calcite granules has on lead mobility at lead-contaminated sites will depend on the fraction of total soil lead that would be otherwise mobile.","['2023arXiv230211610F', 'arXiv:2302.11610', '2024ApJ...964..184F', '10.48550/arXiv.2302.11610', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fe', '2022arXiv220408487F', 'arXiv:2204.08487', '2022ApJ...941..164F', '10.48550/arXiv.2204.08487', '10.3847/1538-4357/aca024', '2022arXiv220410875F', '10.1017/jfm.2022.782', '10.48550/arXiv.2204.10875', '2022JFM...949A..43F', 'arXiv:2204.10875', '10.1063/5.0034575', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.11198', '2020arXiv201011198F', 'arXiv:2010.11198', '2021PhPl...28b2309F', '2021APS..DFDT11004F', '2021APS..DPPTP1022F', '2018arXiv180709280F', 'arXiv:1807.09280', '10.48550/arXiv.1807.09280', '2018PhPl...25l2303F', '10.1063/1.5049580', '10.1016/j.gca.2011.02.015', '2011GeCoA..75.2544F']","[('mode', 19), ('magnetic', 18), ('mixing', 16), ('field', 15), ('model', 15), ('flow', 15), ('lead', 14), ('stable', 12), ('shear', 12), ('instability', 12)]","[(('magnetic', 'field'), 13), (('stable', 'mode'), 10), (('shear', 'flow'), 7), (('fingering', 'convection'), 6), (('density', 'ratio'), 6), (('field', 'strength'), 5), (('extra', 'mixing'), 5), (('reduced', 'density'), 5), (('prandtl', 'number'), 4), (('soil', 'lead'), 4)]","[(('magnetic', 'field', 'strength'), 4), (('reduced', 'density', 'ratio'), 4), (('harrington', 'amp', 'garaud'), 3), (('magnetic', 'prandtl', 'number'), 3), (('amount', 'extra', 'mixing'), 3), (('direct', 'numerical', 'simulations'), 2), (('vertical', 'magnetic', 'field'), 2), (('rate', 'chemical', 'mixing'), 2), (('discuss', 'implications', 'findings'), 2), (('upper', 'giant', 'branch'), 2)]",Dirty

WINTER's science goals include robotic follow-up of kilonovae from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star black-hole (NSBH) mergers, surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, along with building up a deep, coadded image of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) detectors for cost-effective near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs detectors as a first run of a newly-designed 1920 x 1080 pixel read out integrated circuit (ROIC). It uses a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt; 1 degree-squared field of view in Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9-1.7μm). The survey currently operates with a median limiting magnitude of J<SUB>AB</SUB> ≈ 18.5, running nightly robotic surveys and target of opportunity programs. In parallel to these science programs, there is ongoing work to improve WINTER's performance, which shows a factor of ∼ 10 decreased instrument efficiency from the design. Laboratory and on-sky testing suggest the sensor's InGaAs diode array is performing properly, but sensitivity is being lost during amplification in the ROIC's pixel amplifier. We present the laboratory and on-sky performance newly-commissioned WINTER observatory along with ongoing and future efforts to improve performance., The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory in June of 2023.

WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs detectors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 degree-squared field of view in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9-1.7 microns). In this talk, I will present the design, performance, and early on-sky results from the newly-commissioned WINTER observatory., The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new time-domain instrument which will perform a seeing-limited survey of the near-infrared sky. In this talk, I will present the design and science goals of the WINTER instrument, which will be deployed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. Among the many near-infrared targets of interest, WINTER is principally designed for follow-up of kilonovae from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers detected in gravitational waves and is predicted to discover up to five kilonovae during the upcoming gravitational-wave detector run. In addition to kilonova follow-up, WINTER will conduct a wide range of time-domain surveys to a depth of J=21 magnitudes, building up a deep co-added image of the near-infrared sky and studying near-infrared transients including supernovae, tidal disruption events, and transiting exoplanets around low mass stars. WINTER's custom camera combines six commercial large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors, observing in Y, J, and a short-H (Hs) band filters (0.9-1.7 microns), and employs a novel tiled optical design to cover a &gt;1 degree squared field of view with 90% fill factor. I will conclude with updates on the final integration of the WINTER instrument and commissioning at Palomar Observatory., The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> seeing-limited time-domain survey instrument designed for dedicated near-infrared follow-up of kilonovae from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole mergers. WINTER will observe in the near-infrared Y, J, and short-H bands (0.9-1.7 μm, to J <SUB> AB </SUB> = 21 mag) on a dedicated 1 m telescope at Palomar Observatory. To date, most prompt kilonova follow-up has been in optical wavelengths; however, near-infrared emission fades more slowly and depends less on geometry and viewing angle than optical emission. We present an end-to-end simulation of a follow-up campaign during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers, including simulating 625 BNS mergers, their detection in gravitational waves, low-latency and full parameter estimation skymaps, and a suite of kilonova lightcurves from two different model grids. We predict up to five new kilonovae independently discovered by WINTER during O4, given a realistic BNS merger rate. Using a larger grid of kilonova parameters, we find that kilonova emission is ≈2 times longer lived and red kilonovae are detected ≈1.5 times further in the infrared than in the optical. For 90% localization areas smaller than 150 (450) deg<SUP>2</SUP>, WINTER will be sensitive to more than 10% of the kilonova model grid out to 350 (200) Mpc. We develop a generalized toolkit to create an optimal BNS follow-up strategy with any electromagnetic telescope and present WINTER's observing strategy with this framework. This toolkit, all simulated gravitational-wave events, and skymaps are made available for use by the community., The Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph (LLAMAS) is an Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph under construction as a facility instrument for the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes. For each pointing, LLAMAS delivers 2400 optical spectra (λ =350-970nm) over a 37""x37"" celestial solid angle with a resolution of 2000 through a densely packed microlens+fiber array and replicated low-cost spectrographs. One of our main science goals is to study circumgalactic gas through Lyα emission. To achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio for these observations, LLAMAS must minimize stray light reaching the detector: diffuse scattered light must stay below 0.25% of sky flux and ghost images must not exceed 0.1% of the source signal. We present a non-sequential ray tracing analysis of a simplified LLAMAS model using Photon Engineering's FRED Optical Engineering Software. We focus on stray light resulting from the volume phase holographic grating and from focal ratio degradation of the fibers. The analysis feeds into a discussion of the design and fabrication of baffles to mask the primary sources of stray light. Additionally, we develop a backup system of mounting rings inside of the cameras where pre-made baffles can be quickly added as needed. Finally, we report on the laboratory performance of a 2-camera LLAMAS prototype featuring the aforementioned stray light interventions., The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a 1x1 degree infrared survey telescope under devel- opment at MIT and Caltech, and slated for commissioning at Palomar Observatory in 2021. WINTER is a seeing-limited infrared time-domain survey and has two main science goals: (1) the discovery of IR kilonovae and r-process materials from binary neutron star mergers and (2) the study of general IR transients, including supernovae, tidal disruption events, and transiting exoplanets around low mass stars. We plan to meet these science goals with technologies that are relatively new to astrophysical research: hybridized InGaAs sensors as an alternative to traditional, but expensive, HgCdTe arrays and an IR-optimized 1-meter COTS telescope. To mitigate risk, optimize development efforts, and ensure that WINTER meets its science objectives, we use model-based systems engineering (MBSE) techniques commonly featured in aerospace engineering projects. Even as ground-based instrumentation projects grow in complexity, they do not often have the budget for a full-time systems engineer. We present one example of systems engineering for the ground-based WINTER project, featuring software tools that allow students or staff to learn the fundamentals of MBSE and capture the results in a formalized software interface. We focus on the top-level science requirements with a detailed example of how the goal of detecting kilonovae flows down to WINTER's optical design. In particular, we discuss new methods for tolerance simulations, eliminating stray light, and maximizing image quality of a fly's-eye design that slices the telescope's focus onto 6 non-buttable, IR detectors. We also include a discussion of safety constraints for a robotic telescope., The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will be the world’s largest telescope upon completion. The GMT employs seven 8 m primary mirror segments and seven 1 m secondary mirror segments. One challenge of the GMT is keeping the seven pairs of mirror segments on the GMT in phase. In this project, we developed and began assembly on a design for a dispersed fringe sensor prototype consisting of an optical and basic mechanical layout. The prototype design will be tested on the Magellan Clay Telescope as an experiment for future phasing methods to be used on the GMT., The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will employ seven 8.4m primary mirror segments and seven 1m secondary mirror segments to achieve the diffraction limit of a 25.4m aperture. One challenge of the GMT is keeping the seven pairs of mirror segments in phase. We present a conceptual opto mechanical design for a prototype dispersed fringe sensor. The prototype, which operates at J-band and incorporates an infrared avalanche photodiode array, will be deployed on the Magellan Clay Telescope to verify the sensitivity and accuracy of the planned GMT phasing sensor.","['10.1117/12.3019165', '2024SPIE13096E..3JF', '2024AAS...24334601F', '2023AAS...24145108F', '10.48550/arXiv.2110.01622', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac4508', 'arXiv:2110.01622', '2021arXiv211001622F', '2022ApJ...926..152F', '2020SPIE11447E..6EF', '10.1117/12.2562999', '10.48550/arXiv.2105.01219', '10.1117/12.2562842', '2021arXiv210501219F', '2020SPIE11447E..67F', 'arXiv:2105.01219', '2018AAS...23115211F', '2017AAS...22915520F']","[('winter', 25), ('infrared', 22), ('telescope', 15), ('design', 12), ('survey', 11), ('star', 11), ('optical', 10), ('field', 9), ('transient', 9), ('time', 9)]","[(('neutron', 'star'), 9), (('infrared', 'transient'), 6), (('time', 'domain'), 6), (('palomar', 'observatory'), 6), (('science', 'goal'), 6), (('mirror', 'segment'), 6), (('wide', 'field'), 5), (('field', 'infrared'), 5), (('transient', 'explorer'), 5), (('explorer', 'winter'), 5)]","[(('wide', 'field', 'infrared'), 5), (('field', 'infrared', 'transient'), 5), (('infrared', 'transient', 'explorer'), 5), (('transient', 'explorer', 'winter'), 5), (('binary', 'neutron', 'star'), 5), (('time', 'domain', 'survey'), 4), (('telescope', 'palomar', 'observatory'), 4), (('follow', 'kilonovae', 'binary'), 4), (('kilonovae', 'binary', 'neutron'), 4), (('neutron', 'star', 'black'), 4)]",Dirty

TolTEC achieved first light on the 50-meter Large Millimeter Telescope in July 2022, just prior to a planned summer telescope maintenance shutdown, and began commissioning observations when the telescope resumed observations in December 2022. The commissioning program consisted of observations of targeted nebulae, molecular clouds, polarized quasars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. The goals of these observations include demonstrating the science capabilities of the camera and characterizing the performance and instrumental properties, including noise, beams, and polarization sensitivity in its three bands centered at 1.1, 1.4, and 2.0 mm |with angular resolutions of 5, 6, and 10 arcseconds, respectively. We present early results from the commissioning observations of the Crab Nebula. Upcoming observations will include selected proposals from the broader astronomy community in Mexico and the United States, as well as legacy surveys focused on mapping galactic molecular clouds, cold dust emission in local galaxies, polarized dust emission in filaments around star-forming regions, massive galaxy clusters, and distant obscured star-forming galaxies., We present the design, fabrication, and measured performance of metamaterial antireflection cuttings (ARCs) for large-format alumina filters operating over more than an octave of bandwidth to be deployed at the Simons Observatory (SO). The ARC consists of subwavelength features diced into the optic's surface using a custom dicing saw with near-micrometer accuracy. The designs achieve percent-level control over reflections at angles of incidence up to 20 ∘ . The ARCs were demonstrated on four 42 cm diameter filters covering the 75 to 170 GHz band and a 50 mm diameter prototype covering the 200 to 300 GHz band. The reflection and transmission of these samples were measured using a broadband coherent source that covers frequencies from 20 GHz to 1.2 THz. These measurements demonstrate percent-level control over reflectance across the targeted pass-bands and a rapid reduction in transmission as the wavelength approaches the length scale of the metamaterial structure where scattering dominates the optical response. The latter behavior enables use of the metamaterial ARC as a scattering filter in this limit., The Simons Observatory will be a cosmic microwave background survey experiment with three small-aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope, which will observe from the Atacama Desert in Chile. In total, SO will field over 60,000 transition-edge sensor bolometers in six spectral bands in order to achieve the sensitivity necessary to measure or constrain numerous cosmological quantities, as outlined in The Simons Observatory Collaboration et al. (2019). This instrument requires large numbers of highly transparent, large aperture, refracting optics. To this end, we developed mechanically robust, highly efficient, metamaterial anti-reflection coatings with octave bandwidth coverage for silicon optics up to 46 cm in diameter for the 22-55, 75-165, and 190-310 GHz bands. We detail the design, the manufacturing approach to fabricate the 50 lenses needed for SO, their performance, and possible extensions of metamaterial AR coatings to optical elements made of harder materials such as alumina.","['10.1051/epjconf/202429300022', '2024EPJWC.29300022G', '10.1364/AO.472459', '2022ApOpt..61.8904G', '2022arXiv220802292G', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.02292', 'arXiv:2208.02292', '10.1117/12.2561720', '2020SPIE11451E..5TG', 'arXiv:2101.10298', '2021arXiv210110298G', '10.48550/arXiv.2101.10298']","[('band', 7), ('observation', 6), ('large', 5), ('telescope', 5), ('galaxy', 5), ('metamaterial', 5), ('arc', 4), ('ghz', 4), ('sensitivity', 3), ('commissioning', 3)]","[(('simon', 'observatory'), 3), (('ghz', 'band'), 3), (('commissioning', 'observation'), 2), (('molecular', 'cloud'), 2), (('galaxy', 'cluster'), 2), (('observation', 'include'), 2), (('dust', 'emission'), 2), (('star', 'forming'), 2), (('octave', 'bandwidth'), 2), (('percent', 'level'), 2)]","[(('percent', 'level', 'control'), 2), (('covering', 'ghz', 'band'), 2), (('toltec', 'polarization', 'sensitive'), 1), (('polarization', 'sensitive', 'camera'), 1), (('sensitive', 'camera', 'millimeter'), 1), (('camera', 'millimeter', 'wavelengths'), 1), (('millimeter', 'wavelengths', 'unprecedented'), 1), (('wavelengths', 'unprecedented', 'sensitivity'), 1), (('unprecedented', 'sensitivity', 'arcsecond'), 1), (('sensitivity', 'arcsecond', 'resolution'), 1)]",Dirty

Our analytical model predicts that the spiral density modulation results from space-dependent drift velocities of the ionized electrons due to the spatial and temporal intensity distributions of the circularly polarized ionizing laser. The spiral topology of the electron density has been validated by three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Simulations further show that the spiral density modulation subsequently self-organizes to form numerous microfilaments, i.e., thin strands that arise because of a modified streaming instability., The giant spiral galaxy M101 is host to the nearest recent Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) and thus has been extensively monitored in the near-infrared to study the late-time light curve of the SN. Leveraging this existing baseline of observations, we derive the first Mira-based distance to M101 by discovering and classifying a sample of 211 Miras with periods ranging from 240–400 days in the SN field. Combined with new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR channel observations, our data set totals 11 epochs of F110W (HST YJ) and 13 epochs of F160W (HST H) data spanning ∼2900 days. We adopt absolute calibrations of the Mira period–luminosity relation based on geometric distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the water megamaser host galaxy NGC 4258, and find μ <SUB>M101</SUB> = 29.10 ± 0.06 mag. This distance is in 1σ agreement with most other recent Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distance measurements to M101. Including the previous Mira SN Ia host, NGC 1559, and SN 2005df, we determine the fiducial SN Ia peak luminosity, ${M}_{B}^{0}=-19.27\,\pm \,0.09$ mag. With the Hubble diagram of supernovae Ia, we derive H <SUB>0</SUB> = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>‑1</SUP>, a 4.1% measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB> using Miras. We find excellent agreement with recent Cepheid distance ladder measurements of H <SUB>0</SUB> and confirm previous indications that the local universe value of H <SUB>0</SUB> is higher than the early universe value at ∼95% confidence. Currently, the Mira-based H <SUB>0</SUB> measurement is still dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the SN Ia peak magnitude., Here we provide a review of Mira variables, their basic properties, and Period-Luminosity Relations with an emphasis on their role in measuring the Hubble Constant. The usage of multiple independent distance indicators and methods is crucial to cross-checking systematic uncertainties in distance measurements and in reinforcing previous findings of the Hubble tension. To this end, Mira variables serve as an alternative Type Ia Supernova calibrator to the more commonly-used Cepheid variables or Tip of the Red Giant Branch method. They also have the potential to expand the number of local SN Ia calibrators by calibrating previously-inaccessible SNe Ia. Short-period ($P \lesssim 400$ d) O-rich Miras are a ubiquitous older population that can reach galaxies not hosting the younger Cepheids variables or out of reach to the old but fainter Tip of the Red Giant Branch. With the current and upcoming focus on infrared observations, Miras, which can be discovered and characterized using exclusively near-infrared and infrared observations, will be particularly useful in obtaining distances to astrophysical objects. Long-period Miras ($P \gtrsim 400$ d) are highly luminous variables that have the potential to measure $H_0$ directly, excluding Type Ia SNe altogether in the distance ladder., We have analyzed ionospheric measurements of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites during an intense magnetic storm and identified the following phenomena. Strong penetration electric fields cause large vertical ion drifts over the magnetic equator, subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) penetrate to the equatorial latitudes and cause large westward ion drifts, the topside ion density at middle latitudes is enhanced by an order of magnitude for 12 hours or longer, and the electron temperature at subauroral latitudes is enhanced by 1,000-4,000 K over a few days. This study provides new insight into the characteristics and spatial-temporal evolution of ionospheric space weather processes., A positive correlation between the frequency of type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the associated hard power-law flux has been discovered in a few black hole binaries. The correlation is explained quantitatively based on the Alfven wave oscillation model. The QPO is assumed to be generated by the Alfven wave oscillation in the standard thin Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) at radius with the maximum radiation flux. The power-law flux is calculated based on inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from SSD by a medium of hot electrons in the corona or the base of jet. Both the explicit solutions and numerical results of the correlation between the QPO frequency and the power-law flux with the changing accretion rate are obtained. The modelled correlation fits well into the observed one within reasonable parameter range. The positive correlation could be interpreted by the hypothesis that a stronger magnetic field leads to a higher Alfven wave frequency and a higher electron temperature and therefore a stronger power-law flux. The results suggest that type-B QPOs may be related to the toroidal magnetic activities in the accretion disk or the jet., The recent tension between direct, model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant and the model-dependent values inferred from observations of the CMB has posed the strongest challenge to LambdaCDM in nearly 30 years. However, the burden of proof for a potentially groundbreaking discovery of new physics is high. Thus, alternative routes to the present measurements of the Hubble constant -- which rely primarily on Cepheids and Tip of Red Giant Branch as intermediate distance indicators -- must be explored in order to verify the current results and to fully understand the role of systematic uncertainties. Oxygen-rich Mira variables are luminous, ubiquitous, NIR and IR standard candles and present a particularly compelling path forward to studying the tension in the era of JWST. Here, we propose to use the high angular resolution and infrared coverage of NIRCam to simultaneously refine the Mira-based distance ladder and re-examine Cepheid crowding in the Type Ia Supernova host galaxy M101. This will allow us to verify the Cepheid results by using an independent ladder subject to different systematics, and by directly reanalyzing the Cepheids in M101. In this joint proposal consisting of one epoch of JWST NIRCam and three epochs of coordinated HST WFC3/IR and ACS observations, we will (1) de-blend the backgrounds of known Cepheids and Miras in M101, (2) improve Mira spectral type classification, and (3) study the effect of dust and mass loss on the Mira PLR. The three HST epochs will allow us to phase the single-epoch JWST observations to mean magnitude and produce Mira PLR in JWST bands for the first time., The recent tension between direct, model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant and the model-dependent values inferred from observations of the CMB has posed the strongest challenge to LambdaCDM in nearly 30 years.

As one of the nearest symbiotic binary stars, R Aquarii (D ~ 220 pc) offers a unique opportunity to study the inner region within ~600 au of the jet source, which is particularly crucial to our understanding of nonrelativistic jet formation and origin. We present high-angular resolution UV and optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope in six emission-line regions of the inner jet. Using these observations to obtain a range of representative line ratios for our system and kinematic data derived from a comparison with previous studies, we model the shocked gas in order to determine the relative roles of shock heating and photoionization in the R Aquarii system. We find that our shock models suggest that a nonzero magnetic field is needed to describe the measured line ratios. We also find that the Mg II λλ2795,2802 intensities are overpredicted by our models for most of the jet regions, perhaps because of depletion onto grains or to opacity in these resonance lines., As the brightest and one of the nearest of all red supergiants, Betelgeuse has been studied for well over a century, which makes the unprecedented ""Great Dimming"" it experienced in late 2019 and early 2020 even more intriguing. One of only a handful of stars with a resolvable surface, Betelgeuse provides a unique window into understanding stellar atmospheres. Recent ultraviolet and optical spectra of the star show weakening and new asymmetries in key spectral lines while the dimming occurred. I will discuss our work using the non-LTE, numerical radiative transfer code RH and semi-empirical models of Betelgeuse's atmosphere to understand what may have caused the changes in its spectra before, after, and during the Great Dimming., Electron-induced chemistry is relevant to many processes that occur when an ionizing source interacts with matter, as in the formation of complex molecules within frozen condensates in space. We explore in this paper the radiolysis and the desorption processes affecting iced mixtures of water and carbon monoxide subjected to electron irradiation in the sub-keV regime. The experiments have been performed with the Interstellar Energetic Process System (IEPS), an ultra-high vacuum chamber equipped with an electron gun. The irradiated ices have been monitored with infrared and mass spectroscopies. We derive the chemistry and determine cross-sections for relevant processes as functions of the energy of the impacting electrons. We quantify the electron-stimulated desorption of some significant species in terms of their desorption yields, and relate these quantities to the electron penetration depth and the desorption-relevant length. The results of this study have been compared with the outcomes of similar experiments performed using pure carbon monoxide ices., This study uses 10 epochs of HST WFC3/IR F160W data (GO-15145; PI Riess), with an exposure time of 1006s for each epoch. The epochs have an approximately monthly cadence between 2017 September 8 and 2018 September 11, with a field of view centered at RAJ2000=04:17:37 and DEJ2000=-62:47:00. <P />To put our observations on the same zero-point as H18 (Huang+, 2018, J/ApJ/857/67), which we adopt for an absolute calibration of distance, we use the same HST WFC3 IR photometric zero-point for a 0.4""-radius aperture. In Vega magnitudes, the F160W zero-point is 24.5037mag. See Section 2.2. <P />(1 data file)., The discrepancy between local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) and the value inferred from observations of the CMB may be our strongest indication of physics beyond a Lambda-CDM cosmological model. Direct, distance-ladder measurements of the H0 rely primarily on Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) to calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). Here we propose an independent approach using Mira variables. Miras can check existing Cepheid and TRGB measurements while extending the distance ladder in the era of infrared space missions such as JWST and Roman Space Telescope, which will have difficulty discovering Cepheids. Miras are pulsating variable stars that follow tight (~0.12 mag scatter) Period-Luminosity Relations (PLRs) in the near-infrared (NIR). Short-period Miras (P &lt; 400 d) have NIR luminosities up to 2 mag brighter than TRGB and are a ubiquitous older population that have already been used to calibrate H0 with 5% uncertainty. Long-period Miras (P &gt; 400 d) are highly luminous and follow a different PLR from short-period Miras. We will (1) obtain a new distance measurement to this galaxy using short-period Miras, resulting in a sub-3% calibration of H0 with Miras when combined with existing Mira-SN Ia hosts; (2) discover long- period Miras with HST for the first time; (3) cross-correlate long-period variables discovered in HST with Spitzer IR observations. To do this, we propose to obtain 5 epochs of near-infrared observation in M101, to study Miras in the field of SN Ia 2011fe. Combining these with archival observations of the late-time lightcurve of SN 2011fe results in ~10 epochs of observation with a baseline of ~3000 days., Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the formation of solar prominences or filaments, among which direct injection and evaporation-condensation models are the two most popular ones. In the direct injection model, cold plasma is ejected from the chromosphere into the corona along magnetic field lines; in the evaporation-condensation model, the cold chromospheric plasma is heated to over a million degrees and is evaporated into the corona, where the accumulated plasma finally reaches thermal instability or nonequilibrium so as to condensate to cold prominences. In this paper, we try to unify the two mechanisms: The essence of filament formation is the localized heating in the chromosphere. If the heating happens in the lower chromosphere, the enhanced gas pressure pushes the cold plasma in the upper chromosphere to move up to the corona, such a process is manifested as the direct injection model. If the heating happens in the upper chromosphere, the local plasma is heated to 1-2 million degrees, and is evaporated into the corona. Later, the plasma condensates to form a prominence. Such a process is manifested as the evaporation-condensation model. With radiative hydrodynamic simulations we confirmed that the two widely accepted formation mechanisms of solar prominences can really be unified in such a single framework. A particular case is also found where both injection and evaporation-condensation processes occur together., The heating by photo-ionization in the thermosphere of short-period exoplanets can drive hydrodynamic escape, which is key to understanding the evolution of the planet atmosphere and explaining the atmospheric measurements. Besides powering the atmosphere escape, the energy deposited by EUV photons from the host star can also be radiated away through collisional excited atomic spectral lines, leading the mass loss rate to fall significantly below the energy limit. Recent observations have detected atomic Mg and Fe features in the transmission spectrum of several hot Jupiters. Studying the signature of these atomic lines not only can reveal the structure of the upper atmosphere, but also constrain the radiative cooling rates. To understand these features, we construct a sophisticated forward model by expanding the capability of the exoplanet hydrodynamic atmosphere code of Koskinen et al. (2013) to calculate processes of atomic metal species and compare the results with available observations. In the talk, I will explain our model and show the effect of metal species and Roche Lobe overflow., Penetration electric fields during geomagnetic storms have important effects on the equatorial ionospheric electrodynamics. Previous studies focus on the vertical ion drifts, corresponding to electric fields in the zonal direction, in the equatorial ionosphere. In this study, we analyze the characteristics of the zonal ion drifts in the equatorial region measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites during ten severe magnetic storms with a minimum Dst &lt; -200 nT in the solar maximum years of 2000-2003. It is found that the net change of the equatorial zonal ion drifts caused by magnetic storms is westward and can reach 200-300 m/s in the evening sector and that the westward ion drifts remain in the same direction during both the storm main and recovery phases. The storm-induced zonal ion drifts are highly correlated with the Dst index, the correlation coefficient between the average zonal drift and the average Dst value during the ten storms is 0.89. The magnitude of the storm-induced westward ion drifts is approximately linearly proportional to the Dst index in the evening sector, and on average, a change of -100 nT in Dst causes a change of -52 m/s in the zonal drift. A new mechanism is proposed to explain the generation of the westward plasma drifts in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere. This new mechanism is that the poleward electric fields associated with the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) penetrate or extend to low latitudes, producing the westward plasma drifts in the equatorial region. The results of this study provide new insight into equatorial ionospheric electrodynamics during geomagnetic storms., During magnetic storms, energy is transferred from the solar wind to the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system. Energy input is dominated by electromagnetic power in the form of Poynting flux (PF) which can be dissipated as Joule heat in the ionosphere. Accurate specification of PF is central to any study of the response of the IT system to solar wind forcing. In our past work, we have reported on the discrepancies between observed PF for individual storm events and empirical models frequently used. In this paper, we summarize the results of our computed PF for 36 magnetic storms, during which 40 main phases were observed. <P />We subdivide our storm events into pre-storm quiet intervals, initial, main, and recovery phases. We use field and particle data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites in our analysis. These are used in combination to (1) compute the electromagnetic power and (2) assign a location where the PF is measured, based on the precipitation particle characteristics observed simultaneously with the field measurements. From this characterization based on precipitating particles, we obtain a map of the source regions of PF for each of the phases of the storms under study, dividing PF locations into open and closed field line regions. Polar distributions show significant levels of PF at very high latitudes during all storm phases. There are distinct hemispheric asymmetries between spatial distributions and levels of PF. The locations of the open and closed field lines in this study, based on particle characteristics, show surprising mixing of latitudes and local times, presumably due to the dynamic nature of boundary motions during magnetic storms., From 2015 to 2019, the Van Allen Probes total radiation belt electron content shows a steady increase as time moves from solar maximum to solar minimum. However, the FIREBIRD CubeSats, measuring primarily precipitating electrons at the low-Earth orbit, show the opposite trend from the radiation belt data near the equator. The goal of this study is to understand the different responses between the trapped and precipitated relativistic electrons during this half solar cycle. To reach the goal, we compare measurements from Van Allen Probes at the smallest pitch angle bin, FIREBIRD CubeSats, and POES satellites to investigate the long-term variation of electrons from 200 keV to several MeV. We investigate the possible explanations of the opposite data results from storm types (CME or CIR), electron energy spectrum, L-shell profile, hemispheric differences, and instrument performance through time. A better understanding of the loss cone region will help to improve our estimates on electron precipitation rate toward more robust predictions of the radiation belt dynamic and its atmospheric impact., The research on increased ductility of organic-rich shale and its impacts on the hydraulic fracturing have received relatively little attention, and thus are worthy of further investigation. The popular cohesive zone model that only features decreasing traction along with crack separation may not adequately represent the crack behavior in shale due to ample organic matter. This paper starts by proposing a modified cohesive zone model that can represent various traction-separation laws (TSL) within a unified formulation. Then a fully coupled poroelastic XFEM framework to simulate hydraulic fracturing in organic-rich shales was developed in Matlab and comprehensively verified against latest analytical solutions. The influences of increased ductility in different forms were studied using the modified cohesive zone model in the context of field-scale hydraulic fracturing simulations. Three important conclusions were drawn. First, the shape of TSL does affect the hydraulic fracturing given the same cohesive crack energy and tensile strength. It infers that ductility is not only controlled by cohesive crack energy and tensile strength, which further indicates the necessity of the newly proposed TSL. Second, the tensile strength, controlling when the cohesive crack starts propagating, has the greatest impacts on the hydraulic fracturing, among all TSL shape parameters. The impacts of TSL parameters become less significant as the fracturing fluid viscosity increases. Lastly, Young's modulus is the only one among four common poroelastic parameters that significantly changes the ductility/brittleness of rock formation and hydraulic fracture lengths. The increase in cohesive energy accompanied by the decrease of Young's modulus will greatly reduce the induced fracture length., , The heating by photo-ionization in the thermosphere of short-period exoplanets can drive hydrodynamic escape, which is key to understanding the evolution of the planet atmosphere and explaining the atmospheric measurements. Besides powering the atmosphere escape, the energy deposited by EUV photons from the host star can also be radiated away through collisional excited atomic spectral lines, leading the mass loss rate to fall significantly below the energy limit. Recent observations have detected evidence of atomic Mg and Fe absorptions in the NUV transmission spectrum of hot Jupiter WASP-121b and HD 209458b. Studying the signature of these atomic lines not only can reveal the structure of the upper atmosphere, but also constrain the radiative cooling rates. These lines will also be detectable by the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE) satellite that will monitor extrasolar giant planets for evidence of mass loss and magnetic fields. In this work, we expand the capability of the exoplanet hydrodynamic atmosphere code of Koskinen et al. (2013) to calculate processes of atomic metal species and compare the results with available observations., The discrepancy between local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) and the value inferred from observations of the CMB under the assumption of a Lambda-CDM cosmological model may be our strongest indication of new physics. Direct, distance-ladder measurements of the H0 rely primarily on Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) to calibrate the luminosity of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). An independent approach using Mira variables can check existing Cepheid and TRGB measurements while extending the distance ladder in the era of infrared space missions such as JWST and WFIRST, which will have difficulty discovering Cepheids. Miras are pulsating variable stars that follow tight (~0.12 mag scatter) Period-Luminosity Relations (PLRs) in the near-infrared (NIR). Short-period Miras (P &lt; 400 days) have NIR luminosities up to 2 mag brighter than TRGB and are a ubiquitous older population that have already been used to calibrate H0 with 5% uncertainty. Long-period Miras (P &gt; 400 days) are highly luminous and follow a different PLR from short-period Miras. Using archival observations obtained to study the late-time lightcurve of SN 2011fe, we will (1) derive a new distance measurement to this galaxy using short-period Miras, resulting in a sub-3% calibration of H0 with Miras when combined with existing Mira-SN Ia hosts; (2) search long-period Miras with HST for the first time in a SN Ia host galaxy; (3) cross-correlate long-period variables discovered in HST with Spitzer IR observations., We present year-long, near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 observations used to search for Mira variables in NGC 1559, the host galaxy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2005df. This is the first dedicated search for Miras, highly evolved low-mass stars, in an SN Ia host, and subsequently the first calibration of the SN Ia luminosity using Miras in a role historically played by Cepheids. We identify a sample of 115 O-rich Miras with P &lt; 400 days based on their light-curve properties. We find that the scatter in the Mira period-luminosity relation (PLR) is comparable to Cepheid PLRs seen in SN Ia host galaxies. Using a sample of O-rich Miras discovered in NGC 4258 with HSTF160W and its maser distance, we measure a distance modulus for NGC 1559 of ${\mu }_{1559}=31.41\pm 0.050$ (statistical) $\pm 0.060$ (systematic) mag. Based on the light curve of the normal, well-observed, low-reddening SN 2005df, we obtain a measurement of the fiducial SN Ia absolute magnitude of ${M}_{B}^{0}=-19.27\pm 0.13$ mag. With the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia we find ${H}_{0}=72.7\pm 4.6$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Combining the calibration from the NGC 4258 megamaser and the Large Magellanic Cloud detached eclipsing binaries gives a best value of ${H}_{0}=73.3\pm 4.0$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. This result is within 1σ of the Hubble constant derived using Cepheids and multiple calibrating SNe Ia. This is the first of four expected calibrations of the SN Ia luminosity from Miras that should reduce the error in H<SUB>0</SUB> via Miras to ∼3%. In light of the present Hubble tension and JWST, Miras have utility in the extragalactic distance scale to check Cepheid distances or calibrate nearby SNe in early-type host galaxies that would be unlikely targets for Cepheid searches., Pure CO ice has been irradiated with electrons of energy in the range 150-1000 eV with the Interstellar Energetic-Process System. The main products of irradiation are carbon chains C<SUB>n</SUB> (n = 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), suboxides, C<SUB>n</SUB>O (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), and C<SUB>n</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> (n = 1, 3, 4, 5, 7) species. CO<SUB>2</SUB> is by far the most abundant reaction product in all the experiments. The destruction cross section of CO peaks at about 250 eV, decreases with the energy of the electrons and is more than one order of magnitude higher than for gas-phase CO ionization. The production cross section of carbon dioxide has been also derived and is characterized by the competition between chemistry and desorption. Desorption of CO and of new species during the radiolysis follows the electron distribution in the ice. Low-energy electrons having short penetration depths induce significant desorption. Finally, as the ice thickness approaches the electron penetration depth the abundance of the products starts to saturate. Implications on the atmospheric photochemistry of cold planets hosting surface CO ices are also discussed., In this study, we calculate the radiation belt electron loss through precipitation into the atmosphere and simulate the electron impact on atmospheric composition. While the influence of auroral electrons in the atmosphere and ionosphere have been studied extensively, the radiation belt electrons' contribution is not well known. <P />This work combines measurements from Van Allen Probes near the equator and FIREBIRD CubeSat at low-Earth orbit, to estimate the spatial and temporal variations of the electron precipitation flux and energy spectrum between 200 keV and 1 MeV. We calculate the flux ratio between the Van Allen Probes and FIREBIRD data during conjunctions to estimate the electron precipitation rate. We found that 90% of the time, the electron precipitation rate is less than 3%. However, during a strong electron loss event, the precipitation rate is 75% at the energy of 900 keV. <P />To quantify the contribution of radiation belt electrons to the atmosphere, we use a global climate simulation (NCAR-WACCM) to calculate the production of HOx and NOx, and the reduction in O3. The preliminary WACCM result shows a substantial reduction of O3 (30%) at 70 km caused by a moderate radiation belt electron precipitation event. Next, we will simulate a stronger precipitation event and assess the electron energy dependence of the atmospheric impact., Penetration electric fields originating from the solar wind/magnetosphere, shielding electric fields produced by the region-2 field-aligned currents, and disturbance dynamo electric fields produced by disturbance neutral winds are the major disturbance electric fields in the middle- and low-latitude ionosphere during geomagnetic storms. Understanding the interplay of electric fields from different sources is critical for understanding storm-time ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, we analyze ionospheric data measured by five Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites near dusk during a magnetic storm. A peculiar feature in this case is that the vertical ion drift was enhanced in the upward direction by up to 180 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, corresponding to the occurrence of an eastward penetration electric field in the equatorial ionosphere, for 14 hours, including 3 hours of the storm main phase and the first 11 hours of the recovery phase. The variations of other ionospheric parameters (the ion density, ion composition, electron temperature, and zonal drift) were well correlated with the variation of the vertical ion drifts, providing further evidence of prolonged penetration electric fields. This is the first observation of continuous penetration electric fields over 14 hours. Mechanisms and scenarios for occurrence of long-lasting penetration electric fields are proposed., The polar outflows, as an important plasma source of the earth's magnetosphere, usually exhibit significant north-south asymmetries, which can strongly affect the plasma distributions in the magnetotail lobe and perhaps contribute to the substorm triggering. But the mechanism of the asymmetric transport of these outflows is still unclear. In this letter, 3-D global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are performed to investigate the development of the polar outflows after their escapes from the inner boundary under influences of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>x</SUB>. It is found that the velocity of northern polar outflows is much stronger than the south. We suggest that the IMF B<SUB>x</SUB> causes the north-south asymmetries in the magnetospheric configuration, and subsequently, great differences of the force and mass distributions appear between the two hemispheres, which lead to the significant north-south asymmetries in the transport of the polar outflows. We also discuss the differences in the acceleration mechanisms of the polar outflows between the northward and southward IMF cases., We have analyzed the electromagnetic and particle energy observed by DMSP spacecraft for 44 magnetic storms which occurred between 2002 and 2012. We divide the time intervals into pre-storm; storm main ","['10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.225101', '2024PhRvL.133v5101H', '10.48550/arXiv.2312.08423', '2024ApJ...963...83H', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ff8',

We present Subaru SCExAO/CHARIS infrared spectroscopy of HIP 93398 B, a brown dwarf companion recently discovered by Y. Li et al. (2023), as part of an informed survey using the Hipparcos–Gaia Catalog of Accelerations. This object was previously classified as a T6 dwarf based on its luminosity, with its independently derived age and dynamical mass in tension with existing models of brown dwarf evolution. Spectral typing via empirical standard spectra, temperatures derived by fitting substellar atmosphere models, and J ‑ H, J ‑ K and <inline-formula> </inline-formula> colors all suggest that this object has a substantially higher temperature and luminosity, consistent with classification as a late-L dwarf near the L/T transition (T = <inline-formula> </inline-formula> K) with moderate to thick clouds possibly present in its atmosphere. When compared with the latest generation of evolution models that account for clouds with our revised luminosity and temperature for the object, the tension between the model-independent mass/age and model predictions is resolved., The 16 Myr old A0V star HD 156623 in the Scorpius–Centaurus association hosts a high-fractional-luminosity debris disk, recently resolved in scattered light for the first time by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) in polarized intensity only. We present a new analysis of the GPI H-band polarimetric detection of the HD 156623 debris disk, with particular interest in its unique morphology. This debris disk lacks a visible inner clearing, unlike the majority of low-inclination disks in the GPI sample and in Sco-Cen, and it is known to contain CO gas, positioning it as a candidate ""hybrid"" or ""shielded"" disk. We use radiative transfer models to constrain the geometric parameters of the disk based on scattered light data and thermal models to constrain the unresolved inner radius based on the system's spectral energy distribution (SED). We also compute a measurement of the polarized scattering phase function, adding to the existing sample of empirical phase function measurements. We find that HD 156623's debris disk inner radius is constrained to less than 26.6 au from scattered light imagery and less than 13.4 au from SED modeling at a 99.7% confidence interval and suggest that gas drag may play a role in retaining sub-blowout-size dust grains so close to the star., HD 156623 hosts a high-fractional-luminosity debris disk, recently resolved in scattered light for the first time by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI).

Among these resources is a set of open-source lesson plans designed to help educators incorporate Astrobites articles and resources into their classrooms. In this study, we aim to determine the effectiveness of these lesson plans in increasing students' perceived understanding of and confidence in astronomy. During the 2022-2023 academic year, twelve faculty members incorporated our lesson plans into their classes, surveyed their students before and after the activities, and participated in follow-up interviews at the end of their classes. Quantitative survey data clearly show that students' perceptions of their abilities with jargon, identifying main takeaways of a paper, conceptual understanding of physics and astronomy, and communicating scientific results all improved with use of the Astrobites lesson plans. Additionally, students show evidence of increased confidence and sense of belonging within astronomy after exposure to these lessons. These findings suggest that incorporating current research in the undergraduate classroom through accessible, scaffolded resources like Astrobites may increase students' ability to engage with research literature, as well as their preparation for participation in research and applied careers., Undergraduate physics and astronomy students are expected to engage with scientific literature as they begin their research careers, but reading comprehension skills are rarely explicitly taught in major courses. We seek to determine the efficacy of lesson plans designed to improve undergraduate astronomy (or related) majors' perceived ability to engage with research literature by using accessible summaries of current research written by experts in the field. During the 2022-2023 academic year, twelve faculty members incorporated lesson plans using accessible summaries from Astrobites into their undergraduate astronomy major courses, surveyed their students before and after the activities, and participated in follow-up interviews with our research team. Quantitative and qualitative survey data clearly show that students' perceptions of their abilities with jargon, identifying main takeaways of a paper, conceptual understanding of physics and astronomy, and communicating scientific results all improved with use of the tested lesson plans. Additionally, students show evidence of increased confidence of their abilities within astronomy after exposure to these lessons, and instructors valued a ready-to-use resource to incorporate reading comprehension in their pedagogy. This case study with Astrobites-based lesson plans suggests that incorporating current research in the undergraduate classroom through accessible literature summaries may increase students' confidence and ability to engage with research literature, as well as their preparation for participation in research and applied careers., We introduce a new framework for point-spread function subtraction based on the spatiotemporal variation of speckle noise in high-contrast imaging data where the sampling timescale is faster than the speckle evolution timescale. One way that space-time covariance arises in the pupil is as atmospheric layers translate across the telescope aperture and create small, time-varying perturbations in the phase of the incoming wavefront. The propagation of this field to the focal plane preserves some of that space-time covariance. To utilize this covariance, our new approach uses a Karhunen-Loève transform on an image sequence, as opposed to a set of single reference images as in previous applications of Karhunen-Loève Image Processing (KLIP) for high-contrast imaging. With the recent development of photon-counting detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors, this technique now has the potential to improve contrast when used as a post-processing step. Preliminary testing on simulated data shows this technique can improve contrast by at least 10%-20% from the original image, with significant potential for further improvement. For certain choices of parameters, this algorithm may provide larger contrast gains than spatial-only KLIP., Disability is broadly defined as ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."" While 1 in 4 Americans has a disability, only 10% of undergraduates in STEM and 1% of PhD students in STEM have disabilities, highlighting a serious problem with accessibility in science (Aarnio 2020). Yet, accessibility and disability are often overlooked in DEI efforts — despite a large number of white papers focusing on inclusion and equity in the Astro2020 Decadal Survey, the survey's recommendations only include disability as a side note instead of a crucial component of improving the state of the profession. In this talk, I will discuss challenges faced specifically by disabled astronomers in our field, share personal experiences with accessibility and creating accessible events (e.g. planetarium shows accessible to blind and d/Deaf audiences), highlight the work of leaders in accessibility in astronomy, and make recommendations for how you can contribute to accessibility. Accessibility creates a better experience for everyone, regardless of disability — and we should keep it at the forefront of discussions of DEI., For many students, introductory college science courses are often the only opportunity in their formal higher education to be exposed to science, shaping their view of the subject, their scientific literacy, and their attitudes towards their own ability in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). While science writing instruction has been demonstrated to impact attitudes and outlooks of STEM majors in their coursework, this instructional strategy has yet to be explored for non-majors. In this work, we investigate student attitudes towards STEM before and after taking a writing-intensive introductory astronomy course. We find that students cite writing about science as beneficial to their learning, deepening their understanding of science topics and their perspective on science as a field and finding writing to be a ""bridge"" between STEM content and their focus on humanities in their majors. Students also report increased perceptions of their own ability and confidence in engaging with STEM across multiple metrics, leaving the course more prepared to be informed, engaged, and science literate citizens., Astrobites is a graduate student-run website, aimed at making current astrophysical research accessible to a broader audience by publishing plain-language summaries of recent research papers. Since its founding in December 2010, Astrobites has featured more than 3,000 posts written by over 100 contributors spread across many continents. Weekday posts summarize cutting-edge research papers from the ArXiv preprint server, while additional ""beyond astro-ph"" content includes career advice, conference live-blogging, summaries of landmark astronomy papers, and more. Our audience includes undergraduate students, graduate students, professional scientists and astronomy enthusiasts. Astrobites has inspired similar science communication efforts in other languages as well as scientific disciplines. At AAS 240, we will share new efforts from Astrobites to cover topics related to climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to expand our collection of resources for educators to use Astrobites in the classroom., We introduce a new framework for point-spread function (PSF) subtraction based on the spatio-temporal variation of speckle noise in high contrast imaging data where the sampling timescale is faster than the speckle evolution timescale.

With the recent development of photon counting detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), this technique now has the potential to improve contrast when used as a post-processing step. Preliminary testing on simulated data shows this technique improves contrast, but further gains may be realized with further improvements to the technique., A passive neutron-bubble dosimeter, developed by Bubble Technology Industries, has been used for space applications. This study provides a means to characterize the response of these detectors to various particle types in support of bubble-detector measurements made on board the International Space Station (ISS) in Low Earth Orbit. An analysis of the radiation environment onboard the ISS in the Service Module with the OLTARIS code indicates that neutrons, protons, and lower atomic mass particles are the more abundant particles. Based on a Monte Carlo treatment with the Stopping Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) code, the response functions of the lighter ions were determined. This assessment considered the maximum linear energy transfer of these ions at the end of their path (Bragg peak) in the detector that exceeded the minimum threshold to cause bubble nucleation. The model was benchmarked against previous heavy-ion measurements in ground-based accelerator studies. The model was able to successfully predict, for a beam oriented along the detector axis, the observed energies at which the ions penetrated and exited the detector as well as the relative scaling of the response curves. By folding in the calculated particle fluxes with both the predicted light-ion response functions, as well as using experimental responses for neutrons, protons and alpha particles measured in previous accelerator studies, the contribution of particles in space to the bubble count was evaluated. This analysis shows that for an isotropic-irradiation geometry in space, neutrons are the major contributors to the bubble count with a much smaller contribution from protons., Basic functionality exists but needs to be tested, Pluto's surface is geologically complex because of volatile ices that are mobile on seasonal and longer time scales. Here we analyzed New Horizons LEISA spectral data to globally map the nitrogen ice, including nitrogen with methane diluted in it. Our goal was to learn about the seasonal processes influencing ice redistribution, to calculate the globally averaged energy balance, and to place a lower limit on Pluto's N<SUB>2</SUB> inventory. We present the average latitudinal distribution of nitrogen and investigate the relationship between its distribution and topography on Pluto by using maps that include the shifted bands of methane in solid solution with nitrogen (which are much stronger than the 2.15- μm nitrogen band) to more completely map the distribution of the nitrogen ice. We find that the global average bolometric albedo is 0 . 83 ± 0 . 11 , similar to that inferred for Triton, and that a significant fraction of Pluto's N<SUB>2</SUB> is stored in Sputnik Planitia. We also used the encounter-hemisphere distribution of nitrogen ice to infer the latitudinal distribution of nitrogen over the rest of Pluto, allowing us to calculate the global energy balance. Under the assumption that Pluto's nitrogen-dominated 11.5 μbar atmosphere is in vapor pressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice, the ice temperature is 36 . 93 ± 0 . 10 K, as measured by New Horizons' REX instrument. Combined with our global energy balance calculation, this implies that the average bolometric emissivity of Pluto's nitrogen ice is probably in the range 0.47-0.72. This is consistent with the low emissivities estimated for Triton based on Voyager results, and may have implications for Pluto's atmospheric seasonal variations, as discussed below. The global pattern of volatile transport at the time of the encounter was from north to south, and the transition between condensation and sublimation within Sputnik Planitia is correlated with changes in the grain size and CH<SUB>4</SUB> concentration derived from the spectral maps. The low emissivity of Pluto's N<SUB>2</SUB> ice suggests that Pluto's atmosphere may undergo an extended period of constant pressure even as Pluto recedes from the Sun in its orbit., Pluto's surface is geologically complex, to a significant extent because of volatile ice frosts that are mobile on seasonal and longer time scales. Here, we analyze New Horizons LEISA spectral data to globally map the nitrogen ice, including nitrogen with methane diluted in it, in order to learn about the seasonal processes influencing ice redistribution, and to calculate the globally averaged energy balance. We take advantage of the shifted bands of methane in solid solution with nitrogen, which are much stronger than the 2.15-micron nitrogen band, to more completely map the distribution of the nitrogen ice. We present the resulting maps of the encounter-hemisphere distribution of nitrogen, as well as characterization of its average latitudinal dependence and an examination of how the distribution at the global scale depends on topography. We also use the encounter-hemisphere distribution of nitrogen ice to infer the latitudinal distribution of nitrogen over the rest of Pluto, allowing us to calculate the global energy balance. Under the assumption that Pluto's nitrogen-dominated 11.5 microbar atmosphere is in vapor-pressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice, the ice temperature is 37.18±0.10 K. Combined with our global energy balance calculation, this implies that the average bolometric emissivity of Pluto's nitrogen ice is probably in the range 0.5 - 0.9, and that there is a significant reservoir of N2 ice in the un-illuminated areas south of -38° latitude. The global pattern of volatile transport at the time of the encounter was from north to south, with condensation of volatile ices likely occurring southward from approximately Pluto's equator (including in the un-illuminated regions south of -38° latitude). The transition between condensation and sublimation within Sputnik Planitia is correlated with changes in the grain size and CH4 concentration derived from the spectral maps. The low emissivity of Pluto's N2 ice suggests that Pluto's atmosphere may undergo an extended period of constant pressure even as Pluto recedes from the Sun in its orbit., Pluto’s surface is known to consist of various volatile ices, mostly N2, CH4, and CO, which sublimate and condense on varying timescales, generally moving from points of high insolation to those of low insolation. The New Horizons Pluto encounter data provide multiple lenses through which to view Pluto’s detailed surface topography and composition and to investigate the distribution of volatiles on its surface, including albedo and elevation maps from the imaging instruments and composition maps from the LEISA spectral imager. The volatile surface ice is expected to be generally isothermal, due to the fact that their vapor pressures are in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Although secular topographic transport mechanisms suggest that points at low elevation should slowly fill with volatile ices (Trafton 2015 DPS abstract, Bertrand and Forget 2017), there are counter-examples of this across the surface, implying that energy discrepancies caused by insolation differences, albedo variations, local slopes, and other effects may take precedence at shorter timescales. Using data from the 2015 New Horizons flyby, we present our results of this investigation into the effects of variations in insolation, albedo, and topography on the presence of the different volatile ices across the surface of Pluto., Pluto’s surface is known to consist of various volatile ices, mostly N2, CH4, and CO, which sublimate and condense on varying timescales, generally moving from points of high insolation to those of low insolation.

At Xmas 2012, an intense, new, 1665 MHz feature at ∼3v<SUB>e</SUB> appeared, which points to the initiation of a jet in this post-AGB star., The ratio “light curve” generated from the two peak 1612 MHz fluxes of WX Psc exhibits cusps. These are attributable to the abrupt formation of dust as the leading edge of a shockwave reaches the dust formation zone., An inventory of circumstellar shells in the Arecibo sky {| b | &gt; 10\deg \&amp; | l | &lt; 90\deg} with MIR colors appropriate for OH/IR stars shows that up to 75\% do not exhibit 1612 MHz masers above the present Arecibo 5 mJy detection threshold: indeed some of these 'mimics' do not exhibit mainline OH or 22 GHz water masers either, whereas more than 90\% of OH/IR stars do. Low-mass OH/IR stars are expected to pass through a proto planetary nebula (PPN) phase once dM/dt \rightarrow 0, while their fossil shells disperse, prior to becoming planetary nebulae. But there is only one PPN candidate without an OH maser to match the sample's 118 mimics, where \sim8 are expected if mimics evolve directly into PPN (ApJ 533, 959: 2000). Inferentially, therefore, most mimics evolve into OH/IR stars before becoming PPN. Thus a mimic is the immediate precursor of every OH/IR star. At least one star has been seen to match this scenario: V1511 Cyg. While 1612 MHz observations at Arecibo and Nan\c{c}ay show that it was a mimic from 1986 to 1992, V1511 Cyg exhibited a classic, double-peaked profile that had an easily detected 332 mJy peak intensity in May 1999. Its light curve, which has since been followed for 10 years, shows substantial changes in the peak intensities of its red \&amp; blue-shifted masers. It is likely that the earlier 'mimic' phase in this case was the result of the masing intensity dropping below the 60 mJy threshold for detection by pre-1999 observations at Arecibo., In computer codes used to estimate the aircrew radiation exposure from galactic cosmic radiation, a quiet sun model is usually assumed. A revised computer code (PCAIRE ver. 8.0f) is used to calculate the impact of noisy sun conditions on aircrew radiation exposure. The revised code incorporates the effect of solar storm activity, which can perturb the geomagnetic field lines, altering cutoff rigidities and hence the shielding capability of the Earth's magnetic field. The effect of typical solar storm conditions on aircrew radiation exposure is shown to be minimal justifying the usual assumptions., The 1612 MHz light curves of high latitude OH/IR stars have been observed for several years with the Arecibo 305m telescope, to derive the light-travel time diameter of their shells from the phase difference between their red and blue shifted peaks, and to look for secular evolution of their masers. However, direct intensity measurements are always limited by the extent to which the telescope's characteristics can be removed. These, in Arecibo's case, are subject to changes in the weight distribution about the structure over time, to the functioning of the vertical tie-down system, which can be interrupted by thunder storms, and by temperature-related zenith angle effects during daytime observations. Nevertheless, all of these limitations are neutralized when the ratio of the two peaks is used as the observed parameter. This form of differential photometry often results in clean light curves, though the ratio may still be perturbed by RFI, by interstellar scintillation, and more predictably by noise. <P />The increased sensitivity of this observing mode readily detects (1) any differential evolution of the two masers, as well as (2) highlighting changes in masing gain between the two peaks around the pulsation cycle, that in turn are indicative of the operation of partially rather than fully saturated masers. In many of our light-curves there are abrupt changes in the ratio of the peak intensities at a constant pulsation phase. These are interpreted as being due to the onset of dust formation at that phase of the pulsation cycle, with a consequent abrupt change in the reprocessing of the stellar SED, and hence to an abrupt change in the maser pump. This is a feature of the Gray, Howe &amp; Lewis (MN 364, 783 (2005)) maser model. Examples of these effects will be shown., The radio spectrum is a finite resource, on which humanity makes many demands. And pressure on it is ever increasing with the development of new technology and ideas for radio services. After all, we all benefit from wifi and cell phones. Radio astronomers have a small percentage of the spectrum allocated to them at octave intervals in the metre-centimetre bands, and at important frequencies, such as that of the 21cm line of HI. Signals from other services, as well as from our own poorly-engineered equipment, sometimes contaminate our bands: these signals constitute RFI. These may totally obliterate the astronomical signal, or, in the case of CLOUDSAT, may be capable of completely destroying a receiver, which introduces us to the new possibility of 'destructive interference'. A geo-stationary satellite can block access to a piece of sky from one site. <P />Good equipment design eliminates self-inflicted interference, while physical separation often provides adequate practical mitigation at many frequencies. However, new observatories end up being located in the West Australian desert or Antarctica. In future they may be on the back side of the Moon. But there is no Earth-bound protection via physical separation against satellite signals. Some mitigation can be achieved by frequent data dumps and the excision of RFI, or by real-time detection and blanking of the receiver, or by more sophisticated algoriths. Astronomers of necessity aim to achieve mitigation via coordination, at the local level, and by participating in spectrum management at the national and international levels. This involves them spending a lot of time in Geneva at the International Telegraphic Union protecting their access to spectrum, and access to clean spectrum from the L3 point and the far side of the Moon., Only low mass OH/IR stars were seen to lose their 1612 MHz masers since 1985, while those of IRAS 19479+2111 also switched ON again. These phenomena are expected from changes to the maser pump consequent on large changes in mass-loss rate, dM/dt. Further, models show that when dM/dt - &gt; 0, for 50 years afterwards the (25-12) μ m color of a circumstellar shell is little changed, though its H-K quickly gets bluer. By revisiting the statistics from the complete, high-latitude subset of the Arecibo survey, we find 100% of MIR selected sources are detected when (25-12) μ m &gt; -0.45. Thus no star with redder MIR colors should exhibit modulated 1612 MHz masers. Further our statistics show that 50% of sources are detected when -0.55 &lt; (25-12) μ m &lt; -0 .50, and 30% when -0.60 &lt; (25-12) μ m 0.40, whereas many of the 1612 MHz nondetections or mimics are bluer. This is expected if the nondetections are currently latched in a modulated OFF state by their current dM/dt, while leaving them with the MIR colors of OH/IR stars. Thus 26% of the mimics with -0.65 &lt; (25-12) μ m &lt; -0.60 and 38% of those with -0.70 &lt; (25-12) μ m &lt; -0.65 have H-K &lt; 0.4. We will present the full NIR statistics for the Arecibo high-latitude sample to confirm this expectation, and test for any difference in spectral type between the OH/IR stars and the mimics., 80% of the most massive OH/IR stars with the reddest mid-infrared colors appear to have detached shells: these are due to a strongly modulated mass-loss rate on a much longer time-scale than their pulsational periods. The complete switching OFF &amp; ON of 1612 MHz masers in the low-mass star IRAS 19479+2111 suggests now that all OH/IR stars have a strongly modulated dM/dt., Hubble images of the Cat's Eye and Egg nebulae exhibit concentric rings, so when they were AGB stars, their mass-loss rates were strongly modulated with a period of 100 years. Most OH/IR stars share this feature since:- <P />(1) The NIR colors of OH/IR stars fall on a tight locus in a two-color 2MASS plot, but the most massive objects with the reddest IRAS colors are widely distributed, instead of being at its red end, as would occur if shells were generated by a constant dM/dt. Our (AJ 132, 489) DUSTY models with a range of constant dM/dt or ages for detached shells both trace the locus when one uses a stellar SED matching its bluest colors and cold silicate dust. Hence the wide NIR color distribution of the thermally pulsing OH/IR stars with the reddest IRAS colors is an artifact of a modulated dM/dt. <P />(2) The resurrection of 1612 MHz masers in the OH/IR star IRAS 19479+2111. We (MN 364, 783 2005) successfully modelled Arecibo observations of the disappearance of 1612 MHz masers from OH/IR stars on a time-scale of a decade assuming a step decrease in dM/dt. We used a time-dependent model for the consequent changes in the OH column density and a radiative transfer code to follow the masers. The decline in the 1612 MHz masers is traced to changes in the 53 μm pump, consequent on changes in reprocessing of the stellar SED when dust in the zone around the dust-formation radius is removed by the ongoing expansion of the circumstellar shell. The reappearance of 1612 MHz masers in IRAS 19479+2111 (BAAS 37, 1335 2005) indicates the resumption of significant dM/dt and dust formation after a period of reduced dM/dt. This low mass star clearly experiences a strong modulation of its dM/dt., OH/IR stars fall on a well-defined locus in two-color near-IR (NIR) plots. This locus is replicated by a sequence of self-consistent radiative-transfer models of shells with long-term constant mass loss provided that (1) the initial stellar spectral energy distribution has NIR colors matching those at the foot of the locus and (2) a cold-silicate dust opacity function is used. The models depend on the public code DUSTY. The NIR locus is also followed by models of detached shells: our models are based on shells generated by a constant dM/dt within which a central hole grows, so an expansion-time chronology can be attached to the color evolution of a detached shell. This also provides an upper limit on the time for 1612 MHz masers to disappear after dM/dt--&gt;0. The brevity of this timescale shows that the pumping of 1612 MHz masers is very dependant on the reprocessing of the stellar radiation field occurring within 5r<SUB>d</SUB> of the star (where r<SUB>d</SUB> is the radius of the hottest dust), which explains why they can disappear on timescales of less than two decades. Our second concern is to explain the distribution along the NIR locus of the OH/IR stars with the reddest IRAS colors, which appear to have ``detached'' shells, even though many are mid-IR (MIR) variables. Since the NIR locus is followed by shells generated by any form of dM/dt, whether constant, interrupted, or periodic, these MIR variables show that most thick, oxygen-rich, circumstellar shells exhibit a severe cyclical modulation in their mass-loss rates, as predicted by Simis in 2001., Detached shells can be identified from their NIR &amp; MIR colours. We use this to identify PPN candidates, including three like IRAS 18455+0448. These are 19178+1206, 18470+0015 &amp; 18123+0511., IRAS 19479+2111 exhibited an idiosyncratic set of 1612 MHz masers with peak intensities of 134 to 271 mJy &amp; velocities of 2 -10 km/s when first searched in May 1987. These had completely disappeared when the object was revisited in June 2000 after the completion of the Arecibo Gregorian upgrade, and were not seen at any of the 10 epochs checked during the next 2.5 yr. Our observations set a &lt;2 mJy limit on the intensity of any 1612 MHz emission during 2000-2002, so the masers had faded by a factor &gt;100 for an interval mu","['2024arXiv241106003L', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad90bc', '10.48550/arXiv.2411.06003', '2024ApJ...977..247L', 'arXiv:2411.06003', '2024AJ....168..142L', '2024arXiv240715986L', '10.48550/arXiv.2407.15986', 'arXiv:2407.15986', '10.3847/1538-3881/ad67e1', '2024AAS...24315106L', '2024AAS...24334508L', '2023arXiv230905822L', 'arXiv:2309.05822', '10.48550/arXiv.2309.05822', 'arXiv:2301.01291', '2023AJ....165...59L', '10.3847/1538-3881/aca761', '10.48550/arXiv.2301.01291', '2023arXiv230101291L', '2023AAS...24125A04L', 'arXiv:2209.02852', '10.48550/arXiv.2209.02852', '2023AAS...24111503L', '2022arXiv220902852L', '2022AAS...24034509L', '2022AAS...24043004L', '2021AdSpR..68.2309L', '10.1016/j.asr.2021.04.045', '2021zndo...5029487L', '10.5281/zenodo.5029487', '2021Icar..35613633L', 'arXiv:1912.02333', '2019arXiv191202333L', '10.1016/j.icarus.2020.113633', '10.48550/arXiv.1912.02333', '2019AAS...23325512L', '2018AAS...23114403L', '2017DPS....4921502L', '2015ASPC..497..311L', '2011ASPC..445..629L', '2010AAS...21541716L', '2010BAAS...42..273L', '10.1016/j.asr.2009.04.005', '2009AdSpR..44..184L', '2009BAAS...41..207L', '2009AAS...21340814L', '2009BAAS...41..509L', '2009AAS...21323603L', '2007AAS...21110421L', '2007BAAS...39..927L', '2007ASPC..378..311L', '2006AAS...20910101L', '2006BAAS...38.1045L', '2006AJ....132..489L', '10.1086/505134', '10.1017/S1743921306003681', '2006IAUS..234..449L', '2005AAS...20710406L', '2005BAAS...37Q1335L', '2005JChPh.122n4302L', '10.1063/1.1869986', '2004BAAS...36.1358L', '2004AAS...205.1209L', '2004smra.conf.....L', '2004AJ....127..501L', '10.1086/381136', '2003BAAS...35R1358L', '2003AAS...203.9311L', '2003BAAS...35..746L', '2003AAS...202.3219L', '2003IAUS..209...71L']","[('star', 46), ('ir', 43), ('maser', 39), ('mass', 32), ('shell', 29), ('color', 28), ('ice', 28), ('model', 27), ('pluto', 27), ('mhz', 27)]","[(('ir', 'star'), 32), (('mhz', 'maser'), 21), (('dm', 'dt'), 16), (('mass', 'loss'), 14), (('nitrogen', 'ice'), 10), (('detached', 'shell'), 10), (('volatile', 'ice'), 9), (('lesson', 'plan'), 8), (('distribution', 'nitrogen'), 8), (('debris', 'disk'), 7)]","[(('spectral', 'energy', 'distribution'), 4), (('high', 'contrast', 'imaging'), 4), (('space', 'time', 'covariance'), 4), (('distribution', 'nitrogen', 'ice'), 4), (('global', 'energy', 'balance'), 4), (('colors', 'ir', 'stars'), 4), (('mass', 'loss', 'rate'), 4), (('hd', 'debris', 'disk'), 3), (('radiative', 'transfer', 'models'), 3), (('ability', 'engage', 'research'), 3)]",Dirty

We target $11$ groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to depths over an order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3 spectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the satellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of $\sim 10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental quenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall histories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we estimate environmental quenching timescales ($\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}$) for the observed group population. At high stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{10.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}} = 2.4\substack{+0.2 \\ -0.2}$ Gyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower stellar masses (${M}_{\star}=10^{9.5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$), we find that $\tau_{\mathrm{quench}}=3.1\substack{+0.5 \\ -0.4}$ Gyr, which is shorter than prior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are consistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas envelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the evolution in the quenching timescale between $0 \lt z \lt 1$ aligns with the evolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas depletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in groups since $z\sim1$ could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or a decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift., It has long been shown that environment plays a major role in galaxy evolution, with galaxies in dense regions of the cosmos more likely to have their star formation suppressed or quenched relative to their more isolated counterparts. Despite this remarkable discovery, our current understanding of the physical processes responsible for the suppression (or quenching) of star formation remains woefully incomplete. This is especially true for galaxies that are members of galaxy groups and clusters - i.e. satellite galaxies - given that our best cosmological models struggle to reproduce key observations, such as the satellite quenched fraction. This work aims to advance our knowledge of environmental quenching in the regimes that are poorly understood, focusing on the quenching of low-mass dwarf satellite galaxies and satellite populations at intermediate and high redshifts. Observational studies of low-mass satellite quenching have been limited by their inability to robustly characterize the local environment and star-formation activity of faint systems. This work overcomes these limitations by combining supervised machine learning and statistical background subtraction techniques to constrain the satellite quenched fraction of group populations down to a satellite stellar mass limit of ~10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB>. This approach successfully reproduces the established quenched fraction trends at high-masses while finding that the efficiency of quenching increases towards low-masses. The importance of investigating intermediate and high redshift is that the vast majority of environmental quenching studies are limited to the very local Universe (z ≤ 0.1). This work addresses this shortcoming by combining multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations of massive clusters at z~1 with the infall histories of analogs from N-body simulations to model satellite quenching at this poorly studied epoch. The quenching timescales derived from this study indicate that starvation - the slow depletion of cold gas in the absence of cosmological accretion after a satellite becomes a member of a more massive host - is the dominant driver of environmental quenching at this epoch. However, this study lends support to the scenario where ram-pressure stripping potentially acts as a secondary quenching mechanism in massive clusters at this epoch. The significance of this work is that it places valuable constraints on the dominant mechanisms responsible for quenching galaxies in two poorly understood regimes, namely, at low satellite stellar masses and beyond the local Universe., We explore models of massive (&gt;10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) satellite quenching in massive clusters at z ≳ 1 using an MCMC framework, focusing on two primary parameters: R<SUB>quench</SUB> (the host-centric radius at which quenching begins) and τ<SUB>quench</SUB> (the time-scale upon which a satellite quenches after crossing R<SUB>quench</SUB>). Our MCMC analysis shows two local maxima in the 1D posterior probability distribution of R<SUB>quench</SUB> at approximately 0.25 and 1.0 R<SUB>200</SUB>. Analysing four distinct solutions in the τ<SUB>quench</SUB>-R<SUB>quench</SUB> parameter space, nearly all of which yield quiescent fractions consistent with observational data from the GOGREEN survey, we investigate whether these solutions represent distinct quenching pathways and find that they can be separated between 'starvation' and 'core quenching' scenarios. The starvation pathway is characterized by quenching time-scales that are roughly consistent with the total cold gas (H<SUB>2</SUB> + H I) depletion time-scale at intermediate z, while core quenching is characterized by satellites with relatively high line-of-sight velocities that quench on short time-scales (~0.25 Gyr) after reaching the inner region of the cluster (&lt;0.30 R<SUB>200</SUB>). Lastly, we break the degeneracy between these solutions by comparing the observed properties of transition galaxies from the GOGREEN survey. We conclude that only the 'starvation' pathway is consistent with the projected phase-space distribution and relative abundance of transition galaxies at z ~ 1. However, we acknowledge that ram pressure might contribute as a secondary quenching mechanism., Observations of clusters at z ~ 1 have found that the galaxies that reside in these extremely dense environments — i.e. satellite galaxies — have preferentially lower star formation rates relative to their similar mass counterparts in the less dense field. The work presented in talk seeks to answer the question: ""what physical mechanism is responsible for suppressing the star formation (i.e. 'quenching') of satellite galaxies in massive clusters at z ~ 1?"" Our approach involves combining multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of cluster populations from the GCLASS and GOGREEN surveys at z ~ 1 with orbital histories of analogous populations from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to isolate the quenching timescale necessary to reproduce the observed satellite quenched fraction trends. The results from this environmental quenching model are compared with coeval observations — e.g. the total cold gas depletion timescale and fraction of post-starburst galaxies — to further isolate the most likely driver of environmental quenching at this epoch., We model satellite quenching at z ~ 1 by combining 14 massive (10<SUP>13.8</SUP> &lt; M<SUB>halo</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>15</SUP>) clusters at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 from the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys with accretion histories of 56 redshift-matched analogues from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our fiducial model, which is parametrized by the satellite quenching time-scale (τ<SUB>quench</SUB>), accounts for quenching in our simulated satellite population both at the time of infall by using the observed coeval field quenched fraction and after infall by tuning τ<SUB>quench</SUB> to reproduce the observed satellite quenched fraction versus stellar mass trend. This model successfully reproduces the observed satellite quenched fraction as a function of stellar mass (by construction), projected cluster-centric radius, and redshift and is consistent with the observed field and cluster stellar mass functions at z ~ 1. We find that the satellite quenching time-scale is mass dependent, in conflict with some previous studies at low and intermediate redshift. Over the stellar mass range probed (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), we find that the satellite quenching time-scale decreases with increasing satellite stellar mass from ~1.6 Gyr at 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to ~0.6-1 Gyr at 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and is roughly consistent with the total cold gas (HI + H<SUB>2</SUB>) depletion time-scales at intermediate z, suggesting that starvation may be the dominant driver of environmental quenching at z &lt; 2. Finally, while environmental mechanisms are relatively efficient at quenching massive satellites, we find that the majority ($\sim 65{\!-\!}80{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) of ultra-massive satellites (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are quenched prior to infall., Our current understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for suppressing star formation in low-mass satellite galaxies remains incomplete. This is in part driven by the inability of current spectroscopic data sets to robustly characterize the star-formation activity and local environment of faint systems beyond the Local Group. At the same time, there exists an ever growing archival treasure trove from deep photometric surveys that capture these faint systems. The work presented in this talk aims to bridge the observational gap by utilizing the deep photometry in Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in conjunction with statistical background subtraction and supervised learning to ultimately study the suppression of star formation in low-mass satellite galaxies in the local Universe. This statistically-driven approach enables us to push beyond the limits of existing spectroscopic data sets, measuring the satellite quenched fraction down to satellite stellar masses of ~10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in group environments (M<SUB>halo</SUB>=10<SUP>13-14</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) while successfully reproducing existing measurements based on spectroscopic observations., The field of dark matter detection is a highly visible and highly competitive one. In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result, direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO, SBC, SENSEI, SuperCDMS, and XENON collaborations, and these collaborations provided input to the recommendations laid out here. Wide-spread adoption of these recommendations will make it easier to compare and combine future dark matter results., Observations suggest that satellite quenching plays a major role in the build-up of passive, low-mass galaxies at late cosmic times. Studies of low-mass satellites, however, are limited by the ability to robustly characterize the local environment and star formation activity of faint systems. In an effort to overcome the limitations of existing data sets, we utilize deep photometry in Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in conjunction with a neural network classification scheme, to study the suppression of star formation in low-mass satellite galaxies in the local Universe. Using a statistically driven approach, we are able to push beyond the limits of existing spectroscopic data sets, measuring the satellite quenched fraction down to satellite stellar masses of ~10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in group environments (M<SUB>halo</SUB> = 10<SUP>13-14</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). At high satellite stellar masses (≳10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), our analysis successfully reproduces existing measurements of the quenched fraction based on spectroscopic samples. Pushing to lower masses, we find that the fraction of passive satellites increases, potentially signalling a change in the dominant quenching mechanism at M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Similar to the results of previous studies of the Local Group, this increase in the quenched fraction at low satellite masses may correspond to an increase in the efficacy of ram-pressure stripping as a quenching mechanism in groups., The European Spallation Source (ESS), presently well on its way to completion, will soon provide the most intense neutron beams for multi-disciplinary science. Fortuitously, it will also generate the largest pulsed neutrino flux suitable for the detection of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEνNS), a process recently measured for the first time at ORNL's Spallation Neutron Source. We describe innovative detector technologies maximally able to profit from the order-of-magnitude increase in neutrino flux provided by the ESS, along with their sensitivity to a rich particle physics phenomenology accessible through high-statistics, precision CEνNS measurements., , A 30-g xenon bubble chamber, operated at Northwestern University in June and November 2016, has for the first time observed simultaneous bubble nucleation and scintillation by nuclear recoils in a superheated liquid. This chamber is instrumented with a CCD camera for near-IR bubble imaging, a solar-blind photomultiplier tube to detect 175-nm xenon scintillation light, and a piezoelectric acoustic transducer to detect the ultrasonic emission from a growing bubble. The time of nucleation determined from the acoustic signal is used to correlate specific scintillation pulses with bubble-nucleating events. We report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic ""Seitz"" thresholds from 4.2 to 15.0 keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to a &lt;mml:mmultiscripts&gt;Cf 252 &lt;/mml:mmultiscripts&gt; neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic threshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is 19 ±6 keV (1 σ uncertainty). This is consistent with the observed scintillation spectrum for bubble-nucleating events. We see no evidence for bubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90% C.L. upper limit of 6.3 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> bubbles per gamma interaction at a 4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold. This indicates stronger gamma discrimination than in CF<SUB>3</SUB> I bubble chambers, supporting the hypothesis that scintillation production suppresses bubble nucleation by electron recoils, while nuclear recoils nucleate bubbles as usual. These measurements establish the noble-liquid bubble chamber as a promising new technology for the detection of weakly interacting massive particle dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.","['arXiv:2412.02766', '10.48550/arXiv.2412.02766', '2024arXiv241202766B', '2024AAS...24344301B', '2023MNRAS.526.3716B', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.09404', 'arXiv:2306.09404', '10.1093/mnras/stad2995', '2023arXiv230609404B', '2023MNRAS.tmp.2875B', '2023AAS...24126001B', '10.1093/mnras/stac2149', '10.48550/arXiv.2207.14302', 'arXiv:2207.14302', '2022arXiv220714302B', '2022MNRAS.tmp.2054B', '2022MNRAS.515.5479B', '2022AAS...24012306B', '10.48550/arXiv.2105.00599', '10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09655-y', 'arXiv:2105.00599', '2021EPJC...81..907B', '2021arXiv210500599B', '2021arXiv210205050B', '2021MNRAS.503.1636B', '2021MNRAS.tmp..550B', 'arXiv:2102.05050', '10.1093/mnras/stab523', '10.48550/arXiv.2102.05050', '2019arXiv191100762B', '10.48550/arXiv.1911.00762', '10.1007/JHEP02(2020)123', 'arXiv:1911.00762', '2020JHEP...02..123B', '2019ICRC...36..507B', '2019PoS...358..507B', '2017arXiv170208861B', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.231301', '10.48550/arXiv.1702.08861', '2017PhRvL.118w1301B', 'arXiv:1702.08861']","[('satellite', 42), ('quenching', 39), ('mass', 26), ('galaxy', 17), ('fraction', 16), ('time', 16), ('group', 14), ('bubble', 14), ('stellar', 13), ('quenched', 13)]","[(('stellar', 'mass'), 13), (('quenched', 'fraction'), 11), (('satellite', 'quenching'), 10), (('star', 'formation'), 10), (('environmental', 'quenching'), 8), (('satellite', 'quenched'), 8), (('low', 'mass'), 8), (('time', 'scale'), 8), (('dark', 'matter'), 8), (('satellite', 'galaxy'), 7)]","[(('satellite', 'quenched', 'fraction'), 7), (('total', 'cold', 'gas'), 4), (('cold', 'gas', 'depletion'), 4), (('low', 'mass', 'satellite'), 4), (('satellite', 'stellar', 'masses'), 4), (('tau', 'mathrm', 'quench'), 3), (('gas', 'depletion', 'time'), 3), (('star', 'formation', 'activity'), 3), (('driver', 'environmental', 'quenching'), 3), (('observed', 'satellite', 'quenched'), 3)]",Dirty

These simulations capture the complexities of galaxy evolution within the first ~300 Myr by modeling individual stars and their feedback processes. By incorporating chemical yields from individual stars, AEOS generates galaxies with diverse stellar chemical abundances, linking them to hierarchical galaxy formation and early nucleosynthetic events. These simulations underscore the importance of chemical abundance patterns in ancient stars as vital probes of early nucleosynthesis, star formation histories, and galaxy formation. We examine the metallicity floors of various elements resulting from Pop III enrichment, providing best-fit values for eight different metals (e.g., [O/H] = -4.0) to guide simulations without Pop III models. Additionally, we identify galaxies that begin star formation with Pop II after external enrichment and investigate the frequency of CEMP stars at varying metallicities. The AEOS simulations offer detailed insights into the relationship between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment. Future work will extend these simulations to later epochs to interpret the diverse stellar populations of the Milky Way and its satellites., The first galaxies formed 200-300 million years after the Big Bang. The smallest of these early galaxies, the ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), were quenched by reionization, so those that survived until now are composed of ancient stars from 13 billion years ago. Stars from these tiny galaxies thus are relics from the era of the first stars and galaxies, preserving clean signatures of early chemical enrichment. Currently, though, simulations are unable to explain observed stellar chemical abundances in these galaxies. To fully utilize the available chemical abundance data on stars from UFDs, we are running cosmological simulations of early dwarf galaxy formation with individual stars, detailed chemical yields, and highly-resolved metal mixing. This allows us to explore complex galaxy formation processes including source-dependent metal mixing, hierarchical galaxy merging, bursty star formation, and variations across different galaxies to learn how early galaxies evolved., In the first several hundred million years after the Big Bang, the first stars and galaxies transformed the Universe. These ancient systems launched the creation of every galaxy we see today, including the Milky Way. Ever since, for the last 13 billion years, the Milky Way has grown through galaxy mergers. Several of these mergers were with other similarly-sized galaxies and possibly a hundred of these mergers were with small dwarf galaxies. The smallest dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way, the ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), are relics of the first galaxies in the Universe and provide important insight into early galaxy formation and chemical enrichment. Currently, though, accreted UFDs are poorly understood and we lack ways to identify stars that accreted from UFDs. By utilizing a simulation suite of 35 Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, I find that chemical tagging with r-process elements and clustering in kinematic phase space can help us identify stars that accreted together from these dwarf galaxies. Kinematic clustering only identifies recently accreted UFDs (z ≲ 0.5), so we recommend chemical tagging as the more robust method to identify these stars. I also present an analytic model of collapsar enrichment that can self-consistently explain the observed scatter in r-process chemical elements of old stars. I am expanding on these studies with highly-resolved hydrodynamic simulations of the earliest dwarf galaxies, the Aeos simulations. The methodology and initial results for these simulations are also presented., The motions and chemical composition of the stars currently present in the extended outskirts (the stellar halo) of a galaxy preserve a record of the galaxy's formation history. While most of the stars in the center and disk of a galaxy formed in situ, many of the stars in the stellar halo originated in the many small galaxies that the central host galaxy accreted over billions of years. Currently, though, we lack ways to identify which halo stars originated in which dwarf galaxies or even reliably identify which stars were accreted. By utilizing the Caterpillar simulation suite, a suite of 32 Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, we find that stars with strong enrichment of certain chemical elements (e.g., r-process elements) may have preferentially formed in the smallest dwarf galaxies that merged into the Milky Way. We also quantify how well astronomers can kinematically identify stars that accreted together from these dwarf galaxies and investigate the astrophysical sites of r-process element production. Currently, we are expanding on this work with more detailed simulations of dwarf galaxies and how r-process elements mix into interstellar gas., The Milky Way has accreted many ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), and stars from these galaxies can be found throughout our Galaxy today. Studying these stars provides insight into galaxy formation and early chemical enrichment, but identifying them is difficult. Clustering stellar dynamics in 4D phase space (E, L <SUB> z </SUB>, J <SUB> r </SUB>, J <SUB> z </SUB>) is one method of identifying accreted structure that is currently being utilized in the search for accreted UFDs. We produce 32 simulated stellar halos using particle tagging with the Caterpillar simulation suite and thoroughly test the abilities of different clustering algorithms to recover tidally disrupted UFD remnants. We perform over 10,000 clustering runs, testing seven clustering algorithms, roughly twenty hyperparameter choices per algorithm, and six different types of data sets each with up to 32 simulated samples. Of the seven algorithms, HDBSCAN most consistently balances UFD recovery rates and cluster realness rates. We find that, even in highly idealized cases, the vast majority of clusters found by clustering algorithms do not correspond to real accreted UFD remnants and we can generally only recover 6% of UFDs remnants at best. These results focus exclusively on groups of stars from UFDs, which have weak dynamic signatures compared to the background of other stars. The recoverable UFD remnants are those that accreted recently, z <SUB>accretion</SUB> ≲ 0.5. Based on these results, we make recommendations to help guide the search for dynamically linked clusters of UFD stars in observational data. We find that real clusters generally have higher median energy and J <SUB> r </SUB>, providing a way to help identify real versus fake clusters. We also recommend incorporating chemical tagging as a way to improve clustering results., It is unclear if neutron star mergers can explain the observed r-process abundances of metal-poor stars. Collapsars, defined here as rotating massive stars whose collapse results in a rapidly accreting disk around a black hole that can launch jets, are a promising alternative. We find that we can produce a self-consistent model in which a population of collapsars with stochastic europium yields synthesizes all of the r-process material in metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; - 2.5) stars. Our model reproduces the observed scatter and evolution of scatter of [Eu/Fe] abundances. We find that if collapsars are the dominant r-process site for metal-poor stars, r-process synthesis may be linked to supernovae that produce long γ-ray bursts. Our results also allow for the possibility that core-collapse supernovae beyond those that launch γ-ray bursts also produce r-process material (e.g., potentially a subset of Type Ic-BL supernovae). Furthermore, we identify collapsar jet properties (isotropic energy, engine luminosity, or engine time) that may trace r-process yield and verify that the amount of r-process yield produced per collapsar in our model ( ~ 0.07M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) is consistent with other independent estimates. In the future, achieving 0.05 dex precision on distribution scatter or a reliable selection function would further constrain our probe of r-process production. Our model would also hold for another prompt r-process site with a power-law yield, and work is needed to determine if, for example, fast-merging neutron stars can also explain abundance scatter., The stars currently present in the outskirts of the Milky Way, the ""stellar halo"", preserve a record of the Galaxy's formation history. Galaxies form primarily through mergers, by absorbing smaller galaxies to grow larger. While most of the stars in the center and disk of a galaxy are formed in situ, the stars in the stellar halo primarily originated from the many small galaxies that the central host galaxy accreted over billions of years. Currently, though, we lack ways to identify which halo stars originated in which dwarf galaxies or even reliably identify which stars were accreted. Selecting stars with specific chemical signatures may provide a way forward. Using high-resolution cosmological simulations from the Caterpillar suite, we find that highly r-process-enhanced metal-poor halo stars, r-II stars, may have largely originated in early dwarf galaxies that merged to form the Milky Way. The r-II halo stars we observe today could thus play a key role in understanding the smallest building blocks of the Milky Way. This work is a first step towards creating a detailed theoretical model of stellar halo evolution. With such a model, we will be able to interpret the massive amounts of stellar halo data from Gaia, APOGEE, and other large surveys to obtain a deep understanding of how our galaxy, and the galaxies around us, formed., The Milky Way's stellar halo preserves a fossil record of smaller dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way throughout its formation history. Currently, though, we lack reliable ways to identify which halo stars originated in which dwarf galaxies or even which stars were definitively accreted. Selecting stars with specific chemical signatures may provide a way forward. We investigate this theoretically and observationally for stars with r-process nucleosynthesis signatures. Theoretically, we combine high-resolution cosmological simulations with an empirically-motivated treatment of r-process enhancement. We find that around half of highly r-process-enhanced metal-poor halo stars may have originated in early ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that merged into the Milky Way during its formation. Observationally, we use Gaia DR2 to compare the kinematics of highly r-process-enhanced halo stars with those of normal halo stars. R-process-enhanced stars have higher galactocentric velocities than normal halo stars, suggesting an accretion origin. If r-process-enhanced stars largely originated in accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, halo stars we observe today could play a key role in understanding the smallest building blocks of the Milky Way via this novel approach of chemical tagging, The highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) metal-poor halo stars we observe today could play a key role in understanding early ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), the smallest building blocks of the Milky Way. If a significant fraction of metal-poor r-II halo stars originated in the UFDs that merged to help form the Milky Way, observations of r-II stars could help us study these now-destroyed systems and probe the formation history of our Galaxy. To conduct our initial investigation into this possible connection, we use high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Caterpillar suite in combination with a simple, empirically motivated treatment of r-process enrichment. We determine the fraction of metal-poor halo stars that could have formed from highly r-process-enhanced gas in now-destroyed low-mass UFDs, the simulated r-II fraction, and compare it to the “as observed” r-II fraction. We find that the simulated fraction, f <SUB>r-II,sim</SUB> ∼ 1%-2%, can account for around half of the “as observed” fraction, f <SUB>r-II,obs</SUB> ∼ 2%-4%. The “as observed” fraction likely overrepresents the fraction of r-II stars due to incomplete sampling, though, meaning f <SUB>r-II,sim</SUB> likely accounts for more than half of the true f <SUB>r-II,obs</SUB>. Further considering some parameter variations and scatter between individual simulations, the simulated fraction can account for around 20%-80% of the “as observed” fraction., We present phase-resolved optical spectra of the low-mass X-ray binary system V801 Ara. The spectra, obtained in 2014 with Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph on the Magellan/Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, cover the full binary orbit of 3.8 h. They contain strong emission features allowing us to map the emission of H α, H β, He II λ4686, and the Bowen blend at λ4640. The radial velocity curves of the Bowen blend shows significantly stronger modulation at the orbital period than H α as expected for the former originating on the secondary with the latter consistent with emission dominated by the disc. Our tomograms of H α and H β are the most detailed studies of these lines for V801 to date and they clearly detect the accretion disc. The H β emission extends to higher velocities than H α, suggesting emission from closer to the neutron star and differentiating temperature variance in the accretion disc for the first time. The centre of the accretion disc appears offset from the centre-of-mass of the neutron star as has been seen in several other X-ray binaries. This is often interpreted to imply disc eccentricity. Our tomograms do not show strong evidence for a hotspot at the point where the accretion stream hits the disc. This could imply a reduced accretion rate or could be due to the spot being drowned out by bright accretion flow around it. There is enhanced emission further along the disc, however, which implies gas stream interaction downstream of the hotspot., We present spectroscopic observations of two X-ray binary systems, V801 Ara and Cyg X-3. We observed V801 Ara in the optical in 2014 with IMACS on the Magellan/Baade telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and Cyg X-3 in the near-infrared in 2015 with GNIRS on the Gemini North telescope. Both spectra contain strong emission features that are suitable for tomography, allowing us to map the systems in velocity space. Our tomograms show continuous emission of H_alpha and H_beta from V801 Ara’s accretion disk. The center of the accretion disk does not coincide with the neutron star’s estimated center of mass (estimated using K1 = 102 km s-1 and K2 = 360 km s-1 from Casares et al. 2006, MNRAS, 373, 1235), possibly indicating eccentricity in the disk. The tomograms also do not show a hot spot where the accretion stream hits the disk, implying a low accretion rate. Due to insufficient orbital phase coverage in our GNIRS observations, we are unable to produce significant tomograms of Cyg X-3., We observed near-Earth asteroid 2000 RS11 with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars during a 0.035 au approach in March 2014, obtaining delay-Doppler images between March 13 and March 17. The finest-resolution images have range resolution of 7.5 m/pixel and show that RS11 is a contact binary with complex topography. We used the SHAPE software package (Magri et al., Icarus 186, 156-160 2007) to create a physical model of RS11 and its spin state from these delay-Doppler images.The rotation period of RS11 is well constrained from optical lightcurves, P = 4.444 ± 0.001 h (Warner et al., Minor Planet Bulletin 41, 160; 2014 and Benishek, Minor Planet Bulletin 41, 257; 2014). We found two possible pole directions and corresponding shape models, mirror images of one another, which provide equally good fits to the radar data. RS11’s pole direction is either (λ , β) = (155°, 30°) ± 10° or (335°, -30°) ± 10° in J2000 ecliptic coordinates. The most likely pole directions of RS11 are not aligned with the heliocentric orbit normal and instead have an obliquity within 10° of 56° or 124°.Our best-fit shape models are 1400-vertex polyhedra comprising two lobes in contact. The lengths of RS11’s principal axes are 698 ± 71 m, 578 ± 59 m, and 758 ± 77 m. RS11 has a volume of 0.086 ± 0.026 km^3. The long axis of RS11’s larger lobe is 751 ± 77 m and the long axis of the smaller lobe is 398 ± 41 m; the volume ratio between these lobes is roughly 2.7 ± 10%. Spectral data informs us that RS11 is an S-class object (Lazzarin et al., Icarus 169, 379; 2004).RS11's shape is unusual compared with those of other contact binary NEAs imaged by radar. Its larger lobe is flattened. Additionally, while the neck between the smaller and larger lobes of most contact binaries is located near the larger lobe's longest principal axis (such as in the cases of 25143 Itokawa and 4179 Toutatis), RS11's neck is near its larger lobe's shortest principal axis. RS11 is the first asteroid of this type for which we have a shape model.","['10.48550/arXiv.2410.16366', '2024arXiv241016366B', 'arXiv:2410.16366', '2024AAS...24333806B', '2023PhDT........29B', '2023AAS...24142002B', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac85b9', 'arXiv:2206.07057', '2022ApJ...937...14B', '2022arXiv220607057B', '10.48550/arXiv.2206.07057', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.15837', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac00b2', 'arXiv:2010.15837', '2021ApJ...915...81B', '2020arXiv201015837B', '2020AAS...23526003B', '2020IAUS..353...71B', '10.1017/S1743921319008755', '10.3847/1538-4357/aafafb', '2018arXiv180905539B', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.05539', 'arXiv:1809.05539', '2019ApJ...871..247B', '2017arXiv171100947B', '10.1093/mnras/sty1429', '2018MNRAS.tmp.1370B', '10.48550/arXiv.1711.00947', 'arXiv:1711.00947', '2018MNRAS.478.4894B', '2017AAS...22934403B', '2015DPS....4721303B']","[('star', 66), ('galaxy', 58), ('process', 26), ('halo', 21), ('chemical', 20), ('simulation', 19), ('dwarf', 19), ('milky', 18), ('accreted', 17), ('formation', 16)]","[(('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 17), (('halo', 'star'), 13), (('galaxy', 'formation'), 9), (('stellar', 'halo'), 8), (('metal', 'poor'), 8), (('process', 'enhanced'), 7), (('ultra', 'faint'), 6), (('faint', 'dwarf'), 6), (('identify', 'star'), 6), (('cosmological', 'simulation'), 5)]","[(('identify', 'stars', 'accreted'), 5), (('halo', 'stars', 'originated'), 5), (('highly', 'process', 'enhanced'), 5), (('high', 'resolution', 'cosmological'), 4), (('resolution', 'cosmological', 'simulations'), 4), (('dwarf', 'galaxies', 'merged'), 4), (('ultra', 'faint', 'dwarf'), 4), (('faint', 'dwarf', 'galaxies'), 4), (('metal', 'poor', 'halo'), 4), (('poor', 'halo', 'stars'), 4)]",Dirty

Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power-law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for nondetections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances &lt;50 Mpc, radio data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey at &lt;50 Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at z &lt; 0.055. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least 90% at stellar masses of M <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and at least 39% at M <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (95% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low-luminosity end (L <SUB>bol</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>‑1</SUP>) of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity functions at z = 0. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work., We study the black hole mass–host galaxy stellar mass relation, M <SUB>BH</SUB>–M <SUB>*</SUB>, of a sample of z &lt; 4 optically variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad-line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to z ∼ 1. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that z ∼ 0.5–4 variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–M <SUB>*</SUB> relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is in agreement with most previous studies of the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–M <SUB>*</SUB> relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts to anchor this scaling relation. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem., We present a phenomenological forward Monte Carlo model for forecasting the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies observable via their optical variability. Our model accounts for expected changes in the spectral energy distribution of AGNs in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mass range and uses observational constraints on optical variability as a function of black hole (BH) mass to generate mock light curves. Adopting several different models for the BH occupation function, including one for off-nuclear IMBHs, we quantify differences in the predicted local AGN mass and luminosity functions in dwarf galaxies. As a result, we are able to model the fraction of variable AGNs as a function of important galaxy host properties, such as host galaxy stellar mass, in the presence of selection effects. We find that our adopted occupation fractions for the 'heavy' and 'light' initial BH seeding scenarios can be distinguished with variability at the 2-3σ level for galaxy host stellar masses below ∼10<SUP>8</SUP>M⊙ with data from the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We also demonstrate the prevalence of a selection bias whereby recovered IMBH masses fall, on average, above the predicted value from the local host galaxy-BH mass scaling relation with the strength of this bias dependent on the survey sensitivity. Our methodology can be used more broadly to calibrate AGN demographic studies in synoptic surveys. Finally, we show that a targeted ∼ hourly cadence program over a few nights with the Rubin Observatory can provide strong constraints on IMBH masses given their expected rapid variability time-scales., Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the principal extragalactic γ-ray sources. Fermi-detected high-redshift (z &gt; 3) blazars are jetted AGNs thought to be powered by massive, rapidly spinning supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe (&lt;2 Gyr). They provide a laboratory to study early black hole (BH) growth and super-Eddington accretion - possibly responsible for the more rapid formation of jetted BHs. However, previous virial BH masses of z &gt; 3 blazars were based on C IV λ1549 in the observed optical, but C IV λ1549 is known to be biased by strong outflows. We present new Gemini/GNIRS near-infrared spectroscopy for a sample of nine z &gt; 3 Fermi γ-ray blazars with available multiwavelength observations that maximally sample the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We estimate virial BH masses based on the better calibrated broad H β and/or Mg II λ2800. We compare the new virial BH masses against independent mass estimates from SED modelling. Our work represents the first step in campaigning for more robust virial BH masses and Eddington ratios for high-redshift Fermi blazars. Our new results confirm that high-redshift Fermi blazars indeed host overly massive SMBHs as suggested by previous work, which may pose a theoretical challenge for models of the rapid early growth of jetted SMBHs., When the time difference quotients, or variational slopes, of quasar light curves are plotted against their absolute magnitudes, there is a tight positive correlation of ~0.16 dex in the variational slope direction or ~0.5 dex in the absolute magnitude direction. This finding resulted in suggestions that a variational slope-luminosity relation could be used as a distance indicator. However, I show that this relation can be explained almost entirely from self-correlation with luminosity. After properly accounting for the self-correlation component, the relation has a true scatter of ~1.5 dex in luminosity, consistent with established correlations for quasar variability amplitudes. Given this large scatter, correlation with variational slope or variability amplitude and luminosity is not by itself a suitable distance indicator for quasars., We present a sample of 706, z &lt; 1.5 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from optical photometric variability in three of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields (E2, C3, and X3) over an area of 4.64 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We construct light curves using difference imaging aperture photometry for resolved sources and non-difference imaging PSF photometry for unresolved sources, respectively, and characterize the variability significance. Our DES light curves have a mean cadence of 7 d, a 6-yr baseline, and a single-epoch imaging depth of up to g ~ 24.5. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find 26 out of total 706 variable galaxies are consistent with dwarf galaxies with a reliable stellar mass estimate M<SUB>∗</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>; median photometric redshift of 0.9). We were able to constrain rapid characteristic variability time-scales (~ weeks) using the DES light curves in 15 dwarf AGN candidates (a subset of our variable AGN candidates) at a median photometric redshift of 0.4. This rapid variability is consistent with their low black hole (BH) masses. We confirm the low-mass AGN nature of one source with a high S/N optical spectrum. We publish our catalogue, optical light curves, and supplementary data, such as X-ray properties and optical spectra, when available. We measure a variable AGN fraction versus stellar mass and compare to results from a forward model. This work demonstrates the feasibility of optical variability to identify AGNs with lower BH masses in deep fields, which may be more ""pristine"" analogues of supermassive BH seeds., Stochastic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting supermassive black holes is ubiquitous across wavelengths and timescales. Unlike X-ray variability studies, measurements of high-quality optical light curves and power spectra of AGN are just beginning. A key question is if AGN variability properties can be related to physical properties of the accretion disk. We have demonstrated that the characteristic ""damping"" timescale of AGN optical light curves correlates strongly with the mass of the black hole. Extension to stellar-mass accretion disks suggests the interpretation may be universal, and could be a powerful new tool for identifying the elusive population of accreting intermediate-mass black holes. To that end, we have developed a forward model to constrain the local black hole mass function (BHMF) using optical variability with Rubin Observatory. The ultimate goal is that this relic BHMF, when probed in the intermediate-mass black holes regime, will reveal the signature of how supermassive black holes were seeded at high redshifts., We present a phenomenological forward Monte Carlo model for forecasting the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies observable via their optical variability. Our model accounts for expected changes in the spectral energy distribution of AGNs in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mass range and uses observational constraints on optical variability as a function of black hole (BH) mass to generate mock light curves.

We measure a variable AGN fraction versus stellar mass and compare to results from a forward model. This work demonstrates the feasibility of optical variability to identify AGNs with lower BH masses in deep fields, which may be more 'pristine' analogues of supermassive BH seeds., To measure the optical variability of AGNs over a large dynamic range in SMBH mass, we selected our sample to include both distant quasars with decade-long photometric light curves, as well as nearby AGNs targeted for reverberation mapping. <P />(2 data files)., NGC 4395 was observed in Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite (TESS) sector 22 with camera 2, CCD 4 during the month of 2020 March, with an angular resolution of 42"" FWHM and a wide 600-1000nm bandpass. <P />(1 data file)., Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks., We report on continued, ~15-yr long, broad Balmer emission lines in three metal-poor dwarf emission-line galaxies selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy. The persistent luminosity of the broad Balmer emission indicates the galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial black hole masses of ~10<SUP>6.7</SUP>-10<SUP>7.0</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The lack of observed hard X-ray emission and the possibility that the Balmer emission could be due to a long-lived stellar transient motivated additional follow-up spectroscopy. We also identify a previously unreported blueshifted narrow absorption line in the broad H α feature in one of the AGNs, indicating an AGN-driven outflow with hydrogen column densities of order 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also extract light curves from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We detect probable AGN-like variability in three galaxies, further supporting the AGN scenario. This also suggests the AGNs are not strongly obscured. This sample of galaxies are among the most metal-poor that host an AGN (Z = 0.05-0.16 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We speculate they may be analogues to seed black holes which formed in unevolved galaxies at high redshift. Given the rarity of metal-poor AGNs and small sample size available, we investigate prospects for their identification in future spectroscopic and photometric surveys., We present optical light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for the archetypical dwarf active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the nearby galaxy NGC 4395 hosting a ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> supermassive black hole (SMBH). Significant variability is detected on timescales from weeks to hours before reaching the background noise level. The ∼month-long, 30 minute-cadence, high-precision TESS light curve can be well fit by a simple damped random walk (DRW) model, with the damping timescale τ<SUB>DRW</SUB> constrained to be ${2.3}_{-0.7}^{+1.8}$ days (1σ). NGC 4395 lies almost exactly on the extrapolation of the ${\tau }_{\mathrm{DRW}}-{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}$ relation measured for AGNs with BH masses that are more than three orders of magnitude larger. The optical variability periodogram can be well fit by a broken power law with the high-frequency slope (-1.88 ± 0.15) and the characteristic timescale (${\tau }_{\mathrm{br}}\equiv 1/(2\pi {f}_{\mathrm{br}})={1.4}_{-0.5}^{+1.9}$ days) consistent with the DRW model within 1σ. This work demonstrates the power of TESS light curves in identifying low-mass accreting SMBHs with optical variability, and a potential global ${\tau }_{\mathrm{DRW}}-{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}$ relation that can be used to estimate SMBH masses with optical variability measurements., We report on small-amplitude optical variability and recent dissipation of the unusually persistent broad emission lines in the blue compact dwarf galaxy PHL 293B. The galaxy's unusual spectral features (P Cygni-like profiles with ∼800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> blueshifted absorption lines) have resulted in conflicting interpretations of the nature of this source in the literature. However, analysis of new Gemini spectroscopy reveals the broad emission has begun to fade after being persistent for over a decade prior. Precise difference imaging light curves constructed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey reveal small-amplitude optical variability of ∼0.1 mag in the g band offset by 100 ± 21 pc from the brightest pixel of the host. The light curve is well-described by an active galactic nuclei (AGN)-like damped random walk process. However, we conclude that the origin of the optical variability and spectral features of PHL 293B is due to a long-lived stellar transient, likely a Type IIn supernova or nonterminal outburst, mimicking long-term AGN-like variability. This work highlights the challenges of discriminating between scenarios in such extreme environments, relevant to searches for AGNs in dwarf galaxies. This is the second long-lived transient discovered in a blue compact dwarf, after SDSS1133. Our result implies such long-lived stellar transients may be more common in metal-deficient galaxies. Systematic searches for low-level variability in dwarf galaxies will be possible with the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory., We apply a new deep learning technique to detect, classify, and deblend sources in multiband astronomical images. We train and evaluate the performance of an artificial neural network built on the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network image processing framework, a general code for efficient object detection, classification, and instance segmentation. After evaluating the performance of our network against simulated ground truth images for star and galaxy classes, we find a precision of 92 per cent at 80 per cent recall for stars and a precision of 98 per cent at 80 per cent recall for galaxies in a typical field with ∼30 galaxies arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP>. We investigate the deblending capability of our code, and find that clean deblends are handled robustly during object masking, even for significantly blended sources. This technique, or extensions using similar network architectures, may be applied to current and future deep imaging surveys such as Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Our code, ASTRO R-CNN, is publicly available at https://github.com/burke86/astro_rcnn., In this study, we follow the procedure for statistical validation of transiting planet signals using a Bayesian framework (Fressin et al. 2011ApJS..197....5F; Morton &amp; Johnson 2011, J/ApJ/738/170; Torres et al. 2011ApJ...727...24T; Morton 2012ApJ...761....6M). In summary, the validation calculation proceeds by specifying the likelihood that a signal of interest matches what is expected of a bona fide planet (L<SUB>PL</SUB>), an astrophysical false positive (L<SUB>AFP</SUB>), and a systematic false alarm (L<SUB>SFA</SUB>), as well as a prior probability for each scenario (π(PL), π(AFP), π(SFA)). In order to calculate π(PL) and π(SFA), we use a subset of the Kepler targets that are optimized for studying planet occurrence rates for GK dwarfs. See Burke et al. (2015, J/ApJ/809/8), Christiansen (2017ksci.rept...18C), and Burke &amp; Catanzarite (2017ksci.rept...19B) for a full discussion, but in summary, in addition to selecting targets based upon their spectral type, targets are selected for their suitability as relatively quiet, well-behaved targets with well-modeled recoverability of transit signals with the Kepler pipeline. The target selection criteria were based upon studying a database of 1.2x108 transit injection and recovery trials over the Kepler targets in order to reject targets with noise properties making them unsuitable for an accurate quantification of their recovery for transit signals (Burke &amp; Catanzarite 2017ksci.rept...17B). <P />(1 data file)., Recent instrumentation projects have allocated resources to develop codes for simulating astronomical images. Physics-based models are essential for understanding telescope, instrument, and environmental systematics in observations. A deep understanding of these systematics is especially important in the context of weak gravitational lensing, galaxy morphology, and other sensitive measurements. We present an adaptation of a physics-based ab initio image simulator: the photon simulator (PhoSim). We modify PhoSim for use with the near-infrared camera (NIRCam)—the primary imaging instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. This photon Monte Carlo code replicates the observational catalog, telescope and camera optics, detector physics, and readout modes/electronics. Importantly, PhoSim-NIRCam simulates both geometric aberration and diffraction across the field of view. Full field- and wavelength-dependent point spread functions are presented. Simulated images of an extragalactic field are presented. Extensive validation is planned during in-orbit commissioning., Transit and radial velocity searches are two techniques for identifying the nearest extrasolar planets that transit bright stars. Identifying a robust sample of these exoplanets around bright stars for detailed atmospheric characterization using HST and JWST is a major observational undertaking. In this study we describe a framework that answers the question of whether a transit or radial velocity survey is more efficient at finding transiting exoplanets given the same amount of observing time. Within the framework we show that a transit survey's window function can be approximated using the hypergeometric probability distribution which simplifies the design and analysis of a transit survey., In 2011 November, the Q1-Q8 (22 months of data) Kepler pipeline run generated one or more TCEs (threshold crossing events) for ~13400 Kepler targets out of ~191000 targets searched. <P />(1 data file)., We analyze a 19-night photometric search for transiting extrasolar planets in the open cluster NGC 1245 as part of the Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS) project. Using an automated transit search algorithm with quantitative selection criteria, we find six candidates, none of which are bona fide planetary transits. We characterize the survey detection probability via Monte-Carlo injection and recovery of realistic limb-darkened transits for every star in our sample. This allows us to derive upper limits on the fraction of cluster members with close-in Jupiter-radii companions. We also provide realistic expectations for transit discovery rates from future transit surveys similar to STEPSS., Based on our 19 night photometric search for transiting extrasolar planets in the open cluster NGC 1245, we place an upper limit on the fraction of stars in the cluster that harbor close-in Jupiter radii companions. Monte-carlo injection and boxcar recovery of transits in the observed light curves provide the basis for calculating the efficiency for transit detection. This cluster is the first target of the Search for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS) project whose goal is to assess the frequency of close-in extrasolar planets in several open clusters of known metallicity, stellar density, and age in order to constrain the impact of these parameters on the planet formation process., We present first results from the Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS). Our goal is to assess the frequency of close-in extrasolar planets around main-sequence stars in several open clusters. By concentrating on main-sequence stars in clusters of known (and varied) age, metallicity, and stellar density, we will gain insight into how these various properties affect planet formation, migration, and survival. We show preliminary results from our 19 night photometric campaign of the old, solar metallicity cluster NGC 1245. Taking into account the photometric precision, observational window function, transit probability, and total number of cluster members monitored, if no transits are detected, we can rule out &gt; 5% of main-sequence stars in NGC 1245 have Jupiter-sized companions with separations of a &lt; 0.09 AU. If 1% of the stars in the cluster have Jupiter-sized companions evenly distributed in log(a) between 0.03 and 0.3 AU, we expect to find about 2 transits. A preliminary search of our light curve data has revealed a transit with a depth of about 4%. Based on its shape, it is likely to be a grazing binary eclipse rather than a planetary transit, emphasizing the need for high temporal resolution in transit surveys.","['2024arXiv241011177B', '2025ApJ...978...77B', '10.48550/arXiv.2410.11177', 'arXiv:2410.11177', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad94d9', 'arXiv:2402.06882', '2024arXiv240206882B', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad54ca', '2024ApJ...971..140B', '10.48550/arXiv.2402.06882', '2024AAS...24312105B', '2024MNRAS.527.5356B', '2023arXiv230908094B', '10.1093/mnras/stad3592', 'arXiv:2309.08094', '10.48550/arXiv.2309.08094', '2023MNRAS.tmp.3440B', '2023arXiv230607391B', '10.1093/mnras/stad1789', 'arXiv:2306.07391', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.07391', '2023MNRAS.tmp.1724B', '2023MNRAS.523.5535B', '2023AAS...24124402B', '2023AAS...24133605B', '2023MNRAS.518.1880B', '2022arXiv220704092B', '10.1093/mnras/stac2478', '10.48550/arXiv.2207.04092', 'arXiv:2207.04092', '2022MNRAS.tmp.2505B', '2022MNRAS.tmp.2152B', '2022MNRAS.516.2736B', 'arXiv:2111.03079', '2021arXiv211103079B', '10.48550/arXiv.2111.03079', '10.1093/mnras/stac2262', '2022yCatp021037301B', '2021yCat..18990136B', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18990136', 'arXiv:2108.05389', '2021arXiv210805389B', '10.48550/arXiv.2108.05389', '2021Sci...373..789B', '10.1126/science.abg9933', '10.48550/arXiv.2011.10053', '2021MNRAS.504..543B', '10.1093/mnras/stab912', '2020arXiv201110053B', '2021MNRAS.tmp..936B', 'arXiv:2011.10053', '10.48550/arXiv.2005.04491', 'arXiv:2005.04491', '2020ApJ...899..136B', '2020arXiv200504491B', '10.3847/1538-4357/aba3ce', '10.3847/2041-8213/ab88de', '10.48550/arXiv.2002.12369', 'arXiv:2002.12369', '2020ApJ...894L...5B', '2020arXiv200212369B', 'arXiv:1908.02748', '2019arXiv190802748B', '2019MNRAS.490.3952B', '2019MNRAS.tmp.2430B', '10.1093/mnras/stz2845', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.02748', '2019yCat..51570143B', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51570143', '2019JATIS...5c8002B', '2019arXiv190506461B', 'arXiv:1905.06461', '10.1117/1.JATIS.5.3.038002', '10.48550/arXiv.1905.06461', '2014hwat.confE...9B', '2014yCat..22100019B', '10.26093/cds/vizier.22100019', '2005BAAS...37.1499B', '2005AAS...20720102B', '2004BAAS...36.1354B', '2004AAS...205.1116B', '2002astro.ph..8305B', 'arXiv:astro-ph/0208305', '10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0208305', '2003ASPC..294..379B']","[('mass', 56), ('variability', 43), ('galaxy', 41), ('black', 32), ('hole', 32), ('optical', 30), ('agn', 27), ('survey', 26), ('bh', 26), ('agns', 25)]","[(('black', 'hole'), 32), (('light', 'curve'), 22), (('optical', 'variability'), 16), (('stellar', 'mass'), 13), (('active', 'galactic'), 13), (('galactic', 'nucleus'), 13), (('bh', 'mass'), 13), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 11), (('time', 'scale'), 9), (('extrasolar', 'planet'), 8)]","[(('active', 'galactic', 'nuclei'), 11), (('galactic', 'nuclei', 'agns'), 7), (('intermediate', 'mass', 'black'), 6), (('black', 'hole', 'bh'), 5), (('supermassive', 'black', 'holes'), 5), (('optical', 'light', 'curves'), 5), (('transiting', 'extrasolar', 'planets'), 5), (('black', 'hole', 'mass'), 4), (('host', 'galaxy', 'stellar'), 4), (('mass', 'black', 'hole'), 4)]",Dirty

We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift Universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument's sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z ≈ 0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03–35.12 h Mpc<SUP>‑1</SUP> with 0.1 h Mpc<SUP>‑1</SUP> resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping., Code that calculates the sensitivity of interferometric arrays for intensity mapping applications. For more information, see Byrne et al. 2024 ""21 cm Intensity Mapping with the DSA-2000"" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00896)., The highly redshifted 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen has the potential to reveal the temperature, density, and ionization fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Cosmic Dawn, when the first stars and galaxies illuminated the universe. The upgraded Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA) is sensitive to this cosmological signal at redshifts z ≈ 16-100. We describe preliminary results toward deep limits on the 21 cm power spectrum from the Cosmic Dawn using the upgraded OVRO-LWA Stage III. We discuss the impact on the array upgrade on 21 cm cosmology systematics, including reduction of signal crosstalk and reflections, and present a data analysis strategy that focuses on precision calibration and power spectrum estimation with an imaging-style analysis. Calibration is performed with DWCal, a direction-independent interferometric calibration technique that reduces spectral calibration error and is robust to sky model error. We use the FHD/εppsilon pipeline for imaging and power spectrum estimation. A fully polarized simulated beam model is used to capture direction-dependent effects in calibration and imaging., The DSA-2000 is a forthcoming 2000-dish radio array to be built in Nevada. We explore the projected capability of the DSA-2000 to perform line intensity mapping of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. Line intensity mapping is a promising probe of the universe's large-scale structure. It allows for tomographic mapping of emission lines without necessitating resolving individual sources. In particular, 21 cm intensity mapping will provide measurement of the universe's large-scale structure with excellent redshift resolution and without bias toward high-mass galaxies, making it a complementary probe to cosmology measurements from galaxy surveys. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at redshifts of z=0-1 and across a wide range of power spectrum modes. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we discuss the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping., , , This report includes classifications of 12 Type Ia's, 4 Type II's and a Type IIb. A transient was seen at the position of SN2023suz in 2019 (AT2019sqq), however this is probably unrelated to the Type Ia SN which we classify here., , Intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs) are a class of observed transient posited to arise from the production of an electron-capture supernova from a super-asymptotic giant branch star within a dusty cocoon. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of narrow Na I D absorption as a means of probing the circumstellar environment of these events. We find a wide diversity of evolution in ILRTs in terms of line strength, time-scale, and shape. We present a simple toy model designed to predict this evolution as arising from ejecta from a central supernova passing through a circumstellar environment wherein Na II is recombining to Na I over time. We find that while our toy model can qualitatively explain the evolution of a number of ILRTs, the majority of our sample undergoes evolution more complex than predicted. The success of using the Na I D doublet as a diagnostic tool for studying circumstellar material will rely on the availability of regular high-resolution spectral observations of multiple ILRTs, and more detailed spectral modelling will be required to produce models capable of explaining the diverse range of behaviours exhibited by ILRTs. In addition, the strength of the Na I D absorption feature has been used as a means of estimating the extinction of sources, and we suggest that the variability visible in ILRTs would prevent such methods from being used for this class of transient, and any others showing evidence of variability., Measuring the power spectrum of 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen would probe large-scale structure across a large redshift range, providing insight into cosmic evolution through the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, Epoch of Reionization, and into the modern universe. These measurements would constrain early galaxy formation, Dark Matter interactions, and the universe's expansion history. The promise of 21 cm cosmology has driven development of several radio interferometric experiments in recent years, but none have successfully measured the emission's power spectrum. These experiments have the needed sensitivity but are limited by their ability to control measurement systematics that mix the 21 cm signal with the bright intervening foreground emission. We explore the capacity of next-generation 21 cm instruments to overcome systematic error and achieve the promise of 21 cm cosmology. Uncertainties in the instrument response constitute a dominant source of systematics in 21 cm analyses. Precision signal reconstruction involves unraveling the instrument's response to the incident signal, but this requires exquisite understanding of the instrument. Analyses must know to great accuracy both the complex, direction-independent antenna gains, typically constrained in calibration, and the direction-dependent beam responses. Any errors in these quantities introduce spectrally variant errors in the reconstructed signal, precluding the spectral filtering required to differentiate the 21 cm signal from the foregrounds. We show that pseudo-random arrays with many antennas—called ""large-N arrays""—have reduced sensitivity to calibration and beam errors. Novel data storage and processing techniques for radio interferometry currently enable larger arrays with up to thousands of fully cross-correlated elements. We explore the impact of these arrays on 21 cm measurements using high-fidelity simulations from which we quantify the relationship between uv plane sampling density and measurement systematics. We explore calibration error, beam modeling error, and mode-mixing for various array configurations, showing that large-N arrays are comparatively resilient to measurement systematics., One of the principal challenges of 21 cm cosmology experiments is overcoming calibration error. Established calibration approaches in the field require an exquisitely accurate sky model, and low-level sky model errors introduce calibration errors that corrupt the cosmological signal. We present a novel calibration approach called delay-weighted calibration, or DWCal, which enables precise calibration even in the presence of sky model error. Sky model error does not affect all power spectrum modes equally, and DWCal fits calibration solutions preferentially from error-free modes. We apply this technique to simulated data, showing that it substantially reduces calibration error in the presence of realistic levels of sky model error and can improve 21 cm power spectrum sensitivity by approximately 2 orders of magnitude., One of the principal challenges of 21 cm cosmology experiments is overcoming calibration error. Established calibration approaches in the field require an exquisitely accurate sky model, and low-level sky model errors introduce calibration errors that corrupt the cosmological signal. We present a novel calibration approach called Delay-Weighted Calibration, or DWCal, that enables precise calibration even in the presence of sky model error. Sky model error does not affect all power spectrum modes equally, and DWCal fits calibration solutions preferentially from error-free modes. We apply this technique to simulated data, showing that it substantially reduces calibration error in the presence of realistic levels of sky model error and can improve 21 cm power spectrum sensitivity by approximately 2 orders of magnitude., No description provided., The absence of Type IIP core-collapse supernovae arising from progenitors above 17 solar masses suggests the existence of another evolutionary path by which massive stars end their lives. The direct collapse of a stellar core to a black hole without the production of a bright, explosive transient is expected to produce a long-lived, dim, red transient known as a failed supernova. Despite the detection of a number of candidates for disappearing massive stars in recent years, conclusive observational evidence for failed supernovae remains elusive. A custom-built pipeline designed for the detection of faint transients is used to re-analyse 10 yr of observations of 231 nearby galaxies from the PTF/ZTF surveys. This analysis recovers known supernovae, and yields a number of interesting transients. However, none of these are consistent with a failed supernova. Through Monte Carlo tests the recovery efficiency of our pipeline is quantified. By assuming failed supernovae occur as a Poissonian process with zero detections in the data set, 95 per cent upper limits to the rate of failed supernovae are calculated as a function of failed supernova absolute magnitude. We estimate failed supernovae to be less than 0.61, 0.33, 0.26, or 0.23 of the core-collapse SN rate for absolute magnitudes of -11, -12, -13, and -14, respectively. Finally, we show that if they exist, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find 1.7-3.7 failed SNe per year for an absolute bolometric luminosity of ~6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> out to distances of 33-43 Mpc, depending on their assumed spectral energy distribution., We describe a new polarised imaging pipeline implemented in the FHD software package. The pipeline is based on the optimal mapmaking imaging approach and performs horizon-to-horizon image reconstruction in all polarisation modes. We discuss the formalism behind the pipeline's polarised analysis, describing equivalent representations of the polarised beam response, or Jones matrix. We show that, for arrays where antennas have uniform polarisation alignments, defining a non-orthogonal instrumental polarisation basis enables accurate and efficient image reconstruction. Finally, we present a new calibration approach that leverages widefield effects to perform fully polarised calibration. This analysis pipeline underlies the analysis of Murchison Widefield Array data in Byrne et al. (2022, MNRAS, 510, 2011)., We present a broad-band map of polarized diffuse emission at 167-198 MHz developed from data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The map is designed to improve visibility simulation and precision calibration for 21 cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) experiments. It covers a large swath - 11 000 sq. deg. - of the Southern hemisphere sky in all four Stokes parameters and captures emission on angular scales of 1-9°. The band-averaged diffuse structure is pre-dominantly unpolarized but has significant linearly polarized structure near RA = 0 h. We evaluate the accuracy of the map by combining it with the GLEAM catalogue and simulating an observation from the MWA, demonstrating that the accuracy of the short baselines (6.1-50 wavelengths) now approaches the accuracy of the longer baselines typically used for EoR calibration. We discuss how to use the map for visibility simulation for a variety of interferometric arrays. The map has potential to improve calibration accuracy for experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array as well as the MWA., Calibration precision is currently a limiting systematic in 21 cm cosmology experiments. While there are innumerable calibration approaches, most can be categorized as either 'sky-based,' relying on an extremely accurate model of astronomical foreground emission, or 'redundant,' requiring a precisely regular array with near-identical antenna response patterns. Both of these classes of calibration are inflexible to the realities of interferometric measurement. In practice, errors in the foreground model, antenna position offsets, and beam response inhomogeneities degrade calibration performance and contaminate the cosmological signal. Here, we show that sky-based and redundant calibration can be unified into a highly general and physically motivated calibration framework based on a Bayesian statistical formalism. Our new framework includes sky-based and redundant calibration as special cases but can additionally support relaxing the rigid assumptions implicit in those approaches. We present simulation results demonstrating that, in a simple case, working in an intermediate regime between sky-based and redundant calibration improves calibration performance. Our framework is highly general and encompasses novel calibration approaches including techniques for calibrating compact non-redundant arrays, calibrating to incomplete sky models, and constraining calibration solutions across frequency., Detecting the EoR will require extremely precise measurements. The signal is very faint and is obscured by intervening emission, or foregrounds, that are 4-5 orders of magnitude brighter. Thus far, analyses have not achieved the precision required to measure the EoR signal. Calibration precision is a dominant limitation of these analyses. <P />This thesis focuses on understanding and mitigating calibration error for interferometric measurement of the EoR power spectrum signal. We propose a novel approach to calibration, called unified calibration, that is based on Bayesian statistics. We show in simulation that unified calibration outperforms the established techniques in the field. <P />Additionally, we present results that expand and improve the calibration sky model. Precision calibration requires an accurate and complete model of the sky signal, and we examine the impact of sky model error on calibration performance. We describe the development of a new polarized imaging pipeline that we then use to map diffuse emission at 182 MHz across 11,000 square degrees of the Southern Hemisphere sky. The map is presented in all four Stokes parameters and contains emission on scales of 1-9 degrees. We discuss the implementation of this diffuse map in calibration and explore its effect on calibration performance., We present a case study of a cloud-based computational workflow for processing large astronomical data sets from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) cosmology experiment. Cloud computing is well-suited to large-scale, episodic computation because it offers extreme scalability in a pay-for-use model. This facilitates fast turnaround times for testing computationally expensive analysis techniques. We describe how we have used the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform to efficiently and economically test and implement our data analysis pipeline. We discuss the challenges of working with the AWS spot market, which reduces costs at the expense of longer processing turnaround times, and we explore this tradeoff with a Monte Carlo simulation., We present a fully-polarized diffuse map of the southern sky (-1.6 to 7 hours RA, -50 to 0 degrees Dec) and discuss its applications for improved calibration and foreground removal for Epoch of Reionizaton (EoR) experiments. The map is produced with data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase I configuration and processed with the Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) software package. Foreground mapping is a critical component of precision calibration of 21-cm cosmology instruments. Calibration solutions experience frequency-dependent errors due to foreground model incompleteness, and array redundancy cannot eliminate this source of error. Limiting calibration to short baselines only can eliminate the calibration error modes that contaminate the EoR measurement but relies on an accurate diffuse foreground model. We present a map of polarized diffuse (1- to 10-degree scales) foreground emission and discuss its implications for improved calibration., Precise instrument calibration is critical to the success of 21 cm cosmology experiments. Unmitigated errors in calibration contaminate the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal, precluding a detection. Barry et al. characterized one class of inherent errors that emerge from calibrating to an incomplete sky model; however, it has been unclear if errors in the sky model affect the calibration of redundant arrays. In this paper, we show that redundant calibration is vulnerable to errors from sky model incompleteness even in the limit of perfect antenna positioning and identical beams. These errors are at a level that can overwhelm the EoR signal and prevent a detection in crucial power spectrum modes. Finally, we suggest error mitigation strategies with implications for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array., Determining orbits of unknown objects is a fundamental space situational awareness activity. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) currently relies on ground-based radars, optical telescopes, and the Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) System. The SBSS system overcomes many of the pitfalls of optical ground-based systems like limited observation times (e.g. weather and time of day) and measurement uncertainty from atmospheric effects. However, the SBSS satellite is in a low earth orbit (630 km, sun synchronous), and must look “up” for GEO objects. This paper analyzes the potential benefits of a GEO observation point for performing metric observations that are combined with ground-based data. Several different scenarios are considered to quantify the reduction in orbit uncertainty from these types of observations. All results are derived using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to process the observations. Orbital uncertainties are expressed in terms of the error covariance.","['2023arXiv231100896B', '10.48550/arXiv.2311.00896', 'arXiv:2311.00896', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad3a6a', '2024ApJ...966..221B', '2024zndo..10835888B', '10.5281/zenodo.10835888', '2024AAS...24345201B', '2024AAS...24326116B', '2023TNSCR2299....1B', '2023TNSCR2325....1B', '2023TNSAN.248....1B', '2023TNSCR2307....1B', '2023MNRAS.524.2978B', '10.1093/mnras/stad2049', 'arXiv:2302.06994', '10.48550/arXiv.2302.06994', '2023arXiv230206994B', '2023AAS...24231503B', 'arXiv:2208.04406', '10.3847/1538-4357/acac95', '2022arXiv220804406B', '2023ApJ...943..117B', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.04406', '2023AAS...24121505B', '2022zndo...7402471B', '10.5281/zenodo.7402471', '10.48550/arXiv.2201.12187', '2022arXiv220112187B', 'arXiv:2201.12187', '2022MNRAS.tmp.1481B', '10.1093/mnras/stac1308', '2022MNRAS.514.1188B', 'arXiv:2201.10653', '2022arXiv220110653B', '10.1017/pasa.2022.21', '10.48550/arXiv.2201.10653', '2022PASA...39...23B', '10.48550/arXiv.2107.11487', '2021MNRAS.tmp.2990B', 'arXiv:2107.11487', '2022MNRAS.510.2011B', '10.1093/mnras/stab3276', '2021arXiv210711487B', '2020arXiv200408463B', '2021MNRAS.tmp..670B', 'arXiv:2004.08463', '10.48550/arXiv.2004.08463', '2021MNRAS.503.2457B', '10.1093/mnras/stab647', '2021PhDT........11B', '10.48550/arXiv.2009.10223', '2021A&C....3400447B', '10.1016/j.ascom.2021.100447', '2020arXiv200910223B', 'arXiv:2009.10223', '2020AAS...23630805B', '10.48550/arXiv.1811.01378', '2018arXiv181101378B', '2019ApJ...875...70B', 'arXiv:1811.01378', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab107d', '2011amos.confE..48B']","[('calibration', 60), ('error', 39), ('array', 27), ('cm', 27), ('model', 27), ('sky', 25), ('power', 18), ('spectrum', 18), ('measurement', 16), ('signal', 16)]","[(('power', 'spectrum'), 18), (('sky', 'model'), 17), (('calibration', 'error'), 10), (('model', 'error'), 10), (('intensity', 'mapping'), 8), (('cm', 'cosmology'), 8), (('spectrum', 'mode'), 7), (('calibration', 'approach'), 7), (('failed', 'supernova'), 7), (('large', 'scale'), 5)]","[(('sky', 'model', 'error'), 8), (('power', 'spectrum', 'modes'), 7), (('cm', 'power', 'spectrum'), 5), (('large', 'scale', 'structure'), 4), (('cm', 'intensity', 'mapping'), 4), (('cm', 'cosmology', 'experiments'), 4), (('murchison', 'widefield', 'array'), 4), (('line', 'intensity', 'mapping'), 3), (('universe', 'large', 'scale'), 3), (('cm', 'emission', 'line'), 3)]",Dirty

For the first time, this work allows us to be able to compare the relative ages of transiting BD host stars for all 47 known transiting BDs (as of March 2024). This work also takes a more critical look at the potential causes of radius inflation in transiting BDs as a function of mass. Both low-mass (13-25 Jupiter masses) and high-mass (70-75 Jupiter masses) brown dwarfs show clear signs of radius inflation at ages beyond 1 Gyr, but it is unclear whether or not the inflation mechanisms are shared between low- and high-mass brown dwarfs. This study shows that for most BDs above 25 Jupiter masses, incident flux may be negligible as a primary factor in radius inflation, which highlights the mass dependence of this phenomenon and distinguishes it from incident flux radius inflation seen in the giant planet population., Models of substellar evolution are critical for a wide range of exoplanet science, such as inferring masses of directly imaged planets. Testing these models requires knowledge of masses, radii, and ages, which cannot be independently constrained for directly imaged planets and brown dwarfs. The population of transiting brown dwarfs has almost tripled over the past five years thanks to NASA's TESS Mission, now enabling a systematic test of substellar models from the mass, radius, and age measurements obtained from transiting brown dwarfs. Previous results demonstrate that both low-mass (13-25 Jupiter masses) and high-mass (70-75 Jupiter masses) brown dwarfs show clear signs of radius inflation with respect to substellar models, but it is unclear which inflation mechanisms are at play and whether or not these inflation mechanisms are shared between low- and high-mass brown dwarfs. A solution to understand these discrepancies is to determine robust ages for these objects via age dating of their host stars, which is now possible through a combination of techniques such as isochrone fitting, asteroseismology, and gyrochronology. I will present results from the first uniform transit, radial velocity, and host star age analysis of the largest number of transiting brown dwarf host stars to date. In addition to a uniform analysis of ages, this work also includes a homogeneous analysis of brown dwarf masses and radii made possible through the TESS mission and precise photometry and astrometry from the Gaia mission. First results show that, at a given mass, substellar models predict the age-radius evolution of intermediate-mass (40-65 Jupiter mass) brown dwarfs accurately at young ages, but perform poorly at ages beyond 1 Gyr. These results also show that radius inflation persists in low-mass and high-mass brown dwarfs, resulting in poor agreement with models., I report updates to the substellar mass-radius diagram for 11 transiting brown dwarfs (BDs) and low-mass stars published before the third data release from the Gaia mission (Gaia DR3). I re-analyse these transiting BD systems whose physical parameters were published between 2008 and 2019 and find that when using the parallax measurements from Gaia DR3, seven BDs show significant differences in their radius estimate or an improvement in the radius uncertainty. This has important implications for how these BDs are used to test substellar evolutionary models in the mass-radius diagram. The remaining four BDs show mass-radius estimates that are consistent with their previous pre-Gaia DR3 measurements. The seven BDs that show significant deviation from the original mass-radius measurements are AD 3116b, CoRoT-3b, CoRoT-15b, EPIC 201702477b, Kepler-39b, KOI-205b, and KOI-415b. Of these, AD 3116b is a known member of the Praesepe cluster at an age of 600 Myr. Additionally, some of the previously smallest known transiting BDs, KOI-205b and KOI-415b, are not as small as once thought, leaving the mass-radius region for the very oldest BDs relatively sparse as a result of this work., We report the discovery of TOI-2119b, a transiting brown dwarf (BD) that orbits and is completely eclipsed by an active M-dwarf star. Using light-curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and follow-up high-resolution Doppler spectroscopic observations, we find the BD has a radius of R<SUB>b</SUB> = 1.08 ± 0.03R<SUB>J</SUB>, a mass of M<SUB>b</SUB> = 64.4 ± 2.3M<SUB>J</SUB>, an orbital period of P = 7.200865 ± 0.00002 d, and an eccentricity of e = 0.337 ± 0.002. The host star has a mass of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.53 ± 0.02M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a radius of R<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.50 ± 0.01R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3621 ± 48K, and a metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H]=+0.06\pm 0.08$. TOI-2119b joins an emerging population of transiting BDs around M-dwarf host stars, with TOI-2119 being the ninth such system. These M-dwarf-brown dwarf systems typically occupy mass ratios near q = M<SUB>b</SUB>/M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≈ 0.1-0.2, which separates them from the typical mass ratios for systems with transiting substellar objects and giant exoplanets that orbit more massive stars. The nature of the secondary eclipse of the BD by the star enables us to estimate the effective temperature of the substellar object to be 2030 ± 84K, which is consistent with predictions by substellar evolutionary models., To characterize the Radial Velocities of TOI-811, we obtained a series of 11 spectroscopic observations using the CHIRON spectrograph on the 1.5m Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) telescope, located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Chile. CHIRON has a resolving power of R~80000 over the wavelength region 4100-8700Å. <P />We use the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) instrument on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, to obtain spectra for both TOI-811 and TOI-852. TRES has a resolving power of R~44000 and covers a wavelength range of 3900-9100Å. <P />We obtained 11 spectroscopic observations of TOI-852 from 2019 August 4 to 26 with the high-resolution CORALIE spectrograph on the Swiss 1.2m Euler telescope at the La Silla Observatory, Chile. CORALIE has a resolving power of R~60000. <P />(1 data file)., We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs (BDs), TOI-811b and TOI-852b, from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. These two transiting BDs have similar masses but very different radii and ages. Their host stars have similar masses, effective temperatures, and metallicities. The younger and larger transiting BD is TOI-811b at a mass of M<SUB>b</SUB> = 59.9 ± 13.0M<SUB>J</SUB> and radius of R<SUB>b</SUB> = 1.26 ± 0.06R<SUB>J</SUB>, and it orbits its host star in a period of P = 25.16551 ± 0.00004 days. We derive the host star's age of ${93}_{-29}^{+61}$ Myr from an application of gyrochronology. The youth of this system, rather than external heating from its host star, is why this BD's radius is relatively large. This constraint on the youth of TOI-811b allows us to test substellar mass-radius evolutionary models at young ages where the radius of BDs changes rapidly. TOI-852b has a similar mass at M<SUB>b</SUB> = 53.7 ± 1.4M<SUB>J</SUB> but is much older (4 or 8 Gyr, based on bimodal isochrone results of the host star) and is also smaller with a radius of R<SUB>b</SUB> = 0.83 ± 0.04R<SUB>J</SUB>. TOI-852b's orbital period is P = 4.94561 ± 0.00008 days. TOI-852b joins the likes of other old transiting BDs that trace out the oldest substellar mass-radius evolutionary models where contraction of the BD's radius slows and approaches a constant value. Both host stars have a mass of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.32M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ± 0.05 and differ in their radii, T<SUB>eff</SUB>, and [Fe/H], with TOI-811 having R<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.27 ± 0.09R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6107 ± 77 K, and [Fe/H] = + 0.40 ± 0.09 and TOI-852 having R<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.71 ± 0.04R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 5768 ± 84 K, and [Fe/H] = + 0.33 ± 0.09. We take this opportunity to examine how TOI-811b and TOI-852b serve as test points for young and old substellar isochrones, respectively., This thesis presents an analysis of transiting brown dwarf (BD) systems and examines their effectivenessas tests to substellar evolutionary models. The radius, mass, and age of transiting BDsystems are the parameters most useful in testing these models and in this work, I show how mycollaborators and I have used three facilities to derive these parameters for transiting BD systems.These facilities are: 1) NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, 2) the TillinghastReflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), and 3) ESA's Gaia mission. In this work, I use TESS,TRES, and Gaia in tandem to detect and characterize 10 new transiting BD systems with preciseradius, mass, and age determinations (in most cases). Most of the age determinations in this workcome solely from stellar isochrone models of the host star, but several systems have age constraintsfrom stellar clusters and gyrochronology, which we use to constrain the youth of one transiting BD,TOI-811b, to less than 200 Myr. This is important because it is at these young ages when the radii ofBDs changes most rapidly. <P />In addition, I apply parallax measurements from the Gaia mission's second data release (GaiaDR2) to improve the radius determinations of 10 transiting BD systems published prior to GaiaDR2 and the launch of the TESS mission. For these 10 previously published systems, new lightcurves from TESS are used, when possible, and the stellar distances, luminosities, and radii areupdated with the parallaxes from Gaia DR2, which improves our constraint on the companionBD's radius. This work has significantly improved the radius determinations of 7 previously knowntransiting BDs, including CoRoT-15b and AD 3116b, whose radius uncertainties have been improvedfrom 15% to 5-7%, making them much more effective for testing substellar evolutionary models. <P />Using these 20 new and previously known transiting BD systems, I have shown that the substellarevolutionary models ranging from young to old substellar isochrones are generally able toreproduce the observed radius, mass, and age determinations of the known transiting BD population., Traditionally, astronomers have separated giant planets from brown dwarfs based on the object's mass. Objects more massive than 13 Jupiter masses but less massive than 80 Jupiter masses are considered to be brown dwarfs. However, in detail, the lower mass threshold is 11 to 16 Jupiter masses depending on the metallicity of the object. This betrays how arbitrary a purely mass-based distinction between planets and brown dwarfs is. Instead, we take a critical look at the population of brown dwarfs for which we have the most fundamental information: transiting brown dwarfs. Transiting brown dwarfs provide us their mass, radius, and sometimes age, which makes them useful for directly testing substellar evolutionary models. Through a better understanding of how well these models describe the population of transiting brown dwarfs, we will develop a better definition of what makes a brown dwarf different than a giant planet: its formation mechanism. It is certainly true that in the mass range spanning between giant planets and low-mass stars that the dominant formation mechanism must change in a significant way. If we can determine which mass or distribution of masses that this change occurs at, then we will have a more physical way to distinguish planets from brown dwarfs. In this talk, we will review how this thesis work has used the TESS mission to contribute 6 new objects to the transiting brown dwarf population and we will examine a few specific examples of transiting brown dwarfs whose masses, radii, and ages have served as useful tests to substellar isochrones., We report the discovery of two intermediate-mass transiting brown dwarfs (BDs), TOI-569b and TOI-1406b, from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. TOI-569b has an orbital period of P = 6.55604 ± 0.00016 days, a mass of M<SUB>b</SUB> = 64.1 ± 1.9 ${M}_{{\rm{J}}}$ , and a radius of R<SUB>b</SUB> = 0.75 ± 0.02 ${R}_{{\rm{J}}}$ . Its host star, TOI-569, has a mass of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.21 ± 0.05 $\,{M}_{\odot }$ , a radius of R<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.47 ± 0.03 $\,{R}_{\odot }$ , $[\mathrm{Fe}/{\rm{H}}]=+0.29\pm 0.09$ dex, and an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 5768 ± 110 K. TOI-1406b has an orbital period of P = 10.57415 ± 0.00063 days, a mass of M<SUB>b</SUB> = 46.0 ± 2.7 ${M}_{{\rm{J}}}$ , and a radius of R<SUB>b</SUB> = 0.86 ± 0.03 ${R}_{{\rm{J}}}$ . The host star for this BD has a mass of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.18 ± 0.09 $\,{M}_{\odot }$ , a radius of R<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.35 ± 0.03 $\,{R}_{\odot }$ , $[\mathrm{Fe}/{\rm{H}}]=-0.08\pm 0.09$ dex, and an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6290 ± 100 K. Both BDs are in circular orbits around their host stars and are older than 3 Gyr based on stellar isochrone models of the stars. TOI-569 is one of two slightly evolved stars known to host a transiting BD (the other being KOI-415). TOI-1406b is one of three known transiting BDs to occupy the mass range of 40-50 ${M}_{{\rm{J}}}$ and one of two to have a circular orbit at a period near 10 days (with the first being KOI-205b). Both BDs have reliable ages from stellar isochrones, in addition to their well-constrained masses and radii, making them particularly valuable as tests for substellar isochrones in the BD mass-radius diagram., The TESS mission has been a crucial tool in the characterization of 5 new transiting brown dwarfs with more discoveries expected to follow as it completes its primary mission into 2020. There are approximately two dozen known transiting brown dwarfs that have precisely measured masses and radii, which require ground-based follow up spectroscopy in combination with the light curves from the TESS mission to obtain. Due to the relatively low number of transiting brown dwarfs that have been discovered, we are limited in how well we can study this population of objects. Still, we may compare the measured masses and radii of brown dwarfs to theoretical substellar evolutionary models in order to find clues to the origins of this population. As more brown dwarfs are discovered, we may find that the arbitrarily chosen mass range that defines them (13 to 80 Jupiter masses) does not appropriately reflect their formation mechanisms. We have analyzed 3 brown dwarfs that have been discovered by the TESS mission and present our findings and evidence for the favored formation scenarios for each., The spectra for KOI-607, EP212, and CWW 89A were taken with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) instrument on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. The spectrograph has a resolution of R=44000 and covers wavelengths from 390 to 910 nm. CWW 89A has 18 TRES spectra that were taken in 2015 and 2016 with exposure times ranging from 1200 to 1700 s and a signal-to-noise (S/N) per resolution element ranging from 22 to 34 (except for one point near phase 0.86, which has an exposure time of 400 s and an S/N of 6.8; this spectrum is not used to derive stellar parameters). EP212 has 14 TRES spectra taken in 2018 with exposure times ranging from 400 to 1800 s and an S/N ranging from 22 to 45. KOI-607 also has 14 TRES spectra and these were taken in 2014 (except for one point at phase 0.80 that was taken in 2018) with exposure times ranging from 1800 to 3600 s and an S/N ranging from 13 to 17. <P />(5 data files)., We present the discoveries of a brown dwarf (BD) and a low-mass star from the Kepler and K2 missions. The newly discovered BD is EPIC 212036875b and the low-mass star is KOI-607b. EPIC 212036875b has a mass of M <SUB> b </SUB> = 52.3 ± 1.9 M <SUB>J</SUB>, a radius of R <SUB> b </SUB> = 0.874 ± 0.017 R <SUB>J</SUB>, and orbits its host star in P = 5.169885 ± 0.000027 days. Its host star is a late F-type star with M <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.288 ± 0.065 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.498 ± 0.025 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 6238 ±60 K. KOI-607b has a mass of M <SUB> b </SUB> = 95.1 ± 3.4 M <SUB>J</SUB>, a radius of R <SUB> b </SUB> = 1.089 ± 0.089 R <SUB>J</SUB>, and an orbital period of P = 5.89399148 ± 0.00000060 days. The primary star in the KOI-607 system is a G dwarf with M <SUB>⋆</SUB> =0.993 ± 0.052 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.915 ± 0.031 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 5418 ± 87 K. We also revisit a BD, CWW 89Ab, that was previously published by Nowak et al. (under the designation EPIC 219388192b). CWW 89Ab is one of two known transiting BDs associated with a star cluster, which illustrates the need for more BDs with accurate masses, radii, and reliable age determinations to test theoretical models. We find that the newly discovered BD, EPIC 212036875b, falls in the middle of the so-called BD desert, indicating that EPIC 212036875b is either a particularly rare object, or the BD desert may not be so dry after all., The brown dwarf desert describes the lack of observed brown dwarfs orbiting in short periods (less than on the order of 30 days) around main sequence stars. Using data from the Kepler spacecraft, we have found two new short-period companions to main sequence stars. The light curves from the Kepler and K2 missions indicate Jupiter-sized, short-period companions that were followed up with radial velocity measurements using the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) in 2014 and 2018. In addition to the spectra and light curves, we use parallaxes from the Gaia mission to constrain the parameters of the host star. The first object is a low-mass star of approximately 90 Jupiter masses orbiting a solar twin. The second object is a brown dwarf of approximately 50 Jupiter masses orbiting a late F-type star. Both of these stellar companions have 5 day periods and are eccentric. The brown dwarf is interesting as it occupies the sparsest region of the brown dwarf desert. The low-mass star is right on the mass boundary separating brown dwarfs from stars., Nearly every star observed in the Galaxy has one or more companions that play an integral role in the evolution of the star. Whether it is a planet or another star, a companion opens up opportunities for unique forms of analysis to be done on a system. Some 2400 lightyears away, there is a 3-10 Myr old binary system called KH 15D, which not only includes two T Tauri K-type stars in a close orbit of 48 days, but also a truncated, coherently precessing warped disk in a circumbinary orbit.In binary systems, a double-lined spectroscopic binary may be observable in spectra. This is a spectrum that contains a mixture of each star's properties and manifests as two sets of spectral emission and absorption lines that correspond to each star. Slightly different is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, where only one set of spectral lines from one star is visible. The data of KH 15D are studied in the form of a double single-lined spectroscopic binary. This means that at two separate observing times, a single-lined spectroscopic binary is obtained from one of the stars of KH 15D. This is possible because of the circumbinary disk that blocks one star at a time from view.Here, we study this binary system with a combination of archival echelle data from the Keck Observatory and new echelle data from Las Campanas Observatory. This optical data is reduced with a new Python-based pipeline available on GitHub. The objective is to measure the mass function of the binary star and refine the current values of each star's properties.","['2024tsc3.confE..64C', '10.5281/zenodo.13696716', '2024ESS.....560708C', '2022arXiv221202502C', '10.1093/mnras/stac3720', 'arXiv:2212.02502', '10.48550/arXiv.2212.02502', '2023MNRAS.519.5177C', '2022MNRAS.tmp...11C', '10.48550/arXiv.2202.08842', '2022MNRAS.tmp.1608C', '2022MNRAS.514.4944C', '2022arXiv220208842C', '10.1093/mnras/stac1666', 'arXiv:2202.08842', '2021yCat..51610097C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51610097', '2021AJ....161...97C', '2020arXiv200913515C', 'arXiv:2009.13515', '10.3847/1538-3881/abd4e1', '10.48550/arXiv.2009.13515', '2021PhDT........12C', '2021AAS...23731403C', '10.3847/1538-3881/ab9b84', '10.48550/arXiv.2002.01943', '2020arXiv200201943C', '2020AJ....160...53C', 'arXiv:2002.01943', '2020AAS...23512206C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51580038', '2019yCat..51580038C', 'arXiv:1903.03118', '2019arXiv190303118C', '10.48550/arXiv.1903.03118', '2019AJ....158...38C', '10.3847/1538-3881/ab245e', '2019AAS...23346501C', '2018AAS...23124603C']","[('mass', 78), ('radius', 51), ('bd', 49), ('star', 49), ('dwarf', 46), ('brown', 42), ('transiting', 41), ('age', 27), ('toi', 26), ('host', 21)]","[(('brown', 'dwarf'), 42), (('mass', 'radius'), 22), (('host', 'star'), 20), (('transiting', 'bd'), 18), (('transiting', 'brown'), 17), (('jupiter', 'mass'), 12), (('low', 'mass'), 9), (('tess', 'mission'), 8), (('evolutionary', 'model'), 8), (('dwarf', 'bd'), 7)]","[(('transiting', 'brown', 'dwarfs'), 12), (('substellar', 'evolutionary', 'models'), 6), (('transiting', 'brown', 'dwarf'), 5), (('transiting', 'bd', 'systems'), 5), (('brown', 'dwarf', 'bd'), 4), (('mass', 'jupiter', 'masses'), 4), (('mass', 'brown', 'dwarfs'), 4), (('planets', 'brown', 'dwarfs'), 4), (('transiting', 'exoplanet', 'survey'), 4), (('exoplanet', 'survey', 'satellite'), 4)]",Dirty

The simulation uses an M1 neutrino transport scheme to track neutrino-matter interactions and is well suited to studying the resulting nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. A magnetized wind is driven from the remnant and ejects neutron-rich material at a quasi-steady-state rate of 0.8 × 10<SUP>-1</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We find that the ejecta in our simulations underproduce r-process abundances beyond the second r-process peak. For sufficiently long-lived remnants, these outflows alone can produce blue kilonovae, including the blue kilonova component observed for AT2017gfo., Along with binary neutron star mergers, the inspiral and merger of a black hole and a neutron star is a predicted site of r-process nucleosynthesis and associated kilonovae. For the right mass ratio, very large amounts of neutron-rich material (relative to the dynamical ejecta) may become unbound from the post-merger accretion disk. We simulate a suite of four post-merger disks with three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with time-dependent Monte Carlo neutrino transport. We find that within 10<SUP>4</SUP> GM <SUB>BH</SUB>/c <SUP>3</SUP> (~200-500 ms), the outflows from these disks are very close to the threshold conditions for robust r-process nucleosynthesis. For these conditions, the detailed properties of the outflow determine whether a full r-process can or cannot occur, implying that a wide range of observable phenomena is possible. We show that on average the disk outflow lanthanide fraction is suppressed relative to the solar isotopic pattern. In combination with the dynamical ejecta, these outflows imply a kilonova with both blue and red components., We investigate r-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission resulting from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers based on a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. The simulation includes a microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS) and neutrino emission and absorption effects via a leakage scheme. We track the thermodynamic properties of the ejecta using Lagrangian tracer particles and determine its composition using the nuclear reaction network SkyNet. We investigate the impact of neutrinos on the nucleosynthetic yields by varying the neutrino luminosities during post-processing. The ejecta show a broad distribution with respect to their electron fraction Y<SUB>e</SUB>, peaking between ~0.25-0.4 depending on the neutrino luminosity employed. We find that the resulting r-process abundance patterns differ from solar, with no significant production of material beyond the second r-process peak when using luminosities recorded by the tracer particles. We also map the HMNS outflows to the radiation hydrodynamics code SNEC and predict the evolution of the bolometric luminosity as well as broadband light curves of the kilonova. The bolometric light curve peaks on the timescale of a day and the brightest emission is seen in the infrared bands. This is the first direct calculation of the r-process yields and kilonova signal expected from HMNS winds based on 3D GRMHD simulations. For longer-lived remnants, these winds may be the dominant ejecta component producing the kilonova emission., The merger of neutron star binaries is accompanied by the ejection of neutron-rich matter that undergoes r-process nucleosynthesis, enriching our Universe with heavy elements. Since the detection of the kilonova associated with the neutron star merger event GW170817, we have the first strong evidence that such mergers are indeed a site where heavy element nucleosynthesis takes place. However, significant uncertainties remain when it comes to the details of heavy element production, with respect to both nuclear physics processes and hydrodynamical modeling. The post-merger evolution of the merger remnant is the most uncertain piece of the problem, and research on this phase is undergoing intense development due to its importance for linking numerical simulations and astrophysical observations. In this talk, I will review our current understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. I will discuss outflows from post-merger remnants, various mass ejection mechanisms, and the role of neutrinos in setting nucleosynthesis yields. Detailed and accurate modeling of the post-merger phase is vital for making optimal use of multi-messenger observations and developing a complete picture of the origin of the heavy elements., Terrestrial rocks / Minerals change, spectra too / Mars looks similar., We present bolometric and broadband light curves and spectra for a suite of core-collapse supernova models exploded self-consistently in spherical symmetry within the PUSH framework. We analyze broad trends in these light curves and categorize them based on morphology. We find that these morphological categories relate simply to the progenitor radius and mass of the hydrogen envelope. We present a proof-of-concept sensitive-variable analysis, indicating that an important determining factor in the properties of a light curve within a given category is <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass. We follow spectra from the photospheric to the nebular phase. These spectra show characteristic iron-line blanketing at short wavelengths and Doppler-shifted Fe II and Ti II absorption lines. To enable this analysis, we develop a first-of-its-kind pipeline from a massive progenitor model, through a self-consistent explosion in spherical symmetry, to electromagnetic counterparts. This opens the door to more detailed analyses of the collective properties of these observables. We provide a machine-readable database of our light curves and spectra online at go.ncsu.edu/astrodata., Astrobites is a graduate student-run website, aimed at making current astrophysical research accessible to a broader audience by publishing plain-language summaries of recent research papers.

Weekday posts summarize cutting-edge research papers from the ArXiv preprint server, while additional ""beyond astro-ph"" content includes career advice, conference live-blogging, summaries of landmark astronomy papers, and more. Our audience includes undergraduate students, graduate students, professional scientists and astronomy enthusiasts. Astrobites has inspired similar science communication efforts in other languages as well as scientific disciplines. Today, Astrobites is broadening to include new content, discussing topics such as science policy and equity and inclusion efforts, and expanding its role as a pedagogical tool for teaching about current research., In a previously presented proof-of-principle study, we established a parameterized spherically symmetric explosion method (PUSH) that can reproduce many features of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for a wide range of pre-explosion models. The method is based on the neutrino-driven mechanism and follows collapse, bounce, and explosion. There are two crucial aspects of our model for nucleosynthesis predictions. First, the mass cut and explosion energy emerge simultaneously from the simulation (determining, for each stellar model, the amount of Fe-group ejecta). Second, the interactions between neutrinos and matter are included consistently (setting the electron fraction of the innermost ejecta). In the present paper, we use the successful explosion models from Paper II (Ebinger+, 2019, J/ApJ/870/1) that include two sets of pre-explosion models at solar metallicity, with combined masses between 10.8 and 120M<SUB>ȯ</SUB>.

The mechanism for grain accretion has proven difficult to model dynamically. Here, we attempt to test the thesis that the accretion process is electrostatically-driven by non-uniform charging of grains in a low discharge/weak field environment equivalent to periodic conditions in protoplanetary nebulae during solar discharge events such as flares. We simulate in the laboratory the behavior of grains in relationship to surfaces in such an environment. The nature of the observed disaggregation, repulsion, and acceleration of grains away from initial surfaces, and their reaggregation as coatings on surrounding oppositely charged surfaces, provide an empirical experimental basis for an electrostatically-driven model for grain behavior and accretion. Similar weak discharge processes in the protoplanetary disk solar nebula could give rise to increased grain acceleration and collisional compression induced surface coating, necessary conditions for increased accretion. The frequency, timing, and level of energetic output of the proto-sun would influence the effectiveness of such processes in developing stable aggregates, and the nature of the solar system that would result., We have had the first successful tests for a low power, lightweight electrostatically-based tool to remove dust in the airlock environment and, in the process, demonstrated plasma/dust interactions with implications for solar system formation., To enable in-situ detection of biomarkers in extreme environments, we describe a planned field test of an innovative mobile science laboratory (IMSL) that consists of an advanced 32- channel nanotechnology chemical sensor (NanoChem) on a reconfigurable 12-tetrahedral walker (TET). The NanoChem will provide in-situ identification and analysis of volatiles such as methane, ammonia and NO2 to concentrations of ppm and ppb. The TET will enable access to boulder fields, gullies, caves, vents and fumaroles that would likely harbor microbial life or signatures of past life, but are not accessible to wheeled or legged science platforms. The TET will also allow optimal placement of instruments into hard-to-reach crevasses for in-situ measurements. The IMSL also carries a vision system and GPS receivers to image geological features and identify their locations during its traversal. The field campaign in Iceland is designed to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the IMSL and to determine the best practices for remote operation on rugged volcanic terrain. It will also serve to test the IMSL’s survivability and reliability in a challenging terrestrial environment that is analogous to environments on Mars. The NanoChem will be used to survey and characterize gas signatures in Iceland active hydrothermal systems for comparison and validation with data obtained with conventional methods. The IMSL will be teleoperated over a wireless Ethernet link from a nearby ground station. In-situ observations and measurements will be sent to the ground station over the wireless link. The IMSLwould enable the search for life in volcanic terrain and/or water near the poles on Mars., Here we present the results of our ongoing efforts to design and develop tools to remove dust on the lunar surface based on our characterization of the nature of dust particles and forces affecting them., We are developing the dust control tool SPARCLE which works through the use of oppositely charged particle particle beams to control tool surface potential in order to attract and remove dust from surfaces entering the airlock., We are in the process of developing extremely mobile TET Rovers with the reconfigurable architecture essential in the crossing or exploration of rugged terrains of great potential interest, including volcanic terrains which could harbor life on Mars., We are in the process of developing Tetrahedral Explorer Technologies (TETs) for the extreme mobility needed to explore remote, rugged terrain. TET architecture is based on the tetrahedron as building block, acting singly or interconnected, where apices act as nodes from which struts reversibly deploy. Conformable tetrahedra are the simplest space-filling form the way triangles are the simplest plane-filling facets. The tetrahedral framework acts as a simple skeletal muscular structure. Reconfigurable architecture is essential in exploration because reaching features of the greatest potential interest requires crossing a wide range of terrains. Thus, areas of interest are relatively inaccessible to permanently appendaged vehicles. For example, morphology and geochemistry of interior basins, walls, and ejecta blankets of impact structures must all be studied to understand the nature of an impact event. The crater floor might be relatively flat and navigable, while typical crater walls are variably sloping, and dominated by unconsolidated debris. To be totally functional, structures must form pseudo-appendages varying in size, rate, and manner of deployment (gait). We have already prototyped a simple robotic walker from a single reconfigurable tetrahedron capable of tumbling and are simulating and building a prototype of the more evolved 12Tetrahedral Walker (Autonomous Lunar Investigator) which has interior nodes for payload, more continuous motion, and is commandable through a user friendly interface. Our current applications consist of a more differentiated architecture to form detachable, reconfigurable, reshapable linearly extendable bodies (Class W or Worm), ranging from arms terminating in opposable digits (Class S or Spider) to act as manual assistant subsystems on rovers, to autonomous pseudo-hominid clamberers (Class M or Mammal), with extensions terminating in a wider range of sensors. We are now simulating Class W and Class S gaits and will be building a prototype rover arm. Ultimately, complex continuous n-tetrahedral structures, more advanced versions of Class A, will have deployable outer skin, and even higher degrees of freedom. Combined high and low level intelligence through an extended neural interface will allow `shape shifting' for required function, from surface-conformable lander to amorphous rover to concave surface formation for antenna function. Such architecture will consist of reusable, reconfigurable, mobile, and self-repairing structures, capable of acting as a multi-functional infrastructure. TET systems will act as robotic adjuncts to human explorers, enabling access to otherwise inaccessible resources essential to sustaining human presence., , We have a considerable amount of work ahead of us to determine the importance of the wealth of new information emerging in the fields of sub-cellular, cellular and tissue biology in order to improve the estimation of radiation risk at low dose and protracted dose-rate. In this paper, we suggest that there is a need to develop models of the specific health effects of interest (e.g., carcinogenesis in specific tissues), which embody as much of the mechanistic (i.e., biological) information as is deemed necessary. Although it is not realistic to expect that every radiation-induced process should or could be included, we can hope that the major factors that shape the time dependence of evolution of damage can be identified and quantified to the point where reasonable estimations of risk can be made. Regarding carcinogenesis in particular, the structure of the model itself plays a role in determining the relative importance of various processes. We use a specific form of a multi-stage carcinogenic model to illustrate this point. We show in a review of the application of this model to lung cancer incidence and mortality in two exposed populations that for both high- and low-LET radiation, there is evidence of an ""inverse dose-rate"" or protraction effect. This result could be of some considerable importance, because it would imply that risk from protracted exposure even to low-LET radiation might be greater than from acute exposure, an opinion not currently held in the radiation protection community. This model also allows prediction of the evolution of the risk over the lifetimes of the exposed individuals. One inference is that radiation-induced initiation (i.e., the first cellular carcinogenic event(s) occurring in normal tissue after the passage of the radiation) may not be the driving factor in the risk, but more important may be the effects of the radiation on already-initiated cells in the tissue. Although present throughout the length of the exposure, radiation-induced initiation appears to play a dominating role only very late in life, and only for those individuals who began their exposure early in life. These conclusions are very dependent, of course, on the hypotheses embodied in the initiation-promotion-conversion paradigm of carcinogenesis. We suggest that recently identified processes, such as the ""bystander effect"", might affect initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion in different ways. Finally, the manner in which the quality of radiation affects these processes must be understood in the context of the mixed high- and low-LET radiations that are found in the space environment. Important directions in critical experiment definition are suggested, including a renewed emphasis on well-designed animal experiments over extended periods of time., We discuss the use of the unique space-time separated measurements that will obtained by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Solar Terrestrial Probe mission for better understanding the dynamics of the terrestrial inner magnetosphere. The first phase of MMS will involve a low inclination orbit approximately 1.2 X 12 earth radii geocentric. The MMS primary science goals center on measurements made at the outer part of this orbit. However measurements will also be possible during the inner part of the orbit which would allow studies of microscale processes of importance to inner magnetospheric dynamics. We will discuss the applicability of these observations to the objectives of the Living With A Space Geospace program","['10.48550/arXiv.2305.07738', '2024ApJ...961L..26C', '2023arXiv230507738C', 'arXiv:2305.07738', '10.3847/2041-8213/ad0fe1', '10.48550/arXiv.2212.10691', '2022arXiv221210691C', '10.3847/2041-8213/acba16', '2023ApJ...945L..13C', 'arXiv:2212.10691', '2021arXiv211200772C', '2023MNRAS.518.5313C', '10.48550/arXiv.2112.00772', '10.1093/mnras/stac3128', '2022MNRAS.tmp.2960C', 'arXiv:2112.00772', '2022APS..APRX01001C', '2022LPICo2678.2401C', '2020arXiv200805498C', '2021ApJ...921..143C', '10.48550/arXiv.2008.05498', 'arXiv:2008.05498', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac0dc5', '2020AAS...23633904C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18700002', '2020yCat..18700002C', '10.3847/1538-4357/aae7d2', 'arXiv:1805.00498', '10.48550/arXiv.1805.00498', '2018arXiv180500498C', '2019ApJ...870....2C', '10.1007/s11038-010-9356-1', '2010EM&P..tmp...10C', '2010EM&P..107..147C', '2010LPI....41.1254C', '2009AGUFM.P43C1447C', '2009LPI....40.1128C', '2008LPI....39.1309C', '2006LPI....37.1129C', '2005AGUFM.P41A0922C', '2005mcsp.conf..473C', '2004AdSpR..34.1404C', '10.1016/j.asr.2004.03.011', '2003AGUFMSM41C0578C']","[('process', 24), ('model', 19), ('merger', 14), ('ejecta', 13), ('explosion', 13), ('neutron', 12), ('neutrino', 12), ('nucleosynthesis', 12), ('radiation', 12), ('star', 11)]","[(('neutron', 'star'), 9), (('light', 'curve'), 6), (('explosion', 'model'), 6), (('process', 'nucleosynthesis'), 5), (('post', 'merger'), 5), (('star', 'merger'), 4), (('wide', 'range'), 4), (('heavy', 'element'), 4), (('pre', 'explosion'), 4), (('fe', 'group'), 4)]","[(('pre', 'explosion', 'models'), 4), (('binary', 'neutron', 'star'), 3), (('general', 'relativistic', 'magnetohydrodynamic'), 2), (('neutron', 'star', 'merger'), 2), (('nucleosynthesis', 'kilonova', 'emission'), 2), (('neutron', 'rich', 'material'), 2), (('neutron', 'star', 'mergers'), 2), (('dimensional', 'general', 'relativistic'), 2), (('broadband', 'light', 'curves'), 2), (('modeling', 'post', 'merger'), 2)]",Dirty

However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small (1 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> &lt; R<SUB>p</SUB> &lt; 8 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>), close-in (P<SUB>orb</SUB> &lt; 10 days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright (6 &lt; T &lt; 10) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection–recovery tests and determine the 3σ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns (4 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> &lt; R<SUB>p</SUB> &lt; 8 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>), sub-Neptunes (2 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> &lt; R<SUB>p</SUB> &lt; 4 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>), and super-Earths (1 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> &lt; R<SUB>p</SUB> &lt; 2 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>). We find upper limits of 2.2 ± 0.4 sub-Saturns and 9.1 ± 1.8 sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than 3× and 6× lower than Kepler-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of 186 ± 34 super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than 1.5× lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star–disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres., We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in (P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 1.74 days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star (λ). We measured λ = 6.°9 ± 10.°0, suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel–Kozai–Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is one of few measurements of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot-Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects., Hot stars are known to have spin axes that are frequently misaligned with the orbital axes of their hot Jupiters. These high ""stellar obliquities"" are thought to be a consequence of either (1) dynamical interactions between the planets and massive outer companions, or (2) primordial misalignments between the stars and their protostellar disks. While these mechanisms can produce similar outcomes, they differ in one important way: the former has a dependence on the planet mass (or, more precisely, the mass ratio between the inner planet and its hypothetical outer companion), whereas the latter does not. Currently, the vast majority of hot Jupiters with these measurements are low in mass, largely because transiting super-Jovian-mass planets and brown dwarfs are rare, causing them to be found primarily around faint stars that make challenging targets for most ground-based telescopes. This selection bias has made it difficult to disentangle these two processes, greatly limiting our understanding of hot Jupiter formation. To gain new insight, we are undertaking a survey to measure the obliquities of hot stars with massive transiting companions using the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph. We present early findings from this survey, including a stellar obliquity measurement of the GPX-1 system, which contains an early F-type star and a transiting 20 Jupiter mass brown dwarf. In addition, we discuss our plans for the survey moving forward and detail our ability to build up a statistically meaningful sample of these systems., Hot stars are known to have spin axes that are frequently misaligned with the orbital axes of their transiting hot Jupiters. These high ""stellar obliquities"" are thought to be relics of the migration processes that brought the giant planets from their birthplaces to the close-in orbits at which we observe them today. However, a vast majority of the hot Jupiters in this sample are relatively low in mass, meaning it is unknown if this tendency for misalignment changes for more massive objects. This has historically been due to the intrinsic rarity of super-Jovian planets and brown dwarfs in close-in orbits, which has made it challenging to find systems suitable for studying this trend. In recent years, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite has changed this landscape: dozens of massive hot Jupiters and close-in brown dwarfs have been discovered around hot and relatively bright stars that are amenable to obliquity measurements. We present early results of a survey to measure the spin-orbit alignments of these systems, including a measurement of the obliquity of GPX-1, an early F-type star with a transiting brown dwarf, made with the Keck Planet Finder spectrograph. We discuss how these measurements will inform our understandings of star-planet tidal interactions and the origins of these rare objects., Transit and radial velocity (RV) surveys have enabled occurrence rate estimates for planets of various sizes orbiting close to FGKM-type stars. However, due to observational biases, the landscape of close-in planets orbiting relatively hot and massive A-type stars is still largely unexplored. The Kepler and K2 missions observed too few A-type stars to enable demographic studies of their planetary systems, and RV surveys have historically avoided A-type stars because their rapid rotation rates hinder measurements of the reflex motions caused by orbiting planets. By observing nearly the entire sky, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is capable of detecting transiting planets around over 100,000 A-type stars, providing the best opportunity yet to study short-period planets orbiting these hot stars. <P />We present results of an effort to calculate the occurrence rate of small planets (i.e., planets smaller than Saturn) orbiting A-type stars for the first time. Due to the large pixels of the TESS cameras, many transiting planet candidates detected in TESS data are false positives caused by nearby eclipsing binary stars that are blended with the target star in the TESS data. To determine which candidates are true planets, we used a combination of statistical and observational methods. First, we developed TRICERATOPS, a publicly available code that is capable of distinguishing true planets from false positives in TESS data using a Bayesian analysis procedure. Second, we underwent an extensive 60+ night observing campaign to explicitly search for false positives using ground-based telescopes. Through this investigation, we discovered the Neptune-size planet HD 56414 b, which is one of only two planets smaller than Jupiter known to exist around a star hotter than 8000 K. <P />We find that small planets orbiting A-type stars with orbital periods under 10 days are extremely rare, indicating that small planets are: (1) unable to form in-situ very close to A-type stars, (2) unable to migrate very close to A-type stars, or (3) unable to retain their atmospheres under the immense amount of near ultraviolet irradiation from their A-type stars, leaving only small cores that are undetectable in TESS data. We explore the latter scenario by simulating atmospheric mass loss from a short-period Neptune-size planet due to photoevaporation, finding that this mechanism can efficiently strip these planets of their gaseous envelopes when they orbit very hot stars. <P />This work is supported by NASA FINESST award 80NSSC20K1549 (FI: S. Giacalone; PI: C. Dressing)., We report the discovery in TESS data and validation of HD 56414 b (a.k.a. TOI-1228 b), a Neptune-size (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 3.71 ± 0.20 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>) planet with a 29 day orbital period transiting a young (age = 420 ± 140 Myr) A-type star in the TESS southern continuous-viewing zone. HD 56414 is one of the hottest stars (T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 8500 ± 150 K) to host a known sub-Jovian planet. HD 56414 b lies on the boundary of the hot Neptune desert in the planet radius-bolometric insolation flux space, suggesting that the planet may be experiencing mass loss. To explore this, we apply a photoevaporation model that incorporates the high near-ultraviolet continuum emission of A-type stars. We find that the planet can retain most of its atmosphere over the typical 1 Gyr main-sequence lifetime of an A-type star if its mass is ≥8 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>. Our model also predicts that close-in Neptune-size planets with masses &lt;14 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> are susceptible to total atmospheric stripping over 1 Gyr, hinting that the hot Neptune desert, which has been previously observed around FGKM-type stars, likely extends to A-type stars., Nearly all known exoplanets orbit stars later than spectral type A, and the few known planets orbiting A-type stars are larger than Jupiter. Using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and various ground-based telescopes, we have begun to characterize the population of planets smaller than Jupiter around these hot stars. We present early results from this initiative: (1) the first discovery of a warm Neptune orbiting an A-type star, and (2) a strong tendency for hot Neptune candidates to be false positives. These suggest a dearth of Neptune-size planets at short orbital periods, similar to the ""hot Neptune desert"" observed around cooler stars. This desert is believed to be due to photoevaporation of planetary atmospheres driven by stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photons. However, because most A-type stars lack coronae and therefore emit negligibly in the XUV, a different mechanism must be responsible for the trend we are observing. We explore other explanations for this finding, ranging from photoevaporation driven by less energetic photons to high-eccentricity migration. This work is supported by FINESST Award 80NSSC20K1549 (FI: Steven Giacalone)., The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to probe the atmospheres and surface properties of hot, terrestrial planets via emission spectroscopy. We identify 18 potentially terrestrial planet candidates detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that would make ideal targets for these observations. These planet candidates cover a broad range of planet radii (R <SUB>p</SUB> ~ 0.6-2.0R <SUB>⊕</SUB>) and orbit stars of various magnitudes (K <SUB> s </SUB> = 5.78-10.78, V = 8.4-15.69) and effective temperatures (T <SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000-6000 K). We use ground-based observations collected through the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) and two vetting tools-DAVE and TRICERATOPS-to assess the reliabilities of these candidates as planets. We validate 13 planets: TOI-206 b, TOI-500 b, TOI-544 b, TOI-833 b, TOI-1075 b, TOI-1411 b, TOI-1442 b, TOI-1693 b, TOI-1860 b, TOI-2260 b, TOI-2411 b, TOI-2427 b, and TOI-2445 b. Seven of these planets (TOI-206 b, TOI-500 b, TOI-1075 b, TOI-1442 b, TOI-2260 b, TOI-2411 b, and TOI-2445 b) are ultra-short-period planets. TOI-1860 is the youngest (133 ± 26 Myr) solar twin with a known planet to date. TOI-2260 is a young (321 ± 96 Myr) G dwarf that is among the most metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22 ± 0.06 dex) stars to host an ultra-short-period planet. With an estimated equilibrium temperature of ~2600 K, TOI-2260 b is also the fourth hottest known planet with R <SUB>p</SUB> &lt; 2 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>., The Kepler Space Telescope revolutionized the search for extrasolar planets by discovering thousands of planets with sizes ranging from a fraction of an Earth radius to several Jupiter radii. However, a vast majority of discovered planets orbit stars with masses less than 1.4 times that of the Sun. Kepler focused on these low-mass stars because they are small and slow-rotating, which makes it easier to detect and characterize their transiting planets. By monitoring bright stars across nearly the entire sky, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) allows us to search for transiting planets around a significantly higher number of more massive stars, such as A-type stars. Only a few planets have been found around this type of star, all of which are larger than Jupiter. Uncovering smaller planets, such as those the size of Neptune, would shed new light on how planets form and evolve around hotter, more massive stars. <P />Reaching masses and effective temperatures up to twice those of the Sun, A-type stars subject close-in planets to vastly different environments than their low-mass counterparts, and are therefore an untapped testbed for planet evolution theories. For instance, A-type stars lack a convective interior and therefore lack the ability to spin down via magnetic braking, causing them to rotate significantly faster than the typical planet-hosting star. Because many planet formation and evolution theories are intimately tied to the rotation rate of the host star, this property should lead to discernible features in the planet occurrence rate. In addition, because these hot stars have blackbody-like spectra that extend into the near ultraviolet, they bombard their planets with high-enery photons that can erode their atmospheres via photoevaporation. Photoevaporation is believed to occur around lower mass stars only during the first 100 million years of their lifetimes, but would persist for the entire 1 billion year main sequence lifetime of an A-type star. This would have a profound impact on the occurrence rate of close-in planets, especially Neptune-size planets whose atmospheres are more weakly gravitationally bound than those of Jupiter-size planets. <P />We discuss the ongoing search for Neptune-size planets around A-type stars with TESS as well as the challenges associated with validating planet candidates of this type. In addition, we detail how we plan to calculate the occurrence rate of this class of planet and interpret our results in the context of planet formation and evolution., Validation has played an important role in the discovery of planets detected by TESS. This process of scrutinizing a planet candidate typically involves an analysis of TESS photometry and a combination of different follow-up observations that rule out sources of astrophysical false positives. Despite its usefulness, validation of TESS planet candidates often lacks a robust statistical framework with which to argue for the existence of a planet. We present TRICERATOPS, an easy-to-use tool that resolves this shortcoming using a Bayesian probability calculation. By combining data from TESS and ground-based facilities, our tool quantifies the chance of a transit-like signal originating from both known and unresolved stars located near the potential planet-hosting star on the sky. We display that these quantities reliably predict which candidates are bona fide planets and which candidates are astrophysical false positives, such as nearby eclipsing binaries. We also discuss contexts in which validation with TRICERATOPS is particularly valuable, such as the discovery of planets around stars that make difficult targets for precise radial velocity observations., We present TRICERATOPS, a new Bayesian tool that can be used to vet and validate TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We test the tool on 68 TOIs that have been previously confirmed as planets or rejected as astrophysical false positives. By looking in the false-positive probability (FPP)-nearby false-positive probability (NFPP) plane, we define criteria that TOIs must meet to be classified as validated planets (FPP&lt;0.015 and NFPP&lt;10<SUP>-3</SUP>), likely planets (FPP&lt;0.5 and NFPP&lt;10<SUP>-3</SUP>), and likely nearby false positives (NFPP&gt;10<SUP>-1</SUP>). We apply this procedure on 384 unclassified TOIs and statistically validate 12, classify 125 as likely planets, and classify 52 as likely nearby false positives. Of the 12 statistically validated planets, 9 are newly validated. TRICERATOPS is currently the only TESS vetting and validation tool that models transits from nearby contaminant stars in addition to the target star. We therefore encourage use of this tool to prioritize follow-up observations that confirm bona fide planets and identify false positives originating from nearby stars. <P />(1 data file)., We present TRICERATOPS, a new Bayesian tool that can be used to vet and validate TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs).

TRICERATOPS is currently the only TESS vetting and validation tool that models transits from nearby contaminant stars in addition to the target star. We therefore encourage use of this tool to prioritize follow-up observations that confirm bona fide planets and identify false positives originating from nearby stars., triceratops (Tool for Rating Interesting Candidate Exoplanets and Reliability Analysis of Transits Originating from Proximate Stars) validates planet candidates from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The code calculates the probabilities of a wide range of transit-producing scenarios using the primary transit of the planet candidate and preexisting knowledge of its host and nearby stars. It then uses the known properties of these stars to calculate star-specific priors for each scenario with estimates of stellar multiplicity and planet occurrence rates., There is evidence that protoplanetary disks—including the protosolar one—contain crystalline dust grains on spatial scales where the dust temperature is lower than the threshold value for their formation through thermal annealing of amorphous interstellar silicates. We interpret these observations in terms of an extended, magnetocentrifugally driven disk wind that transports grains from the inner disk—where they are thermally processed by the stellar radiation after being uplifted from the disk surfaces—to the outer disk regions. For any disk radius r, there is a maximum grain size a <SUB>max</SUB>(r) that can be uplifted from that location: grains of size a ≪ a <SUB>max</SUB> are carried away by the wind, whereas those with a ≲ a <SUB>max</SUB> reenter the disk at larger radii. A significant portion of the reentering grains converge to—and subsequently accumulate in—a narrow region just beyond r <SUB>max</SUB>(a), the maximum radius from which grains of size a can be uplifted. We show that this model can account for the inferred crystallinity fractions in classical T Tauri and Herbig Ae disks and for their indicated near constancy after being established early in the disk evolution. It is also consistent with the reported radial gradients in the mean grain size, crystallinity, and crystal composition. In addition, this model yields the properties of the grains that remain embedded in the outflows from protoplanetary disks and naturally explains the inferred persistence of small grains in the surface layers of these disks., In the high-eccentricity migration (HEM) scenario, close-in planets reach the vicinity of the central star on high-eccentricity orbits that become circularized—with a concomitant decrease in the semimajor axis—through a tidal interaction with the star. Giant planets that arrive with periastron distances that are smaller than the Roche limit a<SUB>R</SUB> lose their gaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets' distribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is nonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay. Here, we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario—the existence of a spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization time becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous studies have already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its properties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by tidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor Q<SUB>p</SUB>'). Our work extends these treatments by constructing explicit model distributions for comparison with the data and by carrying out backward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters. We show that circularization generally occurs outside the distribution's inner edge (which defines the boundary of the so-called sub-Jovian desert) and that typically Q<SUB>p</SUB>' ≈ 10<SUP>6</SUP> in the circularization zone (to within a factor of 3). We also find tentative evidence for an eccentricity gradient in lower-mass planets, indicating that formation through HEM may be relevant down to Neptune scales.","['2024arXiv241113363G', '10.3847/1538-3881/ad9587', '10.48550/arXiv.2411.13363', 'arXiv:2411.13363', '2025AJ....169...45G', 'arXiv:2407.21235', '10.48550/arXiv.2407.21235', '2024AJ....168..189G', '2024arXiv240721235G', '10.3847/1538-3881/ad785a', '2024ESS.....560606G', '2024AAS...24332703G', '2023AAS...24115206G', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.06396', 'arXiv:2208.06396', '10.3847/2041-8213/ac80f4', '2022arXiv220806396G', '2022ApJ...935L..10G', '2022BAAS...54e.068G', '2022AJ....163...99G', '2022arXiv220112661G', '10.3847/1538-3881/ac4334', '10.48550/arXiv.2201.12661', 'arXiv:2201.12661', '2021DPS....5321208G', '10.5281/zenodo.5131345', '2021tsc2.confE.161G', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51610024', '2021yCat..51610024G', '10.48550/arXiv.2002.00691', 'arXiv:2002.00691', '10.3847/1538-3881/abc6af', '2020arXiv200200691G', '2021AJ....161...24G', 'ascl:2002.004', '2020ascl.soft02004G', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab311a', '2019ApJ...882...33G', 'arXiv:1907.04961', '10.48550/arXiv.1907.04961', '2019arXiv190704961G', '10.48550/arXiv.1708.07543', '10.3847/1538-3881/aa8c04', 'arXiv:1708.07543', '2017arXiv170807543G', '2017AJ....154..192G']","[('planet', 102), ('star', 84), ('type', 36), ('toi', 24), ('tess', 23), ('hot', 23), ('transiting', 19), ('false', 18), ('positive', 18), ('close', 16)]","[(('type', 'star'), 32), (('false', 'positive'), 18), (('toi', 'toi'), 18), (('occurrence', 'rate'), 11), (('hot', 'jupiter'), 9), (('planet', 'candidate'), 9), (('brown', 'dwarf'), 8), (('size', 'planet'), 8), (('hot', 'star'), 7), (('neptune', 'size'), 7)]","[(('toi', 'toi', 'toi'), 16), (('transiting', 'exoplanet', 'survey'), 6), (('exoplanet', 'survey', 'satellite'), 6), (('survey', 'satellite', 'tess'), 5), (('orbiting', 'type', 'stars'), 4), (('neptune', 'size', 'planets'), 4), (('astrophysical', 'false', 'positives'), 4), (('false', 'positive', 'probability'), 4), (('planets', 'fpp', 'nfpp'), 4), (('nearby', 'false', 'positives'), 4)]",Dirty

These interactions are responsible not only for the dissipation of plasma waves but also for their excitation. The present analysis focuses on two instabilities, mirror and electromagnetic ion cyclotron instabilities, associated with the same proton temperature anisotropy T <SUB>⊥</SUB> &gt; T <SUB>∥</SUB> (where ⊥, ∥ are directions defined with respect to the local magnetic field vector). Theories relying on standard Maxwellian models fail to link these two instabilities (i.e., predicted thresholds) to the proton quasi-stable anisotropies measured in situ in a completely satisfactory manner. Here we revisit these instabilities by modeling protons with the generalized bi-Kappa (bi-κ power-law) distribution, and by a comparative analysis of a 2D hybrid simulation with the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory. It is shown that the two methods feature qualitative and, even to some extent, quantitative agreement. The reduced QL analysis based upon the assumption of a time-dependent bi-Kappa model thus becomes a valuable theoretical approach that can be incorporated into the present studies of solar wind dynamics., We present the design requirements and initial design concept for a Fabry-Ṕerot etalon calibration system for use on the OSIRIS instrument on the Keck I telescope. OSIRIS is an R∼3800 near-infrared integral field spectrograph designed to take images and full spectra over a two-dimensional field. The spectrometer can produce ∼3000 spectra simultaneously, but proper spectral calibration of these data requires a dense grid of spectral lines, which is challenging to achieve with traditional calibration sources. OH lines and arc lines tend to be far apart with large gaps in between at these resolutions. Additionally, the layout of these tightly packed spectra can cause overlap and cross-talk between certain neighboring spectra. Small differences between lenses and thermal instability can also cause fluctuations in the light path, further complicating calibration. We aim to design an etalon that will produce evenly spaced calibration lines at high densities tuned specifically for OSIRIS that can be used to find more accurate wavelength solutions. The etalon lines also provide PSF references that can be used to disentangle confused neighboring spectra. Adding an etalon to the calibration unit on OSIRIS will improve the overall spectral calibration process., We present scattered-light images in the near infrared of the spatially resolved debris disk around HD 110058 in polarized and total intensity using observations from Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). Modern advancements in instrumentation and direct imaging techniques, such as coronagraphy and polarimetry have proven to be valuable tools in studying the structure and composition of debris disks. With near-infrared scattered-light imaging, we can examine the population of some of the smallest dust grains that populate a debris disk, and attempt to probe part of the dynamical history of the planetary system by examining its disk structure. To date, several debris disks have been observed to contain asymmetries and warps. Dynamical interactions between planetesimals, dust, radiation, and possibly planets work in tandem to shape dust into unique morphologies. For HD 110058, we discuss the morphological characteristics of its edge-on debris disk and the methods that will be used to study the disk's dynamical history. The presence of an asymmetric warp in the disk at a radius of 0.35 arcseconds (~38 AU) is revealed in PSF subtracted total intensity images, sharing some characteristics with the disk around 𝛽 Pictoris. The warp suggests the existence of large-scale dynamical perturbations due to a possible unseen planet or other dynamical processes such as stellar flybys. We discuss the results of scattered-light modeling intended to constrain the 3-dimensional morphology of the warp, including semi-major axis and degree of warping to help distinguish between these scenarios., Firehose-like instabilities (FIs) are cited in multiple astrophysical applications. Of particular interest are the kinetic manifestations in weakly collisional or even collisionless plasmas, where these instabilities are expected to contribute to the evolution of macroscopic parameters. Relatively recent studies have initiated a realistic description of FIs, as induced by the interplay of both species, electrons and protons, dominant in the solar wind plasma. This work complements the current knowledge with new insights from linear theory and the first disclosures from 2D-PIC simulations, identifying the fastest growing modes near the instability thresholds and their long-run consequences on the anisotropic distributions. Thus, unlike previous setups, these conditions are favorable to those aperiodic branches that propagate obliquely to the uniform magnetic field, with (maximum) growth rates higher than periodic, quasi-parallel modes. Theoretical predictions are, in general, confirmed by the simulations. The aperiodic electron FI (a-EFI) remains unaffected by the proton anisotropy, and saturates rapidly at low-level fluctuations. Regarding the FI at proton scales, we see a stronger competition between the periodic and aperiodic branches. For the parameters chosen in our analysis, the aperiodic proton FI (a-PFI) is excited before than the periodic proton FI (p-PFI), with the latter reaching a significantly higher fluctuation power. However, both branches are significantly enhanced by the presence of anisotropic electrons. The interplay between EFIs and PFIs also produces a more pronounced proton isotropization., The Center for the Unified Study of Interhemispheric Asymmetries (CUSIA) was elected by NASA to be a Phase 1 DRIVE center. As the name implies, the scientific goal of CUSIA is to study the effects of inter hemispheric asymmetries and to advance the current global model frameworks to better represent these effects. In this talk, I will discuss the current status of CUSIA research and operations, including a brief synopsis of findings to date. I will also describe the current research directions and particular areas for focus during the remainder of Phase 1. Finally, I will describe how the broader community is participating in CUSIA science areas, and how anyone with interests that connect to CUSIA can become involved with the center and leverage CUSIA resources to enhance their own research., As part of ongoing studies by the Center for the Unified Study of Interhemispheric Asymmetries, we have selected an event during which the IMF had a large By component and a positive Bz component, while the solar wind speed and density were steady. This event allows for the study of interhemispheric asymmetries produced by large IMF By at a time when the ring current and the Region 2 current should not be large or dynamically important, as opposed to strongly southward IMF cases when one expects an enhanced ring current. Moreover, the event took place on October 8, 2012, close to equinox. This minimizes conductivity differences between the hemispheres caused by any asymmetry in solar illumination so that the major source of interhemispheric asymmetry will be the IMF By. We have simulated the event with two global MHD codes: LFM and BATS-R-US. We have extensive observations during period in question that are compared to the simulation results. In addition, the simulation results are compared to each other. We will report on these comparisons to benchmark the ability of these codes to replicate magnetospheric structure and dynamics during these solar wind and IMF conditions., NIRSPEC is a high-resolution near-infrared echelle spectrograph on the Keck II telescope that was commissioned in 1999 and upgraded in 2018. This recent upgrade was aimed at improving the sensitivity and longevity of the instrument through the replacement of the spectrometer science detector (SPEC) and slit-viewing camera (SCAM). Commissioning began in 2018 December, producing the first on-sky images used in the characterization of the upgraded system. Through the use of photometry and spectroscopy of standard stars and internal calibration lamps, we assess the performance of the upgraded SPEC and SCAM detectors. First, we evaluate the gain, readnoise, dark current, and the charge persistence of the spec detector. We then characterize the newly upgraded spectrometer and the resulting improvements in sensitivity, including spectroscopic zero points, pixel scale, and resolving power across the spectrometer detector field. Finally, for SCAM, we present zero points, pixel scale, and provide a map of the geometric distortion of the camera., Heat transport in the solar wind is dominated by suprathermal electron populations, i.e., a tenuous halo and a field-aligned beam/strahl, with high energies and antisunward drifts along the magnetic field. Their evolution may offer plausible explanations for the rapid decrease of the heat flux with the solar wind expansion, and self-generated instabilities, or so-called ""heat flux instabilities"" (HFIs), are typically invoked to explain this evolution. This Letter provides a unified description of the full spectrum of HFIs, as prescribed by the linear kinetic theory for high beta conditions (β<SUB>e</SUB> ≫ 0.1) and different relative drifts (U) of the suprathermals. HFIs of different natures are examined, i.e., electromagnetic, electrostatic or hybrid, propagating parallel or obliquely to the magnetic field, etc., as well as their regimes of interplay (co-existence) or dominance. These alternative regimes of HFIs complement each other and may be characteristic of different relative drifts of suprathermal electrons and various conditions in the solar wind, e.g., in the slow or fast winds, streaming interaction regions, and interplanetary shocks. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that heat flux regulation may not involve just one but several HFIs, concomitantly or successively in time. Conditions for a single, well-defined instability with major effects on the suprathermal electrons and, implicitly, the heat flux, seem to be very limited. Whistler HFIs are more likely to occur but only for minor drifts (as also reported by recent observations), which may explain a modest implication in their regulation, shown already in quasilinear studies and numerical simulations., The solar wind is slowed and compressed as it flows across the bow shock, and this generates a current that flows on the bow shock, consistent with the compression of the magnetic field. This current must flow across the magnetosheath and close somewhere and deliver the electromagnetic energy generated at the shock to a load in the system. Some of the bow shock current closes through the Chapman-Ferraro currents at the magnetopause, and some closes directly through the ionosphere on open field lines. The amount of current that can reach the ionosphere is strongly dependent on the amount of merging that takes places, which opens field lines and allows the current to reach the ionosphere, and where it takes place. We will present observations that support the following conclusions. For southward IMF and irrespective of the sign or magnitude of IMF By, bow shock current closure at the magnetopause and in the ionosphere occurs on both open and closed field lines, while for northward IMF, bow shock current closure at the magnetopause and in the ionosphere occurs primarily across closed field lines. More bow shock current is able to reach the ionosphere for southward IMF than for northward IMF, but the current densities are approximately the same., In collision-poor plasmas from space, e.g., solar wind or stellar outflows, the heat flux carried by the strahl or beaming electrons is expected to be regulated by the self-generated instabilities. Recently, simultaneous field and particle observations have indeed revealed enhanced whistler-like fluctuations in the presence of counter-beaming populations of electrons, connecting these fluctuations to the whistler heat-flux instability (WHFI). This instability is predicted only for limited conditions of electron beam-plasmas, and has not yet been captured in numerical simulations. In this Letter we report the first simulations of WHFI in particle-in-cell setups, realistic for the solar wind conditions, and without temperature gradients or anisotropies to trigger the instability in the initiation phase. The velocity distributions have a complex reaction to the enhanced whistler fluctuations conditioning the instability saturation by a decrease of the relative drifts combined with induced (effective) temperature anisotropies (heating the core electrons and pitch-angle and energy scattering the strahl). These results are in good agreement with a recent quasilinear approach, and support therefore a largely accepted belief that WHFI saturates at moderate amplitudes. In the anti-sunward direction the strahl becomes skewed with a pitch-angle distribution decreasing in width as electron energy increases, which seems to be characteristic of self-generated whistlers and not to small-scale turbulence., We report the first results from particle-in-cell simulations of the fast-growing aperiodic electron firehose instability driven by the anisotropic bi-Kappa distributed electrons. Such electrons characterize space plasmas, e.g., solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. Predictions made by the linear theory for full wave-frequency and wave-vector spectra of instabilities are confirmed by the simulations showing that only the aperiodic branch develops at oblique angles with respect to the magnetic field direction. Angles corresponding to the peak magnetic field fluctuating power spectrum increase with the increase in the anisotropy and with the decrease in the inverse power-law index κ. The instability saturation and later nonlinear evolutions are also dominated by the oblique fluctuations, which are enhanced by the suprathermals and trigger a faster relaxation of the anisotropic electrons. Diffusion in velocity space is stimulated by the growing fluctuations, which scatter the electrons, starting with the more energetic suprathermal populations, as appears already before the saturation. After saturation the fluctuating magnetic field power shows decay patterns in the wave-vector space and a shift toward lower angles of propagation., The Chapman-Ferraro current flows along the magnetopause and seperates the geomagnetic field from the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the magnetosheath. In this presentation we discuss the fact that except in the case of purely northward or zero IMF, a portion of the Chapman-Ferraro current must flow in the magnetosheath. We will present THEMIS observations of the external Chapman-Ferraro current and discuss how the distrubition of the current affects force balance and the dissipation of solar wind energy for different solar wind conditions. We will also examine the issue of current closure for the external Chapman-Ferraro current, and compare the observed current densities at the magnetopause to observations of the current density on the bow shock., An argument is presented to support the view that the rate of merging between the geomagnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic field across the dayside magnetosphere is controlled primarily by the solar wind parameters. The controlling parameters are the solar wind electric field in the Earth's frame of reference and the solar wind magnetosonic fast mode Mach number. These factors control to first order the total amount of magnetic flux that is carried by the magnetosheath flow to the dayside merging region. We argue that the global dayside merging rate is governed by the amount of flux that is delivered to the dayside merging line by the magnetosheath flow. The ionospheric conductance also plays an important role by modulating the shape of the magnetospheric obstacle around which the magnetosheath flow is deflected. The local conditions at the magnetopause, especially changes in magnetospheric plasma density will affect the local reconnection rate, but not the global dayside merging rate because to change the global merging rate the entire pattern of magnetosheath flow must be changed. The conceptual model presented here can explain how dayside merging depends on solar wind values, including both linear and nonlinear dependencies, through the application of a single, unifying perspective, without the need for ad hoc mechanisms that limit the dayside merging rate., The Multi-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) mode of LIRIS was used to map the near-IR stellar outflow HH 223, in the dark cloud Lynds 723 (L723). HH 223 spatially coincides with the east-west component of the L723 quadrupolar CO outflow. The radio continuum source SMA2, towards the center of the quadrupolar CO outflow, hides the YSO that seems to power both the near-IR and the CO outflows. To map the S-shaped, near-IR emission of HH 223, extending ∼ 5', an appropriate mask was designed, with 16 rectangular slitlets. J, H and K-band spectra (R ∼eq 2500) were obtained through the mask. The kinematics of the neutral (H<SUB>2</SUB>) and ionized ([FeII]) gas outflow was derived from these data. The results confirm that both the near-IR and the CO outflows have a common driving source. To our knowledge, this is the first use of the MOS-LIRIS observing mode with the mask designed ad hoc to fit several extended, nonaligned targets., We have conducted simulations of the response of the geospace system to a sudden change in the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamic code. Specifically, we have explored a sudden change in the IMF orientation from an extended period during which it was steady northward, to a steady southward IMF. The change in the IMF orientation first causes a reversal in the direction of the bow shock current, which launches a fast mode wave that propagates through the system, causing changes in the overall current pattern even before the southward IMF arrives at the dayside magnetopause to initiate low latitude merging. When the southward IMF does arrive at the magnetopause, the preceding northward IMF in the solar wind flow is still driving high latitude merging poleward of the cusp. Even when the two-cell convection pattern in the ionosphere becomes the dominant convection, the LFM results show that there is still some remnant of the high latitude reverse cell convection that is associated with northward IMF that had previously merged with the geomagnetic field and which takes some time to be cleared out of the system. We will present a detailed account of the timescales and changes in the magnetic topologies, current systems, magnetospheric plasma flows, and ionospheric potential patterns associated with the transition from northward to southward IMF. We will also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the effect of transient changes in IMF orientations., Changes in the Dst index, or the similarly constructed high-resolution SYM-H index, are thought to indicate changes in the total energy content of the ring current. However, this is not always the case. In this paper we examine an intense (SYM-H ∼ -435 nT) magnetic storm that occurred on March 31, 2001. The arrival at Earth of strongly southward IMF produced an immediate negative response in the SYM-H index. While energetic particle and magnetometer data from geosynchronous orbit and inner magnetosphere energetic neutral atom imaging indicate that two substorm injections took place during the main phase, there was about one hour when the SYM-H decreased more than 200 nT with no evidence in the data for ring current enhancement. Instead the near-Earth magnetotail exhibited a growth phase indicative of a strong, growing cross-tail current, with the large substorm expansion phase and the associated injection of energetic particles coming significantly later. Data from the DMSP spacecraft demonstrate that the polar cap flux grew rapidly in response to the strongly southward IMF. We present observations showing that the decrease in SYM-H occurred when polar cap flux was increasing and there was no evidence of injection into the ring current. Our findings strongly support the relationship between Dst and the polar cap flux proposed by theoretical studies that determined that the tail current system could be a significant contributor to Dst., In this work, we derive the full 3D kinematics of the near-infrared outflow HH 223, located in the dark cloud Lynds 723 (L723), where a well-defined quadrupolar CO outflow is found. HH 223 appears projected on to the two lobes of the east-west CO outflow. The radio continuum source VLA 2, towards the centre of the CO outflow, harbours a multiple system of low-mass young stellar objects. One of the components has been proposed to be the exciting source of the east-west CO outflow. From the analysis of the kinematics, we get further evidence on the relationship between the near-infrared and CO outflows and on the location of their exciting source. The proper motions were derived using multi-epoch, narrow-band H<SUB>2</SUB> (2.122 μm line) images. Radial velocities were derived from the 2.122 μm line of the spectra. Because of the extended (∼5 arcmin), S-shaped morphology of the target, the spectra were obtained with the multi-object-spectroscopy (MOS) observing mode using the instrument Long-Slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph (LIRIS) at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope. To our knowledge, this work is the first time that MOS observing mode has been successfully used in the near-infrared range for an extended target., The general view is that the response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system to a complex, variable solar wind input will be a complicated and nonlinear function of that input. We investigate this question using a global MHD code to simulate the interaction and determine the responses of the system to isolated aspects of the solar wind input. We present evidence from the simulations that the solar wind-geospace interaction can be linearly decomposed into component merging interactions for interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> separate from B<SUB>z</SUB> and a separate viscous interaction. One can run the global simulation (in our case, the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry code) using just the solar wind plasma and B<SUB>z</SUB> time series, do a second simulation using just the solar wind plasma and B<SUB>y</SUB> time series, add the results of the two simulation outputs, then subtract the output from a simulation done with only the plasma input and no magnetic field, since the sum of the B<SUB>y</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB> runs has two viscous interactions (one for each run), and get an output that is very close to the result of a single run using the entire IMF merging field (B<SUB>y</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB>) along with the plasma time series. This demonstrates that the components of merging and viscous interactions between the solar wind and geospace are linearly separable to a very large degree., Several factors make observational astronomy difficult for astronomers; one of them is the atmosphere. The light that a star emits is refracted when it goes through the earth's atmosphere; the result of this is that the image of a punctual star is not what the physics would lead us to expect. At the Instituto de Astronomia of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México (IA-UNAM) an instrument has been developed called ""Berkut"", which uses a high resolution technique to improve these effects and obtain interesting and valuable scientific studies. In this paper we present the mechanical reengineering and acceptance test of Berkut. This instrument was design for taking images of high resolution. Essentially, it is composed by a set basic optics which is aligned and in focus with a 1- meter class telescope. It has its own electronic components for controlling remotely a filter wheel; that allows the exchange of the filters according to the requirements of the observer, a couple of objectives mounted in a translation stage, and a CCD camera for acquiring several images per second that are used in the speckle interferometry technique. A project like Berkut needs to be multidisciplinary; astronomy, engineering, optics, mechanics, electronics, and image processing are some of the areas of knowledge used. Berkut will be used in the telescope of the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in Tonantzintla, located in the state of Puebla, Mexico, but it can be used in any telescope 1 meter class. It is pretended to build another Berkuts for being used simultaneously in different telescopes, so it is important to keep the costs as low as possible. With this instrument we pretend to confirm the Hipparcos catalogue of binary stars besides finding exoplanets., In general, the transpolar potential is created by the solar wind through merging and viscous interactions with the Geospace system. The magnitude of the transpolar potential should be the same in both hemispheres, barring significant interhemispheric field-aligned potential drops. This is because merging must produce the same amount of change in the polar cap flux per unit time in both hemispheres, and the viscous interaction operates on closed field lines. We will present evidence from data and from simulations indicating that when the interplanetary magnetic field is large, there can be significant interhemispheric asymmetries in the magnitude of both the transpolar potential and Birkeland current. We will also discuss possible causes for this asymmetry and the relationship to process at the bow shock and in the magnetosheath., The complexity of space endeavors has increased the need for Knowledge Management (KM) tools. The concept of KM involves not only the electronic storage of knowledge, but also the process of making this knowledge available, reusable and traceable. Establishing a KM concept within the Concurrent Engineering Facility (CEF) has been a research topic of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). This paper presents the current KM tools of the CEF: the Software Platform for Organizing and Capturing Knowledge (S.P.O.C.K.), the data model Virtual Satellite (VirSat), and the Simulation Model Library (SimMoLib), and how their usage improved the Concurrent Engineering (CE) process. This paper also exposes the lessons learned from the introduction of KM practices into the CEF and elaborates a roadmap for the further development of KM in CE activities at DLR. The results of the application of the Knowledge Management tools have shown the potential of merging the three software platforms with their functionalities, as the next step towards the fully integration of KM practices into the CE process. VirSat will stay as the main software platform used within a CE study, and S.P.O.C.K. and SimMoLib will be integrated into VirSat. These tools will support the data model as a reference and documentation source, and as an access to simulation and calculation models. The use of KM tools in the CEF aims to become a basic practice during the CE process. The settlement of this practice will result in a much more extended knowledge and experience exchange within the Concurrent Engineering environment and, consequently, the outcome of the studies will comprise higher quality in the design of space systems., General formulations of the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere include the Chapman-Ferraro scaling when considering how the transpolar potential should vary with planetary dipole moment. To first order, the the size of the magnetosphere will scale with the cube root of the dipole moment, and so the geoeffective length (the projection in the solar wind of the dayside merging line) should scale in the same manner. We have conducted a series of numerical experiments using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamic simulation code, changing the magnitude of the Earth's dipole moment over a range of a factor of 20. While the magnetosphere as a whole exhibits the Chapman-Ferraro scaling that one would expect from simple pressure balance, the behavior of the transpolar potential does not correspond to the simple picture. This is because the geoeffective length in the simulation does not scale according to simple pressure balance. We will explain this result in the context of the magnetosheath force balance model in which the geoeffective length is determined by the forces on the magnetosheath flow., HH 223 is the optical counterpart of a larger scale H<SUB>2</SUB> outflow, driven by the protostellar source VLA 2A, in L723. Its poorly collimated and rather chaotic morphology suggested Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) as an appropriate option to map the emission in order to derive the physical conditions and kinematics. Here we present new results based on IFS observations made with the INTEGRAL system at the William Herschel Telescope. The brightest knots of HH 223 (∼16 arcsec, ≃0.02 pc at a distance of 300 pc) were mapped with a single pointing in the spectral range 6200-7700 Å. We obtained emission-line intensity maps for Hα, [N II] 6584 Å and [S II] 6716, 6731 Å and explored the distribution of the excitation and electron density from [N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα and [S II] 6716/6731 line-ratio maps. Maps of the radial velocity field were obtained. We analysed the three-dimensional kinematics by combining the knot radial velocities derived from IFS data with the knot proper motions derived from multi-epoch narrow-band images. The intensity maps built from IFS data reproduced the morphology found in the narrow-band images well. We checked the results obtained from previous long-slit observations with those derived from IFS spectra extracted with a similar spatial sampling. At the positions intersected by the slit, the physical conditions and kinematics derived from IFS are compatible with those derived from long-slit data. In contrast, significant discrepancies were found when the results from long-slit data were compared with the ones derived from IFS spectra extracted at positions shifted a few arcsec from those intersected by the slit. This clearly revealed IFS observations as the best choice to obtain a reliable picture of the HH emission properties., In this paper we examine the role of dayside merging between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the geomagnetic field in the generation of the polar cap potential in the ionosphere during the Whole Heliospheric Interval using the Coupled Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere (CMIT) and Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global simulations of the geospace system from the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM). We isolate the portion of the total ionospheric potential due to the viscous interaction by simulating the interval with a zero IMF, but with the same solar wind plasma conditions. For southward IMF, the cross polar cap potential is the sum of the merging potential and the viscous potential, so we can determine the merging potential by subtracting the viscous potential from the total potential. From the dependence of the merging potential on southward IMF we calculate a geoeffective length of 5 R<SUB>E</SUB>. For northward IMF the situation is more complicated since the cross polar cap potential, defined as the peak to peak potential, will be almost always either the value of the viscous potential or of the merging potential, whichever is larger. We find that during periods of northward IMF the cross polar cap potential can be less than what the viscous interaction would produce with no IMF present. This means that the viscous interaction is weakened by the cycle of merging and reconnection for northward IMF. Our results also indicate that current representations of merging rates or electric fields are flawed in the manner in which they describe northward IMF. Typical representations simply produce a weak reconnection rate when the IMF is northward that adds to the viscous potential to create a cross polar cap potential that is larger than the viscous potential, whereas the effect of merging for northward IMF reduces the viscous interaction so that the cross polar cap potential for moderate northward IMF values is smaller than the value that would

However, crowding and high levels of dust extinction have prevented a complete understanding of these populations and the Galactic structures they comprise. For example, it is well established that the Milky Way hosts a galactic bar, but its mass distribution and orbital structure is poorly constrained. Furthermore, the extension of the Galactic halo's stellar density profile towards the inner Galaxy is highly debated, including whether the Milky Way hosts a classical bulge. By applying novel methods to the large surveys available now (Gaia) and in the future (SDSS-V, and Roman), we can bring new insight into the inner Galaxy's stellar distributions and kinematics. In this poster, I present new work constraining the inner Galaxy's structure using Gaia DR3 data. I also make use of FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies in order to interpret and compare the observations to predictions. Altogether, this work improves our understanding of the Milky Way's early evolution by illuminating the structures that have formed in its center., For 182815672 stars with XP spectra that were released in Gaia DR3, we present the derived probability that the star is enhanced in carbon ([C/Fe]&gt;+0.7). <P />(2 data files)., The oldest stars in our Galaxy contain crucial information about its formation and the early Universe. Simulations predict that the oldest stars are likely to be located in the central regions of galaxies. Furthermore, nucleosynthetic predictions for the first stars indicate large yields of carbon, suggesting that the oldest stars may be Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars. Studying the chemo-dynamical properties of metal-poor inner Galaxy stars and CEMP stars can illuminate their origins and, in turn, inform our models of first star formation and galaxy evolution. For part of my dissertation, I completed a three-part survey entitled Chemical Origins of Metal-poor Bulge Stars (COMBS). COMBS I and COMBS III focused on the chemical abundance analysis of ~600 metal-poor stars using VLT/FLAMES spectra, while COMBS II focused on the dynamics of these stars. These studies show evidence that the population, which enriched the old metal-poor inner Galaxy stars, had a more top-heavy IMF than the typical Milky Way. Furthermore, my results indicate that secular disk evolution may be more important in early galaxy evolution than previously thought. However, the COMBS survey did not detect any CEMP stars in the inner Galaxy. To investigate this further, I used machine learning to identify an all-sky sample of millions of CEMP stars using Gaia DR3. In addition, my thesis put new constraints on the length and pattern speed of the Milky Way's bar by developing a novel orbit integration method, which in turn, improves the precision and accuracy of inner Galaxy dynamical analysis. In total, my dissertation brought new insights into the formation of the Galaxy, especially the bulge, and provided constraints on the formation of the first stars through the chemo-dynamics of ancient stars., The dynamics of the inner Galaxy contain crucial clues for untangling the evolutionary history of the Milky Way. However, the gravitational potential of the inner Galaxy is poorly constrained, partly because the precise structure of the Galactic bar is unknown. Specifically, the length of the Galactic bar is currently under debate with length estimates ranging from 3.5-5 kpc. Here, I present a novel method for constraining the length and pattern speed of the Galactic bar using the 6D phase space information of ~210,000 stars from Gaia/APOGEE to directly integrate orbits of Milky Way bar stars. First, I use N-body simulations to validate the method, and then I apply it to APOGEE DR17 and Gaia eDR3 data. I find that the orbit-derived bar length is self-consistent with the potential's bar length only when the structure of the gravitational potential is similar to the N-body model from which the initial positions and velocities of the stars are taken. When I apply the method to the observed data, I expect to find a self-consistent bar length only for a potential that is representative of the APOGEE and Gaia data, i.e., the actual Galactic bar mass distribution. With my method, I can test a variety of potential models and determine which potentials best fit the observed data for the Galactic bar. In this talk, I will present new constraints on the length and pattern speed of the Galactic bar and the potential of the inner Galaxy., Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observator y under ESO programme: 089.B-069. <P />(1 data file)., Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programme: 089.B-069 <P />(1 data file)., The metal-poor stars in the bulge are important relics of the Milky Way's formation history, as simulations predict that they are some of the oldest stars in the Galaxy. In order to determine if they are truly ancient stars, we must understand the origins of this population. Currently, it is unclear if the metal-poor stars in the bulge ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) are merely halo interlopers, a unique accreted population, part of the boxy/peanut-shaped (B/P) bulge or a classical bulge population. In this work, we use spectra from the VLT/FLAMES spectrograph to obtain metallicity estimates using the Ca-II triplet (CaT) of 473 bulge stars (187 of which have [Fe/H]&lt;-1 dex), targeted using SkyMapper photometry. We also use Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions to infer the Galactic positions and velocities along with orbital properties for 523 bulge stars. We employ a probabilistic orbit analysis and find that about half of our sample has a &gt; 50% probability of being bound to the bulge, and half are halo interlopers. Our examination of the kinematics of the confined compared to the unbound stars indicates the metal-poor bulge ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) comprises at least two populations; those confined to the boxy/peanut bulge and halo stars passing through the inner galaxy. We conclude that an orbital analysis approach, as we have employed, is important to uncover and understand the composite nature of the metal-poor stars in the inner region., We selected red clump stars from the 200 million stars which have photometry from 2MASS (Cat. II/246), AllWISE (Cat. II/328), Gaia (Cat. I/345), and Pan-STARRS (Cat. II/349). We derive the Teff, logg, {DELTA}ν, and {DELTA}P of these stars from 13 bands of photometry and parallax using a mixture density network. <P />(1 data file)., Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO programme: 089.B-069 <P />(3 data files).","['2024AAS...24310701L', '2023yCat..75234049L', '2023AAS...24142102L', '2022DDA....5340001L', '2021yCat..75090122L', '2021yCat..75015981L', '2021AAS...23732203L', '2020yCat..74953087L', '2020yCat..74882283L']","[('star', 33), ('galaxy', 20), ('bar', 12), ('bulge', 12), ('milky', 10), ('galactic', 10), ('data', 10), ('gaia', 9), ('metal', 9), ('poor', 9)]","[(('metal', 'poor'), 9), (('galactic', 'bar'), 7), (('data', 'file'), 5), (('gaia', 'dr'), 4), (('oldest', 'star'), 4), (('cemp', 'star'), 4), (('poor', 'star'), 4), (('star', 'galaxy'), 3), (('bulge', 'star'), 3), (('length', 'pattern'), 3)]","[(('metal', 'poor', 'stars'), 4), (('length', 'pattern', 'speed'), 3), (('based', 'observations', 'collected'), 3), (('observations', 'collected', 'european'), 3), (('collected', 'european', 'southern'), 3), (('eso', 'programme', 'data'), 3), (('galactic', 'bar', 'mass'), 2), (('bar', 'mass', 'distribution'), 2), (('oldest', 'stars', 'galaxy'), 2), (('simulations', 'predict', 'oldest'), 2)]",Dirty

Our study focuses on approximately 1,200 galaxies (886 central and 332 satellite halos) in the low-mass regime, with stellar masses between $10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We analyze the size-mass relation ($r_{50} - M_{\star}$), inner dark matter mass-stellar mass ($M^{50}_{\rm DM} - M_{\star}$) relation, and the halo mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm halo} - M_{\star}$) relation. At fixed stellar mass, we find the galaxies experiencing stronger tidal influences, indicated by higher Perturbation Indices (PI $&gt;$ 1) are generally larger and have lower masses relative to their counterparts with lower Perturbation Indices (PI $&lt;$ 1). Applying a Random Forest regression model, we show that both the environment (PI) and halo mass ($M_{rm halo}$) are significant predictors of a galaxy's relative size and dark matter content. Notably, because $M_{\rm halo}$ is also strongly affected by the environment, our findings indicate that environmental conditions not only influence galactic sizes and relative inner dark matter content directly, but also indirectly through their impact on halo mass. Our results highlight a critical interplay between environmental factors and halo mass in shaping galaxy properties, affirming the environment as a fundamental driver in galaxy formation and evolution., The radial acceleration relation (RAR) connects the total gravitational acceleration of a galaxy at a given radius, a<SUB>tot</SUB>(r), with that accounted for by baryons at the same radius, a<SUB>bar</SUB>(r). The shape and tightness of the RAR for rotationally-supported galaxies have characteristics in line with MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and can also arise within the cosmological constant + cold dark matter (ΛCDM) paradigm. We use zoom simulations of 20 galaxies with stellar masses of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>7-11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to study the RAR in the FIRE-2 simulations. We highlight the existence of simulated galaxies with non-monotonic RAR tracks that 'hook' down from the average relation. These hooks are challenging to explain in Modified Inertia theories of MOND, but naturally arise in all of our ΛCDM-simulated galaxies that are dark-matter dominated at small radii and have feedback-induced cores in their dark matter haloes. We show, analytically and numerically, that downward hooks are expected in such cored haloes because they have non-monotonic acceleration profiles. We also extend the relation to accelerations below those traced by disc galaxy rotation curves. In this regime, our simulations exhibit 'bends' off of the MOND-inspired extrapolation of the RAR, which, at large radii, approach a<SUB>tot</SUB> ≈ a<SUB>bar</SUB>/f<SUB>b</SUB>, where f<SUB>b</SUB> is the cosmic baryon fraction. Future efforts to search for these hooks and bends in real galaxies will provide interesting tests for MOND and ΛCDM., We use a suite of 12 simulations of MW-mass galaxies run with the FIRE feedback implementation to explore the relationship between the properties of a galaxy's stellar population and that of its dark matter (DM) component at small galactocentric radii. We show that the mass in stars within 1 kiloparsec (kpc) is a good predictor for both DM mass and density within the same region as well as the slope of the radial DM density profile from 1-5 kpc. This relationship holds for galaxies with central stellar masses (r &lt; 1 kpc) between 10<SUP>7</SUP>-10<SUP>10.5</SUP> solar masses. We predict a similar relationship between the central stellar mass component and the shape of the dissipationless mass (stars + DM) profile. Finally, we use dynamical properties of the simulated galaxies' stellar components in conjunction with those predicted for the Milky Way (MW) using observational data to predict what the MW's central DM content should look like., We explore the origin of stellar metallicity gradients in simulated and observed dwarf galaxies. We use FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between 10<SUP>5.5</SUP> and 10<SUP>8.6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady 'puffing' of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the 'puffing' process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects., We utilize the hydrodynamic simulation code GIZMO to construct a non-cosmological idealized dwarf galaxy built to match the parameters of the observed Pegasus dwarf galaxy. This simulated galaxy will be used in a series of tests in which we will implement different methods of removing the dwarf’s gas in order to emulate the ram pressure stripping mechanism encountered by dwarf galaxies as they fall into more massive companion galaxies. These scenarios will be analyzed in order to determine the role that the removal of gas plays in rotational vs. dispersion support (Vrot/σ) of our galaxy., We utilize a suite of 75 different simulations of major mergers based on the ""Feedback in Realistic Environments"" FIRE model (Hopkins et al. 2014). The suite consists of mergers of disk galaxies with mass ratio of 2.5:1, set at various eccentricities, impact parameters and relative spin-orbit orientations. This work focuses on the evolution of the size of the stellar, gaseous and star-forming components. We find that, whilst older models (based on Springel &amp; Hernquist 2003) predict dramatic size evolution - this effect is mild for the newer FIRE simulations. We believe this is due to the fact that newer simulations produce weaker gravitational tidal torques.","['arXiv:2501.04084', '2025arXiv250104084M', '10.48550/arXiv.2501.04084', '2023arXiv230709507M', 'arXiv:2307.09507', '10.48550/arXiv.2307.09507', '2024MNRAS.530.1349M', '10.1093/mnras/stae819', '2022AAS...24021606M', 'arXiv:2009.01241', '10.48550/arXiv.2009.01241', '2021MNRAS.501.5121M', '2020arXiv200901241M', '2020MNRAS.tmp.3713M', '10.1093/mnras/staa3958', '2017AAS...22914518M', '2016AAS...22734211M']","[('galaxy', 32), ('mass', 22), ('stellar', 18), ('simulation', 10), ('halo', 10), ('star', 10), ('gradient', 9), ('dark', 8), ('matter', 8), ('dwarf', 8)]","[(('dark', 'matter'), 8), (('stellar', 'mass'), 8), (('simulated', 'galaxy'), 6), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 6), (('halo', 'mass'), 4), (('galaxy', 'stellar'), 4), (('stellar', 'metallicity'), 4), (('metallicity', 'gradient'), 4), (('metal', 'rich'), 4), (('matter', 'content'), 3)]","[(('dark', 'matter', 'content'), 3), (('stellar', 'metallicity', 'gradients'), 3), (('size', 'dark', 'matter'), 2), (('mass', 'stellar', 'mass'), 2), (('stellar', 'mass', 'rm'), 2), (('mass', 'rm', 'halo'), 2), (('perturbation', 'indices', 'pi'), 2), (('galaxies', 'stellar', 'masses'), 2), (('simulated', 'galaxies', 'stellar'), 2), (('local', 'group', 'dwarf'), 2)]",Dirty

For a subset of sources, we have obtained molecular absorption spectra (CCH, HNC, HCN, and HCO+) with ALMA to characterize the chemistry of the molecular ISM along the same lines of sight as 21-SPONGE, where we have key constraints on the kinetic temperature, cold gas fraction, and interstellar turbulence. We have detected molecular gas in the direction of some sources, while some sources show no evidence for molecular gas. Both detections and non-detections are used to place constraints on the role of non-equilibrium chemistry in molecule formation, and to test predictions for molecular abundances based on recent MHD models.

These objects represent a potentially widespread class of small bodies that further populate the continuum between asteroids and comets and for which the active nature is inferred from their orbital motion. We report detections of seven dark comets which demonstrate that there are two distinct populations based on their orbits and sizes. These objects represent a class of Solar System objects that may have delivered material to the Earth necessary for the development of life such as volatiles and organics., A 2022 NASEM consensus study report introduced 15 recommendations for ""Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Leadership of Competed Space Missions."" These recommendations were aimed at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, with salient themes including empaneling DEIA positions on advisory councils, and the necessity of demographic data collection across the field. While these points remain important for the consideration of NASA leadership, progress is often facilitated through a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Here we present a set of recommendations (based on the 2022 NASEM report) tailored to promote structural change across various levels of the planetary science community. We separated these recommendations by theme, and created a tiered list of suggested implementation levels affecting funding agencies, institutions, research teams, and/or missions. By categorizing these recommendations, we promote situation-specific strategies and considerations, which lead to more impactful action and policy across the field. With this, we aim to support the bottom-up advancement of DEIA within planetary science leadership, accompanying future top-down efforts to do the same., Small bodies are capable of delivering essential prerequisites for the development of life, such as volatiles and organics, to the terrestrial planets. For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to the Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System. Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects (NEOs) were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these ""dark comets"" display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. We report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects previously classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss, such as outgassing. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of ~10, ~0.1, and ~0.1 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for 1998 FR<SUB>11</SUB>, 2001 ME<SUB>1</SUB>, and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, ""outer"" dark comets on eccentric orbits that may be end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, ""inner"" dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a new population. These objects may allow us to trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, population that may have provided material to the Earth essential for the development of life., Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecrafts. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, μ, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e. μ/ρgR<SUB>p</SUB> &gt; 0.1 for a body with density ρ, surface gravitational acceleration g, and radius Rp, (ii) the surface is not molten, (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy, and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of μ/ρgRp, and find that more than 90% of the core will melt due to this runaway for μ/ρgRp &gt; 1. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5, 50, and 98% SO<SUB>2</SUB> component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a &gt; 3 σ preference for a model with SO<SUB>2</SUB> with 5-10 transits with JWST for L98-59bcd., Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft.

We find a ≳3σ preference for a model with SO<SUB>2</SUB> with 5-10 transits with JWST for L 98-59bcd., We report detections of non-radial nongravitational accelerations in a sample of six photometrically inactive objects. We hypothesize that the accelerations are driven by outgassing and calculate implied H2O production rates for each object., We report statistically significant detections of nonradial, nongravitational accelerations based on astrometric data in the photometrically inactive objects 1998 KY<SUB>26</SUB>, 2005 VL<SUB>1</SUB>, 2016 NJ<SUB>33</SUB>, 2010 VL<SUB>65</SUB>, 2016 RH<SUB>120</SUB>, and 2010 RF<SUB>12</SUB>. The magnitudes of the nongravitational accelerations are greater than those typically induced by the Yarkovsky effect, and there is no radiation-based, nonradial effect that can be so large. Therefore, we hypothesize that the accelerations are driven by outgassing and calculate implied H<SUB>2</SUB>O production rates for each object. We attempt to reconcile outgassing-induced acceleration with the lack of visible comae or photometric activity via the absence of surface dust and low levels of gas production. Although these objects are small, and some are rapidly rotating, the surface cohesive forces are stronger than the rotational forces, and rapid rotation alone cannot explain the lack of surface debris. It is possible that surface dust was removed previously, perhaps via outgassing activity that increased the rotation rates to their present-day value. We calculate dust production rates of order ~10<SUP>-4</SUP> g s<SUP>-1</SUP> in each object, assuming that the nuclei are bare, within the upper limits of dust production from a sample stacked image of 1998 KY<SUB>26</SUB> of ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{Dust}}\lt 0.2$ g s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This production corresponds to brightness variations of order ~0.0025%, which are undetectable in extant photometric data. We assess the future observability of each of these targets and find that the orbit of 1998 KY<SUB>26</SUB>-which is also the target of the extended Hayabusa2 mission-exhibits favorable viewing geometry before 2025., Minor bodies have always held the keys to unraveling the mysteries of planetary systems. Within the solar system, they have opened windows into our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system planets. The discoveries of the first two interstellar minor bodies 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, provide a chance to obtain new constraints on the formation location of planetesimals ejected from extrasolar systems and the occurrence rate and dynamical evolution of exoplanets responsible for their ejection. In this talk, I will discuss the potential that these measurements offer to inform exoplanetary formation and composition in the era of JWST and LSST. I will describe how future measurements of the production rates of H<SUB>2</SUB>O, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and CO in interstellar comets can be used to estimate their carbon-to-oxygen ratios, which trace formation locations within their original protoplanetary disks. I will also demonstrate that interstellar comet analogues that form in distant regions of exoplanetary system can provide significant metal enrichment to short period exoplanetary atmospheres, which are potentially observable in upcoming JWST observations., The discovery of the first two interstellar objects implies that, on average, every star contributes a substantial amount of material to the galactic population by ejecting such bodies from the host system. Because scattering is a chaotic process, a comparable amount of material should be injected into the inner regions of each system that ejects comets. For comets that are transported inwards and interact with planets, this Letter estimates the fraction of material that is accreted or outward-scattered as a function of planetary masses and orbital parameters. These calculations indicate that planets with escape velocities smaller than their current-day orbital velocities will efficiently accrete comets. We estimate the accretion efficiency for members of the current census of extrasolar planets and find that planetary populations including but not limited to hot and warm Jupiters, sub-Neptunes, and super-Earths can efficiently capture incoming comets. This cometary enrichment may have important ramifications for postformation atmospheric composition and chemistry. As a result, future detections and compositional measurements of interstellar comets will provide direct measurements of material that potentially enriched a subpopulation of the extrasolar planets. Finally, we estimate the efficiency of this enrichment mechanism for extrasolar planets that will be observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With JWST currently operational and these observations imminently forthcoming, it is of critical importance to investigate how enrichment from interstellar comet analogs may affect the interpretations of exoplanet atmospheric compositions., Since 2017, two macroscopic interstellar objects have been discovered in the inner Solar System, both of which are distinct in nature. The first interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, passed within $\sim63$ lunar distances of the Earth, appeared asteroidal lacking detectable levels of gas or dust loss, yet exhibited a nongravitational acceleration. 1I/`Oumuamua's brief visit left open questions regarding its provenance which has given rise to many theoretical hypotheses, including an icy comet lacking a dust coma, an elongated fragment of a planet or planetesimal that was tidally disrupted, and an ultra-porous fractal aggregate. The second interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, was distinct from 1I/`Oumuamua in terms of its bulk physical properties and displayed a definitive cometary tail. We review the discoveries of these objects, the subsequent observations and characterizations, and the theoretical hypotheses regarding their origins. We describe 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov in the context of active asteroids and comets in the Solar System. The discovery of these two objects implies a galactic-wide population of $\sim10^{26}$ similar bodies. Forthcoming observatories should detect many more interstellar planetesimals which may offer new insights into how planetary formation processes vary throughout the Galaxy., Based on the occurrence rates implied by the discoveries of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, the forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) should detect ≥one interstellar object every year. We advocate for future measurements of the production rates of H<SUB>2</SUB>O, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and CO in these objects to estimate their carbon-to-oxygen ratios, which trace formation locations within their original protoplanetary disks. We review similar measurements for solar system comets, which indicate formation interior to the CO snow line. By quantifying the relative processing in the interstellar medium and solar system, we estimate that production rates will not be representative of primordial compositions for the majority of interstellar comets. Preferential desorption of CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB> relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the interstellar medium implies that measured C/O ratios represent lower limits on the primordial ratios. Specifically, production rate ratios of Q(CO)/Q(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) &lt; 0.2 and Q(CO)/Q(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) &gt; 1 likely indicate formation interior and exterior to the CO snow line, respectively. The high C/O ratio of 2I/Borisov implies that it formed exterior to the CO snow line. We provide an overview of the currently operational facilities capable of obtaining these measurements that will constrain the fraction of ejected comets that formed exterior to the CO snow line. This fraction will provide key insights into the efficiency of and mechanisms for cometary ejection in exoplanetary systems., Minor bodies have opened windows into our understanding of the solar system planets' formation and evolution. The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt led to the discovery that seemingly immutable solar system bodies were chaotic, and the discovery of the Kuiper belt led to the realization that the giant planets underwent a transient period of violent instability. The discoveries of the first two interstellar minor bodies, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, provided a chance to obtain new constraints on the formation location of ejected planetesimals and the occurrence rate and dynamical evolution of extrasolar planets responsible for their ejection. The forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) should detect ≥3 interstellar comets every year. We advocate for future measurements of the carbon to oxygen ratio in these comets, which traces formation location within the original protostellar disk. We review similar measurements for solar system comets, which indicate formation interior to the CO snowline. By comparing cometary C/O ratios calculated with various molecular species, we argue that measurements of H<SUB>2</SUB>O, CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CO should be prioritized for interstellar comets. We quantify the extent to which these measurements probe the primordial composition of an interstellar comet as a function of age and trajectory, by calculating the relative change in diameter via erosion in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We estimate that ~60% of 'Oumuamua-like and ~10% of Borisov-like interstellar objects detected by the LSST will exhibit cometary activity representative of the primordial composition. By accounting for uncertainties and scatter in previously measured cometary and stellar C/O ratios, we estimate that these measurements for ≥5 objects will reveal a formation location interior or exterior to the CO snowline of ejected comets. Based on the anomalously high C/O ratio of 2I/Borisov and C/2016 R2 with respect to typical solar system comets, we argue that comets ejected via giant planet scattering largely form exterior to the CO snowline, while the remnant and bound H<SUB>2</SUB>O dominated population formed interior to the CO snowline. We provide an overview of the currently operational and forthcoming facilities capable of producing these measurements which will test this hypothesis and provide key insights into the efficiency of and mechanisms for cometary ejection in exoplanetary systems., `Oumuamua (I1 2017) was the first macroscopic body observed to traverse the inner solar system on an unbound hyperbolic orbit. Its light curve displayed strong periodic variation, and it showed no hint of a coma or emission from molecular outgassing. In this thesis, I briefly outline the consequences that this first detection of an interstellar object implies for the planet and star formation processes, and I assess the near-term prospects for detecting and observing (both remotely and in situ) future Solar System visitors of this type. Astrometric measurements indicate that 'Oumuamua experienced non-gravitational acceleration on its outbound trajectory, but energy balance arguments indicate this acceleration is inconsistent with a water ice sublimation-driven jet of the type exhibited by solar system comets. I show that the 8 hour photometric period and the non-gravitational acceleration of 'Oumuamua can be explained by a nozzle-like venting of volatiles whose activity migrated to track the sub-solar location on the object's surface. I show that all of 'Oumaumua's observed properties can be explained if it contained a significant fraction of molecular hydrogen H<SUB>2</SUB> ice. I show that H<SUB>2</SUB> rich bodies plausibly form in the coldest dense cores of Giant Molecular Cloud Cores. While carbon monoxide (CO) has been dismissed as a possible accelerant because of its non-detection in emission by Spitzer, I show that outgassing from a surface characterized by a modest covering fraction of CO ice can satisfy the non-ballistic dynamics for a plausible range of assumed bulk densities and surface albedos. Spitzer upper limits on CO emission are, however, inconsistent with the CO production necessary to provide the acceleration. Nonetheless, an ad hoc but physically plausible explanation is that the activity level varied greatly during the time that the trajectory was monitored. I reproduce the astrometric analysis presented in Micheli et al. (2018), and verify that the non-gravitational acceleration was consistent with stochastic changes in outgassing., All stars produce explosive surface events such as flares and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of energy stored in coronal magnetic fields, generated by the stellar dynamo. However, it remains unclear if the energy deposition in the magnetic fields is driven by direct or alternating currents. Recently, we presented observational measurements of the flare intensity distributions for a sample of ~10<SUP>5</SUP> stars across the main sequence observed by TESS, all of which exhibited power-law distributions similar to those observed in the Sun, albeit with varying slopes. Here we investigate the mechanisms required to produce such a distribution of flaring events via direct current energy deposition, in which coronal magnetic fields braid, reconnect, and produce flares. We adopt a topological model for this process, which produces a power-law distribution of energetic flaring events. We expand this model to include the Coriolis effect, which we demonstrate produces a shallower distribution of flare energies in stars that rotate more rapidly (corresponding to a weaker decline in occurrence rates toward increasing flare energies). We present tentative evidence for the predicted rotation-power-law index correlation in the observations. We advocate for future observations of stellar flares that would improve our measurements of the power-law exponents, and yield key insights into the underlying dynamo mechanisms that underpin the self-similar flare intensity distributions., The compositional and morphological evolution of minor bodies in the Solar System is primarily driven by the evolution of their heliocentric distances, as the level of incident solar radiation regulates cometary activity. We investigate the dynamical transfer of Centaurs into the inner Solar System, facilitated by mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Saturn. The recently discovered object, P/2019 LD2, will transition from the Centaur region to the inner Solar System in 2063. We demonstrate that a spacecraft stationed near Jupiter would be well-positioned for a rendezvous with LD2, that could orbit match and accompany it as it travels into the inner Solar System. This would provide an opportunity to obtain in situ observations of the onset of intense activity in a pristine comet. In order to contextualize LD2, we perform N-body simulations of a population of Centaurs and Jupiter Family Comets. Objects between Jupiter and Saturn with Tisserand parameter, TJ~3, are transferred onto orbits with perihelia, q&lt;4au, within the next 1000 years with notably high efficiency. Our simulations show that there may be additional LD2-like targets for a rendezvous mission in the near-term future, all of which have low V with respect to Jupiter. We calculate the distribution of orbital elements resulting from a single Jovian encounter and show that objects with initial perihelia close to Jupiter are efficiently scattered to q&lt;4au. Moreover, approximately 55% of the transitioning objects in our simulated population experience at least 1 Jovian encounter prior to reaching q&lt;4au.

Finally, we discuss the prospect of identifying additional targets for in situ measurements with forthcoming observational facilities., The first interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), exhibited several unique properties, including an extreme aspect ratio, a lack of typical cometary volatiles, and a deviation from a Keplerian trajectory. Several authors have hypothesized that the non-gravitational acceleration was caused by either cometary outgassing or radiation pressure. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of 'Oumuamua under the action of high-surface-area fractional activity and radiation pressure. We demonstrate that a series of transient jets that migrate across the illuminated surface will not produce a secular increase in the spin rate. We produce 3D tumbling simulations that approximate the dynamics of a surface-covering jet and show that the resulting synthetic light curve and periodogram are reasonably consistent with the observations. Moreover, we demonstrate that radiation pressure also produces a steady spin state. While carbon monoxide (CO) has been dismissed as a possible accelerant because of its non-detection in emission by Spitzer, we show that outgassing from a surface characterized by a modest covering fraction of CO ice can satisfy the non-ballistic dynamics for a plausible range of assumed bulk densities and surface albedos.

The ability of an object to sustain an aspheroidal shape largely determines whether or not it will exhibit nontrivial rotational behavior. In this work, we adopt a simplified model of a gravitationally interacting primary and satellite pair, where each body's quadrupole moment is approximated by two diametrically opposed point masses. After calculating the net gravitational torque on the satellite from the primary, as well as the associated equations of motion, we employ a Hamiltonian formalism that allows for a perturbative treatment of the spin-orbit and retrograde and prograde spin-spin coupling states. By analyzing the resonances individually and collectively, we determine the criteria for resonance overlap and the onset of chaos, as a function of orbital and geometric properties of the binary. We extend the 2D planar geometry to calculate the obliquity evolution. This calculation indicates that satellites in spin-spin resonances undergo precession when inclined out of the plane, but they do not tumble. We apply our resonance overlap criteria to the contact binary system (216) Kleopatra, and find that its satellites, Cleoselene and Alexhelios, may plausibly be exhibiting chaotic rotational dynamics from the overlap of the spin-orbit and retrograde spin-spin resonances. While this model is, by construction, generalizable to any binary system, it will be particularly useful for studies of small bodies in the Solar System, whose irregular shapes make them ideal candidates for exotic rotational states., Objects in binary systems can experience complex rotation evolution, arising from the extensively studied effect of spin-orbit coupling as well as more nuanced dynamics arising from spin-spin interactions. The ability of an object to sustain a permanent aspheroidal shape largely determines whether or not it will exhibit non-trivial rotational behavior. We propose a simplified model of a gravitationally interacting primary and satellite pair, where each body's quadrupole moment is approximated by two diametrically opposed point masses. After calculating the net gravitational torque on the satellite from the primary, and the associated equations of motion, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism which recovers the spin-orbit and retrograde and prograde spin-spin coupling states. By analyzing the resonances individually and collectively, we determine the criteria for resonance overlap and the onset of chaos, as a function of orbital and geometric properties of the binary. With an analytical 3-dimensional extension of the model, we evaluate the linear stability of each of the resonances with respect to oscillations out of the orbital plane, where instability is a proxy for the onset of non-principle axis tumbling.

In this paper, we present a dynamical study of the disrupting satellite galaxies in the Auriga simulations that are orbiting 28 distinct Milky Way-mass hosts across three resolutions. We find that the satellite galaxy populations are highly disrupted. The majority of satellites that remain fully intact at present day were accreted recently without experiencing more than one pericentre ($n_{\rm peri} \lesssim 1$) and have large apocentres ($r_{\rm apo} \gtrsim 200$ kpc) and pericentres ($r_{\rm peri} \gtrsim 50$ kpc). The remaining satellites have experienced significant tidal disruption and, given full knowledge of the system, would be classified as stellar streams. We find stellar streams in Auriga across the range of pericentres and apocentres of the known Milky Way dwarf galaxy streams and, interestingly, overlapping significantly with the Milky Way intact satellite population. We find no significant change in satellite orbital distributions across resolution. However, we do see substantial halo-to-halo variance of $(r_\text{peri}, r_\text{apo})$ distributions across host galaxies, as well as a dependence of satellite orbits on host halo mass - systems disrupt at larger pericentres and apocentres in more massive hosts. Our results suggest that either cosmological simulations (including, but not limited to, Auriga) are disrupting satellites far too readily, or that the Milky Way's satellites are more disrupted than current imaging surveys have revealed. Future observing facilities and careful mock observations of these systems will be key to revealing the nature of this apparent discrepancy., Galaxies like the Milky Way are surrounded by a complex population of accreted satellite galaxies at all stages of tidal disruption - including intact dwarf galaxies, stellar streams, and phase-mixed debris. Many of these substructures in the Milky Way's halo have been revealed in recent years thanks to large surveys like SDSS, DES, and Gaia. At the same time, cosmological simulations have reached resolutions at which we can study populations of tidal remnants around Milky Way-mass hosts. These simulations reveal that even the seemingly intact satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way may be much more complex and more disrupted than previously believed. In this talk, I will present simulated populations of satellite galaxies across the spectrum of tidal disruption, and discuss implications for the populations of surviving and disrupted dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, as well as predictions for studies of tidally disrupting satellites in future surveys like the Rubin Observatory LSST., We present the first detailed comparison of populations of dwarf galaxy stellar streams in cosmological simulations and the Milky Way. In particular, we compare streams identified around 13 Milky Way analogs in the FIRE-2 simulations to streams observed by the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S <SUP>5</SUP>). For an accurate comparison, we produce mock Dark Energy Survey (DES) observations of the FIRE streams and estimate the detectability of their tidal tails and progenitors. The number and stellar mass distributions of detectable stellar streams is consistent between observations and simulations. However, there are discrepancies in the distributions of pericenters and apocenters, with the detectable FIRE streams, on average, forming at larger pericenters (out to &gt;110 kpc) and surviving only at larger apocenters (≳40 kpc) than those observed in the Milky Way. We find that the population of high-stellar-mass dwarf galaxy streams in the Milky Way is incomplete. Interestingly, a large fraction of the FIRE streams would only be detected as intact satellites in DES-like observations, since their tidal tails have too low surface brightness to be detectable. We thus predict a population of yet-undetected tidal tails around Milky Way satellites, as well as a population of fully undetected low-surface-brightness stellar streams, and estimate their detectability with the Rubin Observatory. Finally, we discuss the causes and implications of the discrepancies between the stream populations in FIRE and the Milky Way, and explore future avenues for tests of satellite disruption in cosmological simulations., Recent large photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic surveys have enabled the first systematic observations of Milky Way stellar streams in 6D. At the same time, cutting edge cosmological simulations are now at resolutions that allow for the study of dwarf galaxy streams around Milky Way-like hosts. In this talk, I will present the discovery and characterization of a population of 6D stellar streams with observations from the Dark Energy Survey, Gaia, and the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5) in comparison to streams identified in cosmological simulations. These comparisons enable deeper studies of satellite populations and tidal disruption in simulations and observations, and further tests of the small-scale challenges to LCDM., Recent large photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic surveys have enabled the first systematic observations of Milky Way stellar streams in 6D. At the same time, cutting edge cosmological simulations are finally approaching resolutions that allow for the study of dwarf galaxy streams around Milky Way-like hosts. In this talk, I will present the discovery and characterization of a population of 6D stellar streams with observations from the Dark Energy Survey, Gaia, and the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5), and compare this population to streams identified in cosmological simulations. These comparisons enable deeper studies of satellite populations and tidal disruption in simulations and observations, and further tests of the small-scale challenges to LCDM., Stellar streams are excellent probes of the underlying gravitational potential in which they evolve. In this work, we fit dynamical models to five streams in the Southern Galactic hemisphere, combining observations from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S <SUP>5</SUP>), Gaia EDR3, and the Dark Energy Survey, to measure the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With an ensemble of streams, we find a mass of the LMC ranging from ~14-19 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, probed over a range of closest approach times and distances. With the most constraining stream (Orphan-Chenab), we measure an LMC mass of ${18.8}_{-4.0}^{+3.5}\times {10}^{10}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , probed at a closest approach time of 310 Myr and a closest approach distance of 25.4 kpc. This mass is compatible with previous measurements, showing that a consistent picture is emerging of the LMC's influence on structures in the Milky Way. Using this sample of streams, we find that the LMC's effect depends on the relative orientation of the stream and LMC at their point of closest approach. To better understand this, we present a simple model based on the impulse approximation and we show that the LMC's effect depends both on the magnitude of the velocity kick imparted to the stream and the direction of this kick., We cross-match high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with accurate multiband photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) DR1 to confidently measure proper motions for nine stellar streams in the DES footprint: Aliqa Uma, ATLAS, Chenab, Elqui, Indus, Jhelum, Phoenix, Tucana III, and Turranburra. We determine low-confidence proper-motion measurements for four additional stellar streams: Ravi, Wambelong, Willka Yaku, and Turbio. We find evidence for a misalignment between stream tracks and the systemic proper motion of streams that may suggest a systematic gravitational influence from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These proper motions, when combined with radial velocity measurements, will allow for detailed orbit modeling that can be used to constrain properties of the LMC and its effect on nearby streams, as well as global properties of the Milky Way's gravitational potential. <P />(1 data file)., Stellar streams, the tidal remnants of accreted globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, are uniquely powerful tools for studying the Milky Way. In particular, they allow for strong constraints on the local distribution of dark matter, and they provide insight into how our Galaxy has evolved over time. However, addressing these essential questions requires a large, well-observed sample of stellar streams with full 6D phase-space measurements. I will present the first population of systematically-observed 6D stellar streams, including their discovery in the Dark Energy Survey, and the measurement of their proper motions and radial velocities with Gaia DR2 and the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5). In addition, I will present constraints on the mass of the Milky Way's largest satellite, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and discuss future plans for using these 6D streams to learn about dark matter and galaxy formation in the Local Universe., We use photometry from the DECam Legacy Survey to detect candidate tidal tails extending ∼5° on either side of the Palomar 13 globular cluster. The tails are aligned with the proper motion of Palomar 13 and are consistent with its old, metal-poor stellar population. We identify three RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) that are plausibly associated with the tails, in addition to four previously known in the cluster. From these RRLs, we find that the mean distance to the cluster and tails is 23.6 ± 0.2 kpc and estimate the total (initial) luminosity of the cluster to be ${L}_{V}={5.1}_{-3.4}^{+9.7}\times {10}^{3}\,{L}_{\odot }$ , consistent with previous claims that its initial luminosity was higher than its current luminosity. Combined with previously determined proper motion and radial velocity measurements of the cluster, we find that Palomar 13 is on a highly eccentric orbit (e ∼ 0.8) with a pericenter of ∼9 kpc and an apocenter of ∼69 kpc, and a recent pericentric passage of the cluster ∼75 Myr ago. We note a prominent linear structure in the interstellar dust map that runs parallel to the candidate tidal features, but conclude that reddening due to dust is unlikely to account for the structure that we observe. If confirmed, the Palomar 13 stellar stream would be one of very few streams with a known progenitor system, making it uniquely powerful for studying the disruption of globular clusters, the formation of the stellar halo, and the distribution of matter within our Galaxy., We cross-match high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with accurate multiband photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) DR1 to confidently measure proper motions for nine stellar streams in the DES footprint: Aliqa Uma, ATLAS, Chenab, Elqui, Indus, Jhelum, Phoenix, Tucana III, and Turranburra. We determine low-confidence proper-motion measurements for four additional stellar streams: Ravi, Wambelong, Willka Yaku, and Turbio. We find evidence for a misalignment between stream tracks and the systemic proper motion of streams that may suggest a systematic gravitational influence from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These proper motions, when combined with radial velocity measurements, will allow for detailed orbit modeling that can be used to constrain properties of the LMC and its effect on nearby streams, as well as global properties of the Milky Way’s gravitational potential., , In this poster I will present a kinematic analysis of the stellar streams recently discovered with the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The DES data, covering ∼5000 sq. deg. to a depth of g &gt; 23.5 with a relative photometric calibration uncertainty of &lt; 1%, has allowed for unprecedented observations of the stellar density features in the southern sky, including the discovery of eleven new stellar streams, and improved observations of four previously known streams. I will present the proper motion measurements of these DES streams from Gaia DR2, as well the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5), an ongoing survey to obtain radial velocity measurements of all known streams in the southern hemisphere. Together, this 6D phase space information for the DES streams will allow for stronger constraints on the formation of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, and the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way., We perform a search for stellar streams around the Milky Way using the first 3 yr of multiband optical imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We use DES data covering ∼5000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> to a depth of g &gt; 23.5 with a relative photometric calibration uncertainty of &lt;1%. This data set yields unprecedented sensitivity to the stellar density field in the southern celestial hemisphere, enabling the detection of faint stellar streams to a heliocentric distance of ∼50 kpc. We search for stellar streams using a matched filter in color-magnitude space derived from a synthetic isochrone of an old, metal-poor stellar population. Our detection technique recovers four previously known thin stellar streams: Phoenix, ATLAS, Tucana III, and a possible extension of Molonglo. In addition, we report the discovery of 11 new stellar streams. In general, the new streams detected by DES are fainter, more distant, and lower surface brightness than streams detected by similar techniques in previous photometric surveys. As a by-product of our stellar stream search, we find evidence for extratidal stellar structure associated with four globular clusters: NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. The ever-growing sample of stellar streams will provide insight into the formation of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, and the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way., We perform a search for stellar streams around the Milky Way using the first three years of multi-band optical imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We use DES data covering 5000 sq. deg. to a depth of g &gt; 23 . 5 with a relative photometric calibration uncertainty of &lt; 1 % . This data set yields unprecedented sensitivity to the stellar density field in the southern celestial hemisphere, enabling the detection of faint stellar streams to a heliocentric distance of 50 kpc. We search for stellar streams using a matched-filter in color-magnitude space derived from a synthetic isochrone of an old, metal-poor stellar population. We report the discovery of eleven new stellar streams. In general, these streams are fainter, more distant, and lower surface brightness than streams detected by similar techniques in previous photometric surveys. As a by-product of our stellar stream search, we find evidence for extra-tidal stellar structure associated with four globular clusters: NGC 288, NGC 1261, NGC 1851, and NGC 1904. The ever-growing sample of stellar streams will provide insight into the formation of the Galactic stellar halo, the Milky Way gravitational potential, as well as the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way., We present a search for Galactic stellar streams in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), using three years of optical data taken across 5000 sq. degrees of the southern sky. The wide-field, uniform DES photometry provides unprecedented sensitivity to the stellar density field in the southern hemisphere, allowing for the detection of faint stellar populations. We follow the “Field of Streams” procedure developed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Belokurov et al., 2006) to identify stellar density features such as dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and the stellar streams resulting from the tidal disruption of these objects. Improved analysis techniques applied to the DES data enable the discovery of new stellar streams, and provide added insight into the origin and stellar populations of previously identified objects. An increased sample size together with detailed characterization of individual stellar streams and their progenitors can inform our understanding of the formation of the Milky Way stellar halo, as well as the large and small scale distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way., Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is a massive stellar cluster located within the Galaxy at a distance of ~5 kpc from the Earth. The cluster is thought to be a site of significant Galactic cosmic ray acceleration. Further insight into this possibility can be gained through the study of gamma-ray emission from the cluster. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) has detected an extended TeV source coincident with Wd 1 and now the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected extended GeV gamma-ray emission from the region. Examining this data allows for a more precise understanding of the emission originating from Wd 1 itself. We modeled the source as a 2-dimensional gaussian and, considering the region within 15º of the nominal position of Wd 1, determined the maximum likelihood spectrum, position, and extension. It is clear that a significant, extended GeV source is present and may be associated with the stellar cluster. We will additionally explore any energy dependence in the source's morphology to understand implications, particularly for the source association. Continued examination of the emission originating from the Wd 1 region will reveal details about the acceleration and composition of particles, both leptons and hadrons, originating in the region.","['2024arXiv241009143S', '10.48550/arXiv.2410.09143', 'arXiv:2410.09143', '2024AAS...24341904S', '10.3847/1538-4357/acc582', '2022arXiv220802255S', 'arXiv:2208.02255', '2023ApJ...949...44S', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.02255', '2023AAS...24122005S', '2022DDA....5320304S', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac2e93', 'arXiv:2107.13004', '2021arXiv210713004S', '2021ApJ...923..149S', '10.48550/arXiv.2107.13004', '2021yCat..18850003S', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18850003', '2021AAS...23722704S', '2020AJ....160..244S', '2020arXiv200612501S', '10.3847/1538-3881/abbd3a', 'arXiv:2006.12501', '10.48550/arXiv.2006.12501', '2019ApJ...885....3S', '2019arXiv190709488S', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab44bf', 'arXiv:1907.09488', '10.48550/arXiv.1907.09488', '2019ibsd.confE..20S', '2019AAS...23325606S', '2018ApJ...862..114S', 'arXiv:1801.03097', '10.48550/arXiv.1801.03097', '10.3847/1538-4357/aacdab', '2018arXiv180103097S', '2018APS..APRR15008S', '2018AAS...23121205S', '2015AAS...22524724S']","[('stream', 79), ('stellar', 65), ('milky', 35), ('survey', 27), ('population', 23), ('galaxy', 21), ('satellite', 20), ('de', 19), ('dark', 17), ('tidal', 15)]","[(('stellar', 'stream'), 44), (('proper', 'motion'), 12), (('dark', 'energy'), 11), (('energy', 'survey'), 11), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 9), (('cosmological', 'simulation'), 8), (('spectroscopic', 'survey'), 8), (('tidal', 'disruption'), 7), (('survey', 'de'), 7), (('southern', 'stellar'), 6)]","[(('dark', 'energy', 'survey'), 11), (('energy', 'survey', 'des'), 7), (('southern', 'stellar', 'stream'), 6), (('stellar', 'stream', 'spectroscopic'), 6), (('stream', 'spectroscopic', 'survey'), 6), (('milky', 'gravitational', 'potential'), 5), (('distribution', 'dark', 'matter'), 5), (('dwarf', 'galaxy', 'streams'), 4), (('large', 'magellanic', 'cloud'), 4), (('radial', 'velocity', 'measurements'), 4)]",Dirty

Astronomers typically use carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the bulk distribution and mass of H<SUB>2</SUB> in our galaxy and many others. CO observations alone fail to trace a significant component of molecular gas known as ""CO-dark"" molecular gas, which can be probed with molecules such as OH and CH. We present an extremely sensitive pilot search for the 18 cm hydroxyl (OH) lines in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We successfully detected the 1665 and 1667 MHz OH lines in faint emission. The 1665/1667 MHz line ratio displays the characteristic 5:9 ratio predicted under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of nonmaser 18 cm OH emission in another galaxy. We compare our OH and H I observations with archival CO (1–0) observations. Our OH detection position overlaps with the previously discovered Arp Outer Arm in CO. Our best estimates show that the amount of H<SUB>2</SUB> traced by OH is 100%–140% higher than the amount traced by CO in this sight line. The amount of dark molecular gas implied by dust data supports this conclusion. We conclude that the 18 cm OH lines hold promise as a valuable tool for mapping of the ""CO-dark"" and ""CO-faint"" molecular gas phase in nearby galaxies, especially with upcoming multibeam, phased-array feed receivers on radio telescopes, which will allow for drastically improved mapping speeds of faint signals., We present the serendipitous discovery of an extremely broad (ΔV<SUB>LSR</SUB> ~ 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), faint (T<SUB>mb</SUB> &lt; 10 mK), and ubiquitous 1667 and 1665 MHz ground-state thermal OH emission toward the second quadrant of the outer Galaxy (R<SUB>gal</SUB> &gt; 8 kpc) with the Green Bank Telescope. Originally discovered in 2015, we describe the redundant experimental, observational, and data quality tests of this result over the last five years. The longitude-velocity distribution of the emission unambiguously suggests large-scale Galactic structure. We observe a smooth distribution of OH in radial velocity that is morphologically similar to the H I radial velocity distribution in the outer Galaxy, showing that molecular gas is significantly more extended in the outer Galaxy than previously expected. Our results imply the existence of a thick (-200 pc &lt; z &lt; 200 pc) disk of diffuse ( ${n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ ~ 5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) molecular gas in the outer Galaxy previously undetected in all-sky <SUP>12</SUP>CO surveys., We carried out highly sensitive observations of main-line OH emission at 18cm with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in project AGBT14B_031 at 81 pointings (9x9 pixels grid) in the direction of GLON=105.00°,GLAT=+2.50° toward the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. The observations discussed in this paper were made between 2015 September 11 and 2016 January 31 in the frequency range 1.15-1.73GHz (L-Band). <P />For comparison with the OH data, we used the <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1-0) data from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO; Heyer+ 1998ApJS..115..241H) CO survey. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1-0) observations were made between 1995 and 1998 using the 14m telescope of the FCRAO. <P />(1 data file)., We report the results from a new, highly sensitive (ΔTmb ∼ 3mK) survey for thermal OH emission at 1665 and 1667 MHz over a dense, 9 x 9-pixel grid covering a 1 square degree patch of sky in the direction of L = 105.00, B = +2.50 towards the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We compare our Green Bank Telescope (GBT) 1667 MHz OH results with archival CO(1-0) observations from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) Outer Galaxy Survey within the velocity range of the Perseus arm at this galactic longitude. Of the 81 statistically-independent pointings in our survey area, 86% show detectable OH emission at 1667 MHz, and 19% of them show detectable CO emission. We explore the possible physical conditions of the observed features using a set of diffuse molecular cloud models. In the context of these models, both OH and CO disappear at current sensitivity limits, CO emission does not appear until the volume density exceeds 100-200 cm-3 . These results demonstrate that a combination of low column density and low volume density can explain the lack of CO emission at sightlines exhibiting OH emission. The 18-cm OH main lines, with their low critical density of n ∗ ∼ 1 cm-3 , are collisionally excited over a large fraction of the quiescent galactic environment and, for observations of sufficient sensitivity, provide an optically-thin radio tracer for diffuse molecular hydrogen., The near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are a population of objects on orbits that cross or come near that of Earth; primarily rocky ``rubble-pile'' aggregates made up of fragments of rock held together by self-gravity and cohesion. NEAs' shapes are linked to their compositions, internal structures, and dynamical histories, giving us insight into the processes that form them. Detailed shape models are valuable for modelling of shape-sensitive non-gravitational forces which play a significant part in their dynamical evolution and moving them into Earth-crossing orbits. Knowing NEAs' shapes can also help facilitate future asteroid exploration and planetary defence mission planning. <P />Delay-Doppler radar observations are a unique source of Earth-based information about the physical properties of NEAs [1]. However, producing asteroid shapes from radar data is a computationally intensive task. Unlike in optical images, multiple points on an asteroid's surface (having the same distance to the observer and relative velocity) map to the same position in a delay-Doppler radar image. The SHAPE software, currently used by the radar community [2] requires extensive human oversight through gradual improvements in the fitted 3D shape model. Therefore, the process of constructing a 3D shape and spin-state model for a single asteroid can take several months. <P />Our study team has identified major bottlenecks in the shape determination of NEAs and developed machine learning methods to overcome them [3]. With a sufficiently extensive training set, radar images of real and synthetic asteroids with known shapes, and properly adjusted parameters for learning, a neural network can be trained to recognize features in radar images and link them to surface features on the asteroid. A trained network will produce an approximate 3D shape almost instantaneously. <P />When completed; these tools will allow much more extensive exploration of the physical properties of radar-detected asteroids, rapidly analyzing existing and new radar datasets. We will present the current state of the project and discuss the work required to complete it. <P />This work was initially supported by the NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) programme. <P />[1] L.A.M.

DPS proc., 326.11, 2016., The authors regret that Table 1 of this paper gives the resolution of the 2008 December 21 delay-Doppler radar images of 2008 EV5 from the Goldstone Solar System Radar incorrectly. The true resolution of those images is 0.125 μs × 1.003 Hz., We report the results from a new, highly sensitive (ΔT <SUB>mb</SUB> ∼ 3 mK) survey for thermal OH emission at 1665 and 1667 MHz over a dense, 9 × 9 pixel grid covering a 1° × 1° patch of sky in the direction of l = 105.°00, b = +2.°50 toward the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We compare our Green Bank Telescope 1667 MHz OH results with archival <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1-0) observations from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Outer Galaxy Survey within the velocity range of the Perseus Arm at these galactic coordinates. Out of the 81 statistically independent pointings in our survey area, 86% show detectable OH emission at 1667 MHz, and 19% of them show detectable CO emission. We explore the possible physical conditions of the observed features using a set of diffuse molecular cloud models. In the context of these models, both OH and CO disappear at current sensitivity limits below an A <SUB>v</SUB> of 0.2, but the CO emission does not appear until the volume density exceeds 100-200 {cm}}<SUP>-3</SUP>. These results demonstrate that a combination of low column density A <SUB>v</SUB> and low volume density n <SUB>H</SUB> can explain the lack of CO emission along sight lines exhibiting OH emission. The 18 cm OH main lines, with their low critical density of n* ∼ 1 {cm}}<SUP>-3</SUP>, are collisionally excited over a large fraction of the quiescent galactic environment and, for observations of sufficient sensitivity, provide an optically thin radio tracer for diffuse H<SUB>2</SUB>., Characterizing the shapes and spin states of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is essential both for ruling out potential future Earth impacts and for planning spacecraft missions. Delay-Doppler radar imaging is a powerful technique to characterize NEAs. Radar observations using the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar have provided detailed images of many near-Earth asteroids. Reconstructing objects' shapes and spins from delay-Doppler data is a computationally intensive inversion problem. Since the 1990s, delay-Doppler data has been analyzed using the SHAPE software (Hudson 1993, Magri et al. 2007), providing shape models of a few dozen NEAs out of the hundreds observed with radar.SHAPE performs sequential single-parameter fitting and requires considerable computer runtime and human supervision. Multiple-parameter fitting algorithms can more efficiently invert delay-Doppler datasets (Greenberg &amp; Margot 2015) and decrease runtime, but extensive human oversight of the shape modeling process is still required. Producing a single NEA shape model typically takes weeks to months. We have explored the application of two techniques to accelerate and better automate delay-Doppler shape modeling: Bayesian optimization and deep neural networks.One of the most time-intensive steps of the radar shape modeling process is to perform a grid search to constrain the target's spin state. We have implemented a Bayesian optimization routine that uses SHAPE to autonomously search the full space of spin-state parameters. Bayesian optimization yields spin-state constraints with more than a factor of 3 less computer runtime than a grid search and with minimal human supervision. These routines are now being incorporated into radar data processing pipelines at Arecibo.The shape modeling process could be further accelerated using a deep neural network to replace iterative fitting, quickly providing a good approximation of an asteroid's shape and spin state. However, neural network approaches require training with thousands of known asteroid shapes and corresponding sets of delay-Doppler images - far more than the current radar sample. To overcome this limitation, we have produced a database of simulated radar observations. The current database includes 10,000 artificial shape models mimicking the distribution of known asteroid shapes and simulated delay-Doppler data sets produced using a wide range of spin states and orbits for each of the artificial shapes. The database can be further expanded as needed.We are now experimenting with training different neural network architectures, with the goal of eventually having a software routine that can produce an approximate shape and spin state model from a delay-Doppler radar dataset almost instantaneously.This work was supported by the NASA Frontier Development Lab program., One of the most compelling questions in astrophysics today is how the process of galaxy formation unfolded during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A new generation of radio telescopes, including the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and others, are attempting to capture the redshifted 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen during the EoR. Mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is one of the core objectives of 21 cm observatories. A pressing concern of these observations is the bright foreground sources in the telescope's sidelobes outside the primary beam of the MWA. These sources, including AGN, radio galaxies and local Galactic sources, are numerous and difficult to deal with. These foreground contaminants are five orders of magnitude brighter than the redshifted 21 cm emission expected from the IGM during the EoR. The Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in New Mexico can provide sensitive characterization of these sources in the MWA's northern sidelobe. We observed 100 bright radio sources using the JVLA in P-band and characterized these sources by extracting the spectral fits and fluxes for each source. By creating a foreground model for these data, the MWA will be able to better subtract these sources from future EoR measurements. We report the current status of the creation of the foreground model., Near-Earth asteroid 2015 HM10 was discovered on 2015 April 19 with the 4-m Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo (MPEC 2015-H90). HM10 made a 0.00295 AU / 1.14 lunar distance flyby of Earth on July 7. This was the asteroid’s closest approach to Earth until at least 2419.We observed HM10 with radar between July 5 and July 8 using Arecibo, the 70 m DSS-14 and 34 m DSS-13 antennas at Goldstone, Green Bank, and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Bistatic observations were crucial to obtain high-resolution images of HM10 due to the short round-trip travel time of the radar signal, which was as low as 2.95 s on July 7. Our finest image resolution was 3.75 m/pixel in range, obtained on July 7 with the new 80 kW C-band (7190 MHz, 4.2 cm) transmitter on DSS-13 and receiving at Green Bank with the new radar backend.Optical lightcurves obtained prior to closest approach indicated that HM10 has a spin period of ~22.2 minutes and an elongated shape (W. Ryan, pers. comm). The delay-Doppler radar images confirm the rotation period estimated from photometry and reveal that HM10 has a long-axis extent of 80-100 m with an equatorial aspect ratio of about 2:1. Radar speckle tracking transmitting from Arecibo and receiving with the VLBA on July 6 rule out any non-principal axis ‘wobble’ with an amplitude greater than ~10º.HM10’s rapid rotation implies significant cohesion, with a minimum tensile strength of 25-150 Pa required at its center to prevent disruption, assuming overall bulk density between 0.7 and 3.9 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. This is comparable to strength predictions for rubble-pile aggregates (e.g. Scheeres, Britt, Carry, &amp; Holsapple 2015, Asteroids IV, in press). HM10 is not necessarily a ‘monolith’.HM10’s shape is complex and irregular. The radar images show angular features and ‘facets’ up to ~30 m across. There is also a cluster of radar-bright pixels that tracks with HM10’s rotation, consistent with a high standing feature 15-20 m across. This feature is similar in appearance to radar images of decameter-scale boulders on other asteroids., Imaging of potential targets in advance of any spacecraft mission is important for reducing mission cost and risk and improving science returns. New high-resolution radar imaging capabilities make characterizing targets to 2-4 m scale possible., Recent upgrades to the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Solar System Radar allow the transmitted waveform to be modulated at up to 40 MHz, providing resolution as fine as 3.75 m in line-of-sight distance for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and the Moon. Bistatic observations, transmitting with an antenna at Goldstone and receiving with either another Goldstone antenna or a larger antenna such as the Arecibo Observatory or the Green Bank Telescope, give the highest possible sensitivity combined with high resolution. High-resolution bistatic radar projects have revealed spin state changes and the presence of boulders on many NEAs. Examples include radar imaging campaigns on the NEAs 2005 YU55, Toutatis, 2012 DA14, and 2014 HQ124. In the near future, a new high-resolution transmitter on Goldstone's DSS-13 antenna will be able to transmit a signal modulated at 80 MHz, improving line-of-sight resolution by a factor of two to 1.875 m. This will allow many new projects: seeing previously-invisible surface details; measuring the size distributions of boulders and possibly craters on small NEAs; obtaining better estimates of the masses and densities of asteroids from radiation pressure perturbations to their trajectories; improved trajectory predictions for small spacecraft targets and potential Earth impactors; and possibly imaging the reconfiguration of asteroids' surfaces due to tides during extremely close Earth flybys. Somewhat further into the future, a 1.875-m-resolution transmitter may be installed on a 34-m antenna at the DSN's Canberra complex. This would allow radar imaging of objects in the far southern sky, which current radars cannot see. It would also facilitate rapid follow-up of newly discovered radar targets and before-and-after observations of NEAs making flybys close enough to cause tidal reconfiguration, which move very quickly across the sky at closest approach. As with the current 3.75-m-resolution system, these future high-resolution transmitters will provide the best scientific results when operated in bistatic mode with a large antenna as the receive station. Equipment to be installed at Arecibo and at Green Bank is able to record 80-MHz-coded radar echoes., Radar speckle tracking is an observational technique to constrain the spin state of a target object. When illuminated by a monochromatic radar beam, the target scatters light into regions of constructive and destructive interference - a speckle pattern. This pattern moves as the target rotates, with a speed and direction determined by the object’s rotation rate and spin vector. By tracking the motion of a radar speckle pattern between two or more receiving stations, we can constrain the spin state of the target.First applied to measure the spin state of Mercury, since 2008 radar speckle tracking has become one of the standard techniques for radar observations of near-Earth asteroids. We transmit with either of the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars, receive with elements of the Very Long Baseline Array or of the Very Large Array, and measure the time lags between the speckle pattern as seen by each station. Starting with the first asteroid observed with speckle observations, 2008 EV5, this technique has allowed us to resolve ambiguities in asteroids’ spin states that delay-Doppler radar imaging and lightcurve observations did not.Recent radar speckle targets have included the near-Earth asteroids 1998 ML14, 2005 WK4, and 2014 HQ124. ML14 was observed with radar shortly after its discovery in 1998, but the earlier radar observations did not yield a unique pole direction constraint. HQ124 is a contact-binary object and was one of the best radar targets of 2014., (4179) Toutatis is one of the best-characterized objects in the near-Earth population. It is near to a 4:1 orbital resonance with the Earth, and makes close approaches at four-year intervals for 20--28 years before going out of phase for several decades. Toutatis has been imaged by radar at Arecibo and/or Goldstone during each flyby since 1992. <P />Previous radar observations have shown that Toutatis is irregular, bifurcated, ≈4.5 km long, with an unusual non-principal-axis spin state (Ostro et al. 1995; Hudson &amp; Ostro 1995; Hudson, Ostro &amp; Scheeres 2003). Arecibo radar images from the 2008 close approach showed that Toutatis is dramatically affected by gravitational tidal torques. During each orbit, Toutatis' spin state changes by up to 0.1% of the asteroid's total rotational angular momentum (Takahashi, Busch &amp; Scheeres 2013). <P />In December of 2012, Toutatis approached within 0.0463 au (6.93 million km) of the Earth. This was the last approach within 0.1 au until 2069. We conducted an extensive campaign of radar observations with Goldstone and with elements of the Very Large Array. Radar images were obtained on 16 days between December 4 and December 22. They bracket both the closest approach by the asteroid to the Earth and the Chang'e 2 spacecraft flyby of the asteroid on December 13 (Huang et al. 2013; Xiaoduan et al. 2013). <P />The radar images on December 12 and 13 had range resolution of 3.75 m/pixel and show a wealth of surface features, many previously unseen, including radar-bright spots that we interpret as decameter-scale boulders. Some can be linked to features visible in the Chang'e 2 images. The spacecraft and 2012 Goldstone images reveal that previous radar-derived shape models accurately reproduced Toutatis' dimensions and global shape, but both the big end and the joint are actually more angular than previously realized. <P />Toutatis' non-principal-axis spin state allows us to determine its moment-of-inertia ratios, which constrain the asteroid's internal structure. We have constructed an improved model of Toutatis' changing spin state, covering 1992 to 2012 and including gravitational torques from the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Jupiter. Other torques, such as excursions due to YORP, are not significant compared to the uncertainties in Toutatis' orientation. <P />We are updating the Toutatis shape model based on the 2012 radar images. The new radar-derived model more accurately represents the angularities in Toutatis' shape. The 2012 images provided far better views of all of Toutatis' surface and especially the big end than were obtained during previous flybys, and updates to the SHAPE software (Magri et al. 2007) allow us to avoid biases that made the earlier Toutatis shape models artificially rounded., Over 40 near-Earth asteroids are now known to have satellites. Delay-Doppler radar imaging has identified the majority of these systems, including both known triple NEAs. Roughly one-sixth of NEAs larger than ~200 m in diameter have satellites; this fraction rises to two-thirds for rapidly rotating large NEAs with spin periods between 2 and 3.5 hours. This distribution is consistent with many NEAs being rubble-pile objects that are disrupted by YORP radiation-pressure spin-up. The observed volume and inferred mass ratios for NEA satellites vary widely, from about 1:1 for the nearly-equal-mass binary 69230 Hermes to 1:1000 or more for objects like 1862 Apollo. The smallest known satellite of any near-Earth asteroid is that of 2004 DC, which has a satellite that is ~60 m in diameter. We have studied archival radar observations to place limits on the occurrence of still smaller satellites. Nearly 60 NEAs with diameters &gt;200 m and spin periods &lt;3.5 hours have been imaged by the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars. Again, roughly two-thirds of these objects have satellites 60 m or more in diameter. For 14 objects, we would have been able to detect satellites as small as or smaller than 50 m had they been present, assuming a satellite spin period of &gt;2 hours and setting an SNR threshold of &gt;5/delay-Doppler pixel. For 10 objects, our detection limit was &lt;15 m. For 3 objects, it was &lt;5 m. We do not exclude small satellites entirely, but the fraction of large fast-spinning NEAs with satellites 15 - 50 m in diameter is conservatively &lt;15%, many times less than the fraction with larger satellites. While rotational fission is the probable source of the NEA satellites, the details of satellite formation are not well understood. There are two proposed processes for producing satellites on stable orbits around their primaries. First, the primary may experience several small fission events, and the material in orbit accumulate into a single large satellite. Second, the primary may shed a large mass of material, producing an unstable satellite that rapidly splits, leaving a large satellite in orbit while some material escapes the system entirely or is re-accreted. The apparent lower size limit of roughly 50 m for NEA satellites has implications for both of these satellite formation models and for asteroid internal structures. Either even the smallest fission events shed enough material to create ~50 m satellites immediately, or small fission events must happen in rapid sequence so that few-decameter satellites are so rare that none have yet been observed. The lower size limit may also represent a cohesive limit for satellites that form on unstable orbits. If a satellite has too much cohesion, it cannot undergo a secondary fission that would leave a portion of its mass on a stable orbit., Near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis is close to a 4:1 orbital resonance with Earth. It has been observed extensively with radar during close Earth flybys in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. Previous radar observations have shown that Toutatis is bifurcated, ~4.5 km long, with an unusual non-principal-axis spin state. In December of 2012, Toutatis approached within 0.0463 AU (6.93 million km) of Earth, the last flyby within 0.2 AU until 2069. We conducted an extensive campaign of radar imaging and radar speckle tracking with Goldstone and with elements of the Very Large Array. The radar images were obtained on 16 days between December 4 and December 22 and include time on December 13 when the Chang’e 2 spacecraft flew by the asteroid. The radar images on December 12 and 13 had range resolution of 3.75 m/pixel and show a wealth of surface features, many previously unseen, including radar-bright spots that we interpret as decameter-scale boulders similar to those visible in the Chang’e 2 images. Both the 2012 radar images and the spacecraft images confirm the radar-based Toutatis shape model published by Hudson et al. 2003 (Icarus 161, 346-355) but also show where that model can be improved - particularly the big end of Toutatis, which was not imaged extensively by radar prior to 2012. During each orbit, Toutatis’ spin state changes by up to 0.1% of the asteroid’s total angular momentum due to gravitational tides from the Sun and Earth. We have constructed a model of Toutatis’ spin state in which we numerically integrate the tidal torques on the asteroid to match the orientation of Toutatis at each apparition. The tidal spin state changes and the non-principal-axis rotation allow us to estimate Toutatis’ moments of inertia independently of its shape. We will present the 2012 radar images and describe our current knowledge of the asteroid’s shape and spin state. The unprecedented resolution and orientation coverage of the 2012 radar data and Chang’e 2 images will allow us to improve our model of Toutatis’ shape, surface properties, spin state, and internal structure., The 4.6-km-long near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis has made close Earth flybys every four years between 1988 and 2012, and has been observed with high-resolution radar imaging during each approach since 1992 (Ostro et al. 1995, Hudson et al. 1995, Ostro et al. 1999, Hudson et al. 2003, Busch et al. 2012). Toutatis has an elongated bilobate shape and a complex non-principal axis spin state, which can be described as rotation around its long axis with a period of 5.41 days and precession of the long axis around the overall angular momentum every 7.35 days. Due to its elongation and relatively slow rotation, Toutatis' spin has changed due to terrestrial tides during each close flyby and due to solar tides during each perihelion passage. The maximum spin change was ~0.08°/day during the 2004 Earth flyby when Toutatis passed within 0.01036 AU (≈4 lunar distances). We have constructed a model of Toutatis' spin state spanning 1992 to 2012 and have estimated its moments of inertia from its response to known tidal potentials. Toutatis' moments of inertia about its short and intermediate principal axes as compared to that about the long axis are 3 ± 1% and 4 ± 1% larger respectively than the values expected if the asteroid had uniform density. Material is segregated along the asteroid's long axis. The observed moment-of-inertia ratios are consistent with a roughly 15% density difference between the lobes and also with more complex internal structures. Near-Earth asteroids can be heterogeneous in composition and/or porosity on kilometer scales. We will test our model of Toutatis' shape, spin, and interior with additional observations before and after the asteroid makes a 0.04633 AU flyby in December 2012. This will be Toutatis' last close Earth encounter until 2069., , At least 10% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 m in diameter observed by radar are contact binaries, which we define as objects composed of two lobes in contact with each other that may once have been in mutual orbit. We will present new shape models and pole directions for three contact binaries imaged by radar: 11066 Sigurd, 2000 YF29, and 2004 XL14. The maximum dimensions for each object are 4.2 km for Sigurd, 0.4 km for 2000 YF29, and 0.3 km for 2004 XL14. Sigurd's lobes are elongated, roughly ellipsoidal, and are joined on their long axis; 2000 YF29's larger lobe is oblate; and 2004 XL14 has lobes that are distinctly angular. Sigurd and 2000 YF29 have obliquities between 50°-130° and 2004 XL14 has an ambiguous obliquity that is close to either 0° or 180°. Of the contact binaries imaged by Arecibo and/or Goldstone, data from eleven are suitable for estimating pole directions. Eight of the eleven objects (73 ± 16%) have high obliquities between 50° and 130°, compared to 40 ± 13% of non-contact-binary single NEAs (10 of 25 objects) and 33 ± 19% of binary NEA systems (3 of 9 objects). Although this is only a marginally-significant detection (95% confidence), estimation of spin vectors from radar observations hints that contact binaries have systematically higher obliquities than other objects in the near-Earth population., On 2011 November 8, 2005 YU55 made a 0.845 lunar distance flyby. We organized a radar campaign using Arecibo, Goldstone, the GBT, and the VLBA. YU55 is 360 ± 40 m in diameter, has a surface strewn with 10-m scale boulders, and spins retrograde., , , In 2004, Toutatis passed within 0.0104 AU of Earth. The method of Scheeres et al. 2000 [4] predicts that tidal torques during that flyby should have significantly changed Toutatis' spin state due to its elongated shape and slow rotation. We have analyzed all of the available radar data, developing an improved model of Toutatis' rotation. Between 2004 and 2008, the change in Toutatis' spin state from the flyby accumulated to over 180º. The other flybys were at much greater distances (&gt;0.024 AU), but the asteroid's spin changed measurably after each encounter. Our model also includes better estimates of Toutatis' shape and moments of inertia. This work is ongoing, but we will discuss the implications of our results for the asteroid's history and internal structure, particularly if the moments of inertia are consistent with a uniform internal density. Toutatis' last close-Earth-approach for several decades will be in December 2012, when it will be 0.046 AU away. We will make predictions for what radar observations at that time should see., , We observed the near-Earth ASTEROID 2008 EV5 with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars and the Very Long Baseline Array during December 2008. EV5 rotates retrograde and its overall shape is a 400 ± 50 m oblate spheroid. The most prominent surface feature is a ridge parallel to the asteroid's equator that is broken by a concavity about 150 m in diameter. Otherwise the asteroid's surface is notably smooth on decameter scales. EV5's radar and optical albedos are consistent with either rocky or stony-iron composition. The equatorial ridge is similar to structure seen on the rubble-pile near-Earth asteroid (66391) 1999 KW4 and is consistent with YORP spin-up reconfiguring the asteroid in the past. We interpret the concavity as an impact crater. Shaking during the impact and later regolith redistribution may have erased smaller features, explaining the general lack of decameter-scale surface structure., , , , The near-Earth asteroid 2008 EV5 was discovered by the Mt. Lemmon Survey on March 4 2008, and approached to within 8.4 lunar distances in December 2008, when it was a very strong radar target. We observed EV5 with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars and the Very Long Baseline Array, and previously described those observations and obtaining EV5's pole direction. We have now completed a detailed model of EV5's shape. <P />The Arecibo delay-Doppler data provided 7.5-m spatial resolution, showing that EV5's overal","['arXiv:2311.12954', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad3af6', '10.48550/arXiv.2311.12954', '2023arXiv231112954B', '2024ApJ...967..148B', '10.48550/arXiv.2104.06538', '2021ApJ...914...72B', 'arXiv:2104.06538', '10.3847/1538-4357/abf832', '2021arXiv210406538B', '2021yCat..18830158B', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18830158', '2020AAS...23523604B', '2019AGUFM.P43E3513B', '2019Icar..333..548B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2019.06.005', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.04829', '2019ApJ...883..158B', 'arXiv:1908.04829', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab3a4b', '2019arXiv190804829B', '2018cosp...42E.481B', '2016AAS...22714007B', '2015DPS....4740205B', '2015LPICo1829.6034B', '2014AGUFM.P31A3974B', '2014DPS....4640905B', '2014acm..conf...69B', '2013AGUFM.P23A1762B', '2013DPS....4510105B', '2012AGUFM.P31A1873B', '2012MPC..81625...5B', '2012DPS....4430205B', '2012LPICo1667.6179B', '10.17189/1519561', '2012pds..data....3B', '2011MPC..76742...5B', '2011DPS....43..297B', '2011epsc.conf..297B', '2011MPC..75110...4B', '2011Icar..212..649B', 'arXiv:1101.3794', '10.48550/arXiv.1101.3794', '2011arXiv1101.3794B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2011.01.013', '2011MPC..73680...6B', '2011MPC..73063...1B', '2010MPC..72458...6B', '2010BAAS...42.1081B', '2010DPS....42.5705B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2010.05.002', '2010Icar..209..535B', '2010MPC..71963...5B', '2010MPC..71535...5B', '2010MPC..70199...7B', '2010MPC..69734...1B', '2010MPC..69665..42B', '2010LPICo1538.5070B', '2009arXiv0911.3976B', '10.48550/arXiv.0911.3976', 'arXiv:0911.3976', '2010MPC..69212...6B', '2010MPC..68682...1B', '2010PhDT.......441B', '2010PhDT.......381B', '2009MPC..67400...1B', '2009MPC..67090..30B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2009.06.025', '2009Icar..203..681B', '2009DPS....41.4310B', '2009MPC..66454...6B', '2009MPC..66193...1B', '2009MPC..65924...8B', '2009MPEC....K...42B', '2009MPC..65633...6B', '2009MPC..65329...5B', '2009MPEC....F...36B', '2009MPEC....E...37B', '2009Icar..200..347B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2008.12.003', '2009MPEC....C...28B', '2009MPC..65042...8B', '2009MPC..64755...6B', '2008MPEC....Y...62B', '2008MPC..64486...7B', '2008MPC..64098..10B', '2008DPS....40.2807B', '2008BAAS...40R.437B', '2008Icar..197..375B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2008.06.004', '2008NIMPA.592..393B', '10.1016/j.nima.2008.04.044', '2008Icar..195..614B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2008.01.020', '2008MPC..61983...6B', '2008MPC..61691...8B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2007.03.032', '2007Icar..190..608B', '2007MPC..60911...9B', '2007DPS....39.1704B', '2007BAAS...39..441B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2007.03.020', '2007Icar..189..589B', '2007MPC..59310...5B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2006.11.003', '2007Icar..186..581B', '2006BAAS...38R.582B', '2006DPS....38.5309B', '2006SASS...25..169B', '2006Icar..181..145B', '10.1016/j.icarus.2005.10.024', '2005BAAS...37S.639B', '2005DPS....37.1504B', '2005MPC..54352...4B', '2005MPC..54305..26B', '2005MPEC....J...57B', '2005MPEC....J...36B', '2005MPC..54102..27B', '2005MPEC....J...30B', '2005MPEC....J...35B', '2004AGUFMSM21A0450B', '2004MPC..52894...6B', '2004MPC..52502...2B', '2004MPC..51551...2B', '2004MPC..50634...1B', '2004JBIS...57..301B', '2003MPEC....Y...93B', '2003MPC..49937...3B']","[('radar', 120), ('asteroid', 103), ('shape', 65), ('earth', 62), ('spin', 52), ('model', 45), ('toutatis', 42), ('observation', 41), ('state', 39), ('image', 37)]","[(('spin', 'state'), 34), (('earth', 'asteroid'), 29), (('delay', 'doppler'), 27), (('radar', 'image'), 17), (('pole', 'direction'), 17), (('shape', 'model'), 14), (('radar', 'observation'), 13), (('radar', 'imaging'), 13), (('shape', 'spin'), 11), (('arecibo', 'goldstone'), 11)]","[(('delay', 'doppler', 'radar'), 10), (('shape', 'spin', 'state'), 7), (('green', 'bank', 'telescope'), 6), (('delay', 'doppler', 'data'), 6), (('long', 'baseline', 'array'), 6), (('toutatis', 'spin', 'state'), 6), (('doppler', 'radar', 'imaging'), 5), (('radar', 'speckle', 'tracking'), 5), (('principal', 'axis', 'spin'), 5), (('axis', 'spin', 'state'), 5)]",Dirty

It is difficult to make individual measurements more precise than this to investigate lower-amplitude nucleosynthetic effects, but population studies of mean abundance patterns can reveal more subtle abundance differences. Here we look at the detailed abundances for 67315 stars from APOGEE DR17, but in the form of abundance residuals away from a best-fit two-parameter, data-driven nucleosynthetic model. We find that these residuals show complex structures with respect to age, guiding radius, and vertical action that are not random and are also not strongly correlated with sources of systematic error such as surface gravity, effective temperature, and radial velocity. The residual patterns, especially in Na, C+N, Ni, Mn, and Ce, trace kinematic structures in the Milky Way, such as the inner disk, thick disk, and flared outer disk. A principal component analysis suggests that most of the observed structure is low-dimensional and can be explained by a few eigenvectors. We find that some, but not all, of the effects in the low-$\alpha$ disk can be explained by dilution with fresh gas, so that abundance ratios resemble those of stars with higher metallicity. The patterns and maps we provide could be combined with accurate forward models of nucleosynthesis, star formation, and gas infall to provide a more detailed picture of star and element formation in different Milky Way components., The element abundance pattern found in Milky Way disk stars is close to two-dimensional, dominated by production from one prompt process and one delayed process. This simplicity is remarkable, since the elements are produced by a multitude of nucleosynthesis mechanisms operating in stars with a wide range of progenitor masses. We fit the abundances of 14 elements for 48,659 red-giant stars from APOGEE Data Release 17 using a flexible, data-driven K-process model—dubbed KPM. In our fiducial model, with K = 2, each abundance in each star is described as the sum of a prompt and a delayed process contribution. We find that KPM with K = 2 is able to explain the abundances well, recover the observed abundance bimodality, and detect the bimodality over a greater range in metallicity than has previously been possible. We compare to prior work by Weinberg et al., finding that KPM produces similar results, but that KPM better predicts stellar abundances, especially for the elements C+N and Mn and for stars at supersolar metallicities. The model fixes the relative contribution of the prompt and delayed processes to two elements to break degeneracies and improve interpretability; we find that some of the nucleosynthetic implications are dependent upon these detailed choices. We find that moving to four processes adds flexibility and improves the model's ability to predict the stellar abundances, but does not qualitatively change the story. The results of KPM will help us to interpret and constrain the formation of the Galaxy disk, the relationship between abundances and ages, and the physics of nucleosynthesis., The element abundance pattern found by stellar spectroscopic surveys in Milky Way disk stars is close to two-dimensional, dominated by production from one prompt process and one delayed process. This simplicity is remarkable, since the elements are produced by a multitude of nucleosynthesis mechanisms operating in stars with a wide range of progenitor masses. We fit the abundances of 14 elements for 48,659 red-giant stars from APOGEE DR17 using a flexible, data-driven K-process model - dubbed KPM. In our fiducial model, with K=2, each abundance in each star is described as the sum of a prompt and a delayed process contribution. We find that KPM with K=2 is able to explain the abundances well, recover the observed abundance bimodality, and detect the bimodality over a greater range in metallicity than previously has been possible. We compare to prior work by Weinberg et al. (2022), finding that KPM produces similar results, but that KPM better predicts stellar abundances, especially for elements C+N and Mn and for stars at super-solar metallicities. The model makes assumptions, including that it fixes some parameters to break degeneracies and improve interpretability; we find that some of the nucleosynthetic implications are dependent upon these detailed parameter choices. We add a third and fourth process (to make K=4), finding that the additional processes give the model more freedom and improve the model's ability to predict the stellar abundances, as expected, but they don't qualitatively change the story. The results of KPM have implications for the formation of the Galaxy disk, the relationship between abundances and ages, and the physics of nucleosynthesis., We measure abundances of 12 elements (Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) in a sample of 86 metal-poor (-2 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ -1) subgiant stars in the solar neighborhood. Abundances are derived from high-resolution spectra taken with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope, modeled using iSpec and MOOG. By carefully quantifying the impact of photon-noise (&lt;0.05 dex for all elements), we robustly measure the intrinsic scatter of abundance ratios. At fixed [Fe/H], the rms intrinsic scatter in [X/Fe] ranges from 0.04 (Cr) to 0.16 dex (Na), with a median of 0.08 dex. Scatter in [X/Mg] is similar, and accounting for [α/Fe] only reduces the overall scatter moderately. We consider several possible origins of the intrinsic scatter with particular attention to fluctuations in the relative enrichment by core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and Type Ia supernovae and stochastic sampling of the CCSN progenitor mass distribution. The stochastic sampling scenario provides a good quantitative explanation of our data if the effective number of CCSN contributing to the enrichment of a typical sample star is N ~ 50. At the median metallicity of our sample, this interpretation implies that the CCSN ejecta are mixed over a gas mass ~6 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> before forming stars. The scatter of elemental abundance ratios is a powerful diagnostic test for simulations of star formation, feedback, and gas mixing in the early phases of the Galaxy., Our understanding of the origin of the elements is grounded in observational abundance measurements and theoretical models of stellar explosions. The current era of big data from surveys such as APOGEE and GALAH allows us to study an unprecedented number of stars in abundance space. I use spectroscopic data and theoretical supernovae yields to decode the nucleosynthetic contributions to over 20 elements and to constrain characteristics of Galactic enrichment. With the two-process model, which describes stellar abundances as the sum of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and Type-Ia supernovae components, I empirically determine the fractional contribution of prompt and delayed enrichment. By isolating the CCSN contributions, these results allow for sharp tests of CCSN models, including the landscape of black hole formation — which masses of massive stars explode and which collapse. I find that the chosen landscape affects the predicted abundance ratios, identify abundance ratios diagnostic of explodability, and that no explosion landscape can resolve the over-production of O relative to Mg in theoretical yields. Finally, I measure the abundances of low-metallicity stars to examine the possible sources of abundances scatter and to explore the effect of stochastic sampling of the IMF. At [Fe/H] of ~ -1.5, I find a median intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex in [X/Fe] which can be explained by stochastic enrichment from about 50 CCSN. My work demonstrates that median abundance trends and abundance scatter are powerful diagnostics of chemical evolution, CCSN explosion physics, star formation, and much more., We investigate the [X/Mg] abundances of 16 elements for 82,910 Galactic disk stars from GALAH+ DR3. We fit the median trends of low-Ia and high-Ia populations with a two-process model, which describes stellar abundances in terms of a prompt core-collapse and delayed Type-Ia supernova component. For each sample star, we fit the amplitudes of these two components and compute the residual Δ[X/H] abundances from this two-parameter fit. We find rms residuals ≲0.07 dex for well-measured elements and correlated residuals among some elements (such as Ba, Y, and Zn) that indicate common enrichment sources. From a detailed investigation of stars with large residuals, we infer that roughly 40% of the large deviations are physical and 60% are caused by problematic data such as unflagged binarity, poor wavelength solutions, and poor telluric subtraction. As one example of a population with distinctive abundance patterns, we identify 15 stars that have 0.3-0.6 dex enhancements of Na but normal abundances of other elements from O to Ni and positive average residuals of Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba. We measure the median elemental residuals of 14 open clusters, finding systematic ~0.1-0.4 dex enhancements of O, Ca, K, Y, and Ba and ~0.2 dex depletion of Cu in young clusters. Finally, we present a restricted three-process model where we add an asymptotic giant branch star (AGB) component to better fit Ba and Y. With the addition of the third process, we identify a population of stars, preferentially young, that have much higher AGB enrichment than expected from their SNIa enrichment., The landscape of black hole (BH) formation-in which massive stars explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and which implode into BHs-profoundly affects the initial-mass-function (IMF)-averaged nucleosynthetic yields of a stellar population. Building on the work of Sukhbold et al., we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar metallicity for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine models with extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation, and a model in which all stars from 8 to 120 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> explode. For plausible choices, the overall yields of α-elements span a factor of 3, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically 0.05-0.2 dex. To constrain the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or Mg are promising diagnostics. To distinguish complex, theoretically motivated landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni are promising because of their sensitivity to the core structure of the CCSN progenitors. We confirm previous findings of a substantial (factor 2.5-4) discrepancy between predicted O/Mg yield ratios and observationally inferred values, implying that models either overproduce O or underproduce Mg. No landscape choice achieves across-the-board agreement with observed abundance ratios; the discrepancies offer empirical clues to aspects of massive star evolution or explosion physics still missing from the models. We find qualitatively similar results using the massive star yields of Limongi &amp; Chieffi. We provide tables of IMF-integrated yields for several landscape scenarios, and more flexible user-designed models can be implemented through the publicly available Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE; https://pypi.org/project/vice/)., We compare abundance ratio trends in a sample of ∼11,000 Milky Way bulge stars (R<SUB>GC</SUB> &lt; 3 kpc) from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to those of APOGEE stars in the Galactic disk (5 kpc &lt; R<SUB>GC</SUB> &lt; 11 kpc). We divide each sample into low-Ia (high-[Mg/Fe]) and high-Ia (low-[Mg/Fe]) populations, and in each population, we examine the median trends of [X/Mg] versus [Mg/H] for elements X = Fe, O, Na, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ce. To remove small systematic trends of APOGEE abundances with stellar $\mathrm{log}(g)$ , we resample the disk stars to match the $\mathrm{log}(g)$ distributions of the bulge data. After doing so, we find nearly identical median trends for low-Ia disk and bulge stars for all elements. High-Ia trends are similar for most elements, with noticeable (0.05-0.1 dex) differences for Mn, Na, and Co. The close agreement of abundance trends (with typical differences ≲0.03 dex) implies that similar nucleosynthetic processes enriched bulge and disk stars despite the different star formation histories and physical conditions of these regions. For example, we infer that differences in the high-mass slope of the stellar initial mass function between disk and bulge must have been ≲0.30. This agreement, and the generally small scatter about the median sequences, means that one can predict all of a bulge star's APOGEE abundances with good accuracy knowing only its measured [Mg/Fe] and [Mg/H] and the observed trends of disk stars., Using a sample of 70,924 stars from the second data release of the GALAH optical spectroscopic survey, we construct median sequences of [X/Mg] versus [Mg/H] for 21 elements, separating the high-α/“low-Ia” and low-α/“high-Ia” stellar populations through cuts in [Mg/Fe]. Previous work with the near-IR APOGEE survey has shown that such sequences are nearly independent of location in the Galactic disk, implying that they are determined by stellar nucleosynthesis yields with little sensitivity to other chemical evolution aspects. The separation between the two [X/Mg] sequences indicates the relative importance of prompt and delayed enrichment mechanisms, while the sequences’ slopes indicate metallicity dependence of the yields. GALAH and APOGEE measurements agree for some of their common elements, but differ in sequence separation or metallicity trends for others. GALAH offers access to nine new elements. We infer that about 75% of solar C comes from core-collapse supernovae and 25% from delayed mechanisms. We find core-collapse fractions of 60%-80% for the Fe-peak elements Sc, Ti, Cu, and Zn, with strong metallicity dependence of the core-collapse Cu yield. For the neutron capture elements Y, Ba, and La, we infer large delayed contributions with non-monotonic metallicity dependence. The separation of the [Eu/Mg] sequences implies that at least ∼30% of Eu enrichment is delayed with respect to star formation. We compare our results to predictions of several supernova and asymptotic giant branch yield models; C, Na, K, Mn, and Ca all show discrepancies with models that could make them useful diagnostics of nucleosynthesis physics., While we observe a large amount of cold interstellar gas and dust in a subset of the early-type galaxy (ETG) population, the source of this material remains unclear. The two main, competing scenarios are external accretion of lower mass, gas-rich dwarfs, and internal production from stellar mass loss and/or cooling from the hot interstellar medium. We test these hypotheses with measurements of the stellar and nebular metallicities of three ETGs (NGC 2768, NGC 3245, and NGC 4694) from new long-slit, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs on the Large Binocular Telescope. These ETGs have modest star formation rates and minimal evidence of nuclear activity. We model the stellar continuum to derive chemical abundances and measure gas-phase abundances with standard nebular diagnostics. We find that the stellar and gas-phase abundances are very similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with the accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs. All three of these galaxies are also consistent with an extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation to higher mass galaxies with lower specific star formation rates. The emission-line flux ratios along the long-slit, as well as global line ratios clearly indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources including active galactic nucleus activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic waves, and single-degenerate Type Ia supernovae progenitors do not significantly affect the line ratios., Quasars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN), are known to vary in brightness on 10 day to 7 year timescales. While it has been proposed that this variability is caused by instability in the accretion disk, Poisson processes, or microlensing, the exact cause remains mysterious. Understanding the physical mechanisms that drive quasar variability will require imaging of quasars over a wide range of timescales. In particular, the observations required to constrain longer timescales can be difficult to conduct. This summer ~1000 quasars in Stripe 82 were observed in ugriz wavelength bands using WIRO, the University of Wyoming’s 2.3-meter telescope. Using these images, earlier data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's observations of Stripe 82, as well as various data reduction methods, the quasars’ magnitude can be studied on our extended 3 day to 15 year timescale. Here, we present the light curves of ~1000 quasars in ugriz bands as observed over the last 15 years.

The CGM plays a crucial role in the growth of galaxies; galaxies require a continuous gas supply to sustain star formation, and this gas accretion process is regulated by feedback from newly formed stars. However, observational analysis of the CGM is challenging. Not only because the low gas density makes the CGM difficult to image directly, but the CGM also consists of gas structures of different temperatures and densities. We will present our work on studying the kinematics of the cool (~10<SUP>4</SUP> K) and warm-hot (~10<SUP>5.5</SUP> K) CGM of low-redshift, star-forming galaxies. In particular, we will focus on the kinematics of the warm-hot gas traced by the highly ionized O VI absorption detected in sightlines of background quasars. We will compare our results with analyses from cosmological simulations and explain the observational bias that potentially affects the interpretation of observational data., The reservoir of baryons and metals surrounding galaxies is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM plays a crucial role in the growth of galaxies; galaxies require a continuous gas supply to sustain star formation, and this gas accretion process is regulated by feedback from newly formed stars. However, observational analysis of the CGM is challenging. Not only because the low gas density makes the CGM difficult to image directly, but the CGM is also multiphase, i.e., the CGM consists of gas structures of different temperatures and densities. We will present our ongoing projects of studying the multiphase circumgalactic gas flow. In particular, we will discuss our recent results on analyzing the kinematics of the circumgalactic gas traced by the highly ionized OVI absorption detected in background quasar sightlines of low-redshift, star-forming galaxies. We will contrast the results with that of the cool CGM traced by low-ionization-state ion, which is typically found to be corotating with the galaxy disks. Finally, we will also present analyses from cosmological simulations and compared that with the observed OVI gas kinematics., The high incidence rate of the O VI λλ1032, 1038 absorption around low-redshift, ~L <SUP>*</SUP> star-forming galaxies has generated interest in studies of the circumgalactic medium. We use the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the circumgalactic O VI gas around z ≈ 0.3 star-forming galaxies. Motivated by the limitation that observations do not reveal where the gas lies along the line of sight, we compare the O VI measurements produced by gas within fixed distances around galaxies and by gas selected using line-of-sight velocity cuts commonly adopted by observers. We show that gas selected by a velocity cut of ±300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> or ±500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> produces a higher O VI column density, a flatter column density profile, and a higher covering fraction compared to gas within 1, 2, or 3 times the virial radius (r <SUB>vir</SUB>) of galaxies. The discrepancy increases with impact parameter and worsens for lower-mass galaxies. For example, compared to the gas within 2 r <SUB>vir</SUB>, identifying the gas using velocity cuts of 200-500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> increases the O VI column density by 0.2 dex (0.1 dex) at 1 r <SUB>vir</SUB> to over 0.75 dex (0.7 dex) at ≈ 2 r <SUB>vir</SUB> for galaxies with stellar masses of 10<SUP>9</SUP>-10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). We furthermore estimate that excluding O VI outside r <SUB>vir</SUB> decreases the circumgalactic oxygen mass measured by Tumlinson et al. (2011) by over 50%. Our results demonstrate that gas at large line-of-sight separations but selected by conventional velocity windows has significant effects on the O VI measurements and may not be observationally distinguishable from gas near the galaxies., The observed growth in both the size and mass of galactic disks since redshift two requires an even larger increase in the specific angular momentum of the gas accreted from the circumgalactic medium, which is the only reservoir of gas that can sustain disk star formation for 10 billion years. The rotation of inflowing circumgalactic gas is therefore central to the development of the angular momentum of stellar disks. Observing gas accretion is complicated by the galactic outflows that feedback from massive stars drive out of the galactic plane. While the position angle and axis ratio describe the projected shape of the galactic disk, this leaves an ambiguity of which side of the galaxy minor axis tips toward the observer. This ambiguity produces degenerate solutions in modeling gas flows and identifying the origin of the observed gas, because observers do not know where the gas lies along line-of-sight. We propose new WFC3/UVIS imaging observation to map the spiral structures of 11 z=0.25 galaxies with circumgalactic Mg II absorption detected in the quasar sightlines. We will determine the 3D disk orientation using rotation curves and the wrapping direction of galaxy spiral arms. The imaging sample will be combined with 3 Mg II absorbing galaxies with spiral arms detected in archival images, bringing our sample to 14 galaxies. We collected high-resolution spectra of the quasars paired with the galaxies; these spectra resolved multiple Mg II components. The 3D orientation will constrain parameters of physical models (disks, radial inflow, and conical outflow) in individual sightlines. The measured gas flow properties will provide new constraints for models of disk growth., Low-ionization-state Mg II gas has been extensively studied in quasar sightline observations to understand the cool, ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> K gas in the circumgalactic medium. Motivated by recent observations showing that the Mg II gas around low-redshift galaxies has significant angular momentum, we use the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the morphological and rotation structures of the z ≈ 0.3 circumgalactic Mg II gas and examine how they change with the host galaxy properties. Around star-forming galaxies, we find that the Mg II gas has an axisymmetric instead of a spherical distribution, and the axis of symmetry aligns with that of the Mg II gas rotation. A similar rotating structure is less commonly found in the small sample of simulated quiescent galaxies. We also examine how often Mg II gas around galaxies selected using a line-of-sight velocity cut includes gas physically outside of the virial radius (r<SUB>vir</SUB>). For example, we show that at an impact parameter of 100 pkpc, a ±500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity cut around galaxies with stellar masses of 10<SUP>9</SUP>-10<SUP>9.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) selects Mg II gas beyond the virial radius 80% (6%) of the time. Because observers typically select Mg II gas around target galaxies using such a velocity cut, we discuss how this issue affects the study of circumgalactic Mg II gas properties, including the detection of corotation. While the corotating Mg II gas generally extends beyond 0.5r<SUB>vir</SUB>, the Mg II gas outside of the virial radius contaminates the corotation signal and makes observers less likely to conclude that gas at large impact parameters (e.g., ≳0.25r<SUB>vir</SUB>) is corotating., We constrain gas inflow speeds in star-forming galaxies with color gradients consistent with inside-out disk growth. Our method combines new measurements of disk orientation with previously described circumgalactic absorption in background quasar spectra. Two quantities, a position angle and an axis ratio, describe the projected shape of each galactic disk on the sky, leaving an ambiguity about which side of the minor axis is tipped toward the observer. This degeneracy regarding the 3D orientation of disks has compromised previous efforts to measure gas inflow speeds. We present Hubble Space Telescope and Keck/LGSAO imaging that resolves the spiral structure in five galaxies at redshift z ≈ 0.2. We determine the sign of the disk inclination for four galaxies, under the assumption that spiral arms trail the rotation. We project models for both radial infall in the disk plane and circular orbits onto each quasar sightline. We compare the resulting line-of-sight velocities to the observed velocity range of Mg II absorption in spectra of background quasars, which intersect the disk plane at radii between 69 and 115 kpc. For two sightlines, we constrain the maximum radial inflow speeds as 30-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also rule out a velocity component from radial inflow in one sightline, suggesting that the structures feeding gas to these growing disks do not have unity covering factor. We recommend appropriate selection criteria for building larger samples of galaxy-quasar pairs that produce orientations sensitive to constraining inflow properties., The growth of galactic disks requires a continuous gas supply, but direct observations of gas accretion onto galaxies remain rare. We analyze the kinematics of the low-ionization-state gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and study how the gas feeds the galactic disks. We have observed quasars behind z=0.2, star-forming galaxies, and the quasar sightlines intersect the CGM within 100 kpc of the foreground galaxies. We find that the Doppler shift of the circumgalactic gas absorption shares the same sign as the quasar side of the galactic disk, but the Doppler shifts are smaller than disk rotation predicts. Our results suggest that the low-ionization-state gas in the inner CGM corotates with the galactic disks, and centrifugal forces partially support the low-ionization-state gas. However, the circumgalactic absorption spans a broader velocity range than a thin rotating disk can explain, and we model the velocity range using a simple inflow model with gas spiraling inwards near the disk plane. We also use new, high-resolution imaging to reveal the wrapping direction of galaxy spiral arms, and we combine it with the galaxy rotation curve to deduce the orientation of the galactic disk in 3D-space. Using the 3D disk orientation as an additional parameter for the inflow model, we constrain the radial inflow speed or rule out a velocity component from radial inflow in the quasar sightline. We find inflow speeds comparable to that of the cold inflowing gas we have identified around galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations, where most of the EAGLE galaxies have mass inflow rates high enough to sustain the star-forming activities of the galaxies. We also find cold rotating disks with inflowing gas in EAGLE, and these disks extend to radii comparable to the impact parameters of our quasar sightlines around galaxies. Hence, using both observations and simulations, we conclude that the inner CGM has significant angular momentum, and our analysis with EAGLE further supports our inflow interpretation for the circumgalactic kinematic observations., How much of the circumgalactic medium around nearby galaxies is rotating? Quasar sightline observations reveal that the Doppler shift of low-ionization-state gas shares the sign expected from gas rotation in the disk plane. The projected velocities are lower than predicted for gas on circular orbits in a thin disk, suggesting that this cool gas will spiral towards the galactic disk. This result raises important questions about the kinematics of the warm-hot circumgalactic medium which must be rapidly cooling given its temperature near the peak of the radiative cooling curve. If this warm-hot phase is also corotating with the galactic disks, then it would seem likely that both phases of corotating gas are dynamically related. A number of HST/COS programs have established the prevalence of substantial column densities of O+5 ions in the halos of star-forming galaxies. These OVI absorbers are widely believed to trace the warm-hot phase, although alternative scenarios where the gas is photoionized instead of collisionally ionized imply different conditions. Several known examples of corotating OVI absorbers exist; yet a recent analysis of a small sample of galaxy - quasar pairs did not detect net corotation. We propose new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of eight quasars paired with galaxies for which we have measured rotation curves. We will combine these results with ground-based rotation curves for 15 galaxies having OVI detections in their existing COS spectra. If most of the OVI systems turn out to be corotating, then 23 pairs will be sufficient to obtain a statistically significant result., Numerous observations indicate that galaxies need a continuous gas supply to fuel star formation and explain the star formation history. However, direct observational evidence of gas accretion remains rare. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite, we study cold gas accretion onto galaxies and the observational signatures of the cold gas kinematics. For EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.27, we find that cold gas accretes onto galaxies anisotropically with typical inflow speeds between 20 and 60 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Most of these galaxies have comparable mass inflow rates and star formation rates, implying that the cold inflowing gas plausibly accounts for sustaining the star-forming activities of the galaxies. As motivation for future work to compare the cold gas kinematics with measurements from quasar sightline observations, we select an EAGLE galaxy with an extended cold gas disk, and we probe the cold gas using mock quasar sightlines. We demonstrate that by viewing the disk edge on, sightlines at azimuthal angles below 10° and impact parameters out to 60 pkpc can detect cold gas that corotates with the galaxy disk. This example suggests that cold gas disks extending beyond the optical disks possibly explain the sightline observations that detect corotating cold gas near galaxy major axes., Galactic disks grow by accreting cooling gas from the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Decades of observations have also demonstrated that galaxies need a continuous gas supply to explain the star formation history and the stellar metallicity distribution of disks. However, direct observations of gas accretion onto galaxies remain sparse. I will present results of our survey that measures the kinematics of low-ionization-state gas in the CGM. We have observed quasars behind star-forming galaxies at z=0.2, and the quasar sightlines pass within 100 kpc of the foreground galaxies. We find that the Doppler shift of the circumgalactic absorption shares the same sign as the quasar side of the galactic disk, but the Doppler shifts are smaller than disk rotation predicts. The Doppler sign correlation implies the low-ionization-state gas in the inner CGM corotates with the disk. Altogether, our results indicate centrifugal force partially supports the circumgalactic gas, and therefore the angular momentum of the CGM delays accretion onto the disk. We have modeled the absorption kinematics using an inflow model with gas spiraling inwards near the disk plane. The model predicts the 3D orientation of the disk, which we test with new measurements. Our results suggest galaxies typically have inflow speeds of around 40 km/s, comparable to that of the cold inflowing gas we have identified around galaxies in the EAGLE simulations. We also find cold rotating gas disks with inflowing gas in EAGLE, and these disks extend to radii comparable to the impact parameters of our quasar sightlines around galaxies. Our analysis with EAGLE thereby further supports our inflow interpretation for the circumgalactic kinematic observations., Galactic disks grow by accreting cooling gas from the circumgalactic medium, and yet direct observations of inflowing gas remain sparse. We observed quasars behind star-forming galaxies and measured the kinematics of circumgalactic absorption. Near the galaxy plane, the Mg II Doppler shifts share the same sign as the galactic rotation, which implies the gas co-rotates with the galaxy disk. However, a rotating disk model fails to explain the observed broad velocity range. Gas spiraling inward near the disk plane offers a plausible explanation for the lower velocity gas. We will discuss the sizes of these circumgalactic disks, the properties of their host galaxies, and predictions for the spiral arms. Our results provide direct evidence for cold gas accretion at redshift z=0.2., We describe the kinematics of circumgalactic gas near the galactic plane, combining new measurements of galaxy rotation curves and spectroscopy of background quasars. The sightlines pass within 19-93 kpc of the target galaxy and generally detect Mg II absorption. The Mg II Doppler shifts have the same sign as the galactic rotation, so the cold gas co-rotates with the galaxy. Because the absorption spans a broader velocity range than disk rotation can explain, we explore simple models for the circumgalactic kinematics. Gas spiraling inwards (near the disk plane) offers a successful description of the observations. An appendix describes the addition of tangential and radial gas flows and illustrates how the sign of the disk inclination produces testable differences in the projected line-of-sight velocity range. This inflow interpretation implies that cold flow disks remain common down to redshift z ≈ 0.2 and prolong star formation by supplying gas to the disk. <P />Some of the observations were obtained with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 meter telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium., We analyze the magnetic field data recorded by ELF antennas operated by ISUAL project of NCKU at Lulin Observatory in Taiwan at low-latitudinal region (120°52' 25""E , 23°28' 07"" N, 2862m). The data adopted in this analysis is from 2008 to 2009 with wave signals below 200Hz primarily studied. The signals are measured in both H (north-south) and D (east-west) components. Therefore, we focus on developing computing codes to derive parameters associated with their polarizations from these two observed components, based on quasi-monochromatic theory and coherency matrix from physical optics. From the coherency matrix, a partially polarized signal can be separated into its polarized and unpolarized parts. The ellipticity, orientation, and sense of polarization for the polarized portion can then be calculated in terms of the matrix elements using power and cross-power spectral analysis techniques. The degree of polarization can finally be obtained. The variations of polarizations will be used to find where the emissions originate. Their correlations with both the geomagnetic activities and seismic activities will also be extensively investigated. This will be beneficial to our understanding on whether the detected ELF-emissions are from geomagnetic or seismic activities., ","['2024AAS...24331201H', '2023AAS...24144807H', 'arXiv:2110.01633', '10.48550/arXiv.2110.01633', '2021arXiv211001633H', '2021ApJ...923..137H', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac2c73', '2021hst..prop16742H', '10.3847/1538-4357/abbe88', 'arXiv:2010.02944', '2020ApJ...904...76H', '2020arXiv201002944H', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.02944', '2019arXiv190111182H', '10.48550/arXiv.1901.11182', 'arXiv:1901.11182', '2020ApJ...888...14H', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab58cd', '2019PhDT........98H', '2019PhDT.......138H', '2019hst..prop15866H', '2019ApJ...875...54H', '2019arXiv190306840H', 'arXiv:1903.06840', '10.48550/arXiv.1903.06840', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab0ec2', '2019AAS...23323904H', '2017gefb.confE..20H', '10.5281/zenodo.836945', 'arXiv:1611.04579', '2017ApJ...835..267H', '2016arXiv161104579H', '10.48550/arXiv.1611.04579', '10.3847/1538-4357/835/2/267', '2010AGUFMSA11B1590H', '2008GeCAS..72Q.382H']","[('gas', 96), ('galaxy', 70), ('disk', 56), ('circumgalactic', 29), ('quasar', 25), ('star', 23), ('cgm', 21), ('inflow', 19), ('observation', 18), ('velocity', 18)]","[(('mg', 'ii'), 18), (('galactic', 'disk'), 13), (('star', 'forming'), 12), (('ii', 'gas'), 11), (('cold', 'gas'), 11), (('circumgalactic', 'medium'), 10), (('forming', 'galaxy'), 10), (('star', 'formation'), 8), (('gas', 'accretion'), 8), (('quasar', 'sightlines'), 8)]","[(('mg', 'ii', 'gas'), 11), (('star', 'forming', 'galaxies'), 10), (('low', 'ionization', 'state'), 8), (('ionization', 'state', 'gas'), 6), (('continuous', 'gas', 'supply'), 5), (('circumgalactic', 'medium', 'cgm'), 4), (('gas', 'circumgalactic', 'medium'), 4), (('low', 'redshift', 'star'), 3), (('redshift', 'star', 'forming'), 3), (('line', 'sight', 'velocity'), 3)]",Dirty

The relationship converting measured emission line fluxes to absolute accretion rates for T Tauri stars has been determined empirically down to substellar masses, but a robust relationship calibrated for objects of planetary mass is yet to be determined. In this presentation, I will discuss preliminary results from a Keck pilot study to measure the accretion rates of planetary-mass objects using UV/optical and IR spectroscopy. The spectra of the planetary-mass objects in our sample are obtained near-simultaneously with both Keck-I/LRIS and Keck-II/NIRSPEC to ensure our L<SUB>acc</SUB>-L<SUB>line</SUB> relationship determinations are robust to variability in accretion. I will also discuss the first detections of Paβ and Brα in FU Tau A, a ~50 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> brown dwarf host of a ~15 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> planetary-mass companion, and their implications for accretion variability and brown dwarf formation scenarios in this benchmark system. Our Keck campaign will calibrate and extend empirical relationships between hydrogen recombination line fluxes and accretion luminosity down to planetary masses. These observations will place the first UV-calibrated constraints on Brα emission in accreting substellar objects, and I will conclude my presentation with discussion of the outlook for using infrared hydrogen emission lines as a protoplanet search strategy in the era of JWST., Transitioning from directly imaging a small number of exoplanets with masses below 5 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> on orbits with semi-major axes less than 15 au to directly characterizing the plethora of systems discovered by exoplanet-finding missions (i.e., Kepler and TESS) requires mitigating technical challenges. Developing instruments that overcome current limitations will help complete the planet demographic census and answer fundamental questions regarding exoplanet formation and evolution, including the origins of our own solar system. <P />The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES; Skemer et al. 2018) is an under-construction thermal infrared high-contrast integral field spectrograph that will sit behind the 10-m Keck telescope Adaptive Optics system. SCALES is also the precursor to the TMT Planetary System Imager's red arm (PSI-Red; Fitzgerald et al. 2018, Skemer et al. 2018). SCALES will detect and characterize planets that have never been accessible to detailed study before in two key ways. By operating at mid-infrared (2-5 μm) wavelengths, SCALES will observe planets at wavelengths where they are brightest, and by leveraging integral-field spectroscopy, SCALES will readily distinguish between exoplanets and residual starlight. <P />In this presentation, I will discuss my on-going work to prepare for the future of exoplanet observations with SCALES and planned ground-based 30-m telescopes. I will introduce SCALES' instrument design and broader science goals, then report on the preliminary designs of SCALES observing modes that will enable the study of accreting protoplanets. I will describe scalessim (Briesemeister et al., in prep), SCALES' pipeline and observation simulator, and how I am utilizing it to develop higher resolution observing modes that will ascertain the kinds of infall geometries and accretion characteristics SCALES could potentially constrain, which would ultimately inform optomechanical choices to be incorporated into the final SCALES instrument design. I will then conclude with a discussion of my plans to create and execute science verification observations following instrument commissioning expected in 2025., By paraphrasing one of Kipling's most amazing short stories (How the Leopard Got His Spots), this article could be entitled ""How Sugars Became Homochiral"". Obviously, we have no answer to this still unsolved mystery, and this perspective simply brings recent models, experiments and hypotheses into the homochiral homogeneity of sugars on earth. We shall revisit the past and current understanding of sugar chirality in the context of prebiotic chemistry, with attention to recent developments and insights. Different scenarios and pathways will be discussed, from the widely known formose-type processes to less familiar ones, often viewed as unorthodox chemical routes. In particular, problems associated with the spontaneous generation of enantiomeric imbalances and the transfer of chirality will be tackled. As carbohydrates are essential components of all cellular systems, astrochemical and terrestrial observations suggest that saccharides originated from environmentally available feedstocks. Such substances would have been capable of sustaining autotrophic and heterotrophic mechanisms integrating nutrients, metabolism and the genome after compartmentalization. Recent findings likewise indicate that sugars' enantiomeric bias may have emerged by a transfer of chirality mechanisms, rather than by deracemization of sugar backbones, yet providing an evolutionary advantage that fueled the cellular machinery., Silicates are ubiquitous in space. They dominate the surfaces of the inner rocky planets (Mercury in the case of the Solar System), the Moon, and asteroids, forming the major part of the non-volatile material. The physical and chemical properties of the rocky surfaces are determined not only by their initial composition but also by the processes occurring on them. Here we discuss one of these processes; irradiation by energetic cosmic particles that induces many effects among which structural changes and sputtering, the latter contributing to the formation of exospheres. In the current work we report the results of experiments conducted on anorthite, jadeite and nepheline silicates that have been irradiated with energetic heavy ions with the aim to better understand the interaction of galactic cosmic rays, solar wind, and solar energetic particles with planetary and small body surfaces. The sputtering effects induced by energetic (MeV/u) multicharged heavy ions (e.g., <SUP>105</SUP>Rh and <SUP>140</SUP>Ba) were analyzed by the PDMS-TOF-SIMS technique (plasma desorption mass spectrometry - time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry). Positive and negative secondary ionic species are identified: Na<SUP>+</SUP>, K<SUP>+</SUP>, Al<SUP>+</SUP>, Ca<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>. Ejection of (SiO<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> and (AlSi)O<SUB>m</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> cluster series are also observed. Less frequent, negative ion yields are one order of magnitude less than positive ones, or greater, which is the case for nepheline, with 0.671 ions impact<SUP>-1</SUP> for positive and 0.126 ions impact<SUP>-1</SUP> for negative ions. The results concerning ejection of ionic species show, for instance, that the Na<SUP>+</SUP>/K<SUP>+</SUP> ratio is ~2.5, which is in very good agreement with that observed in the Hermean exosphere found to be ~2.3., The atmospheres and accretion disks of planetary-mass and substellar companions provide an unprecedented look into planet and moon formation processes, most notably the frequency and lifetime of circumplanetary disks. In our ongoing effort to leverage the extraordinary sensitivity of the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm to study wide planetary-mass and substellar companions near the diffraction limit, we present point-spread function fitting photometry of archival Spitzer/IRAC images for nine stars (G0 to M4+M7) in nearby star-forming regions or stellar associations that host companions at separations of ρ = 1.″17-12.″33. We detect all system primaries in all four IRAC channels and recover eight low-mass companions in at least one IRAC channel for our sample, five of which have not been resolved previously in IRAC images. We measure nonphotospheric [3.6]-[8.0] colors for four of the system companions (DH Tau B, 2M0441 B, SR 12 c, and ROXs 42B b), confirming or discovering the presence of circumstellar or circum(sub)stellar disks. We detect fluxes consistent with photospheric emission for four other companions (AB Pic b, CHXR 73 b, 1RXS J1609 b, and HD 203030 b) that are unlikely to host disks. Combined with past detections of accretion or disk indicators, we determine the global disk frequency of young (&lt;15 Myr) wide companions with masses near the deuterium-burning limit to be 56% ± 12%., The last decade has seen the discovery of a growing population of planetary-mass companions (≲20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>; PMCs) to young stars which are often still in the star-forming regions where they formed. These objects have been found at wide separations (&gt;100 au) from their host stars, challenging existing models of both star and planet formation. Demographic trends with mass and separation should distinguish between these formation models. While the number of wide-orbit PMCs known has increased slowly, there is tremendous opportunity to search for wide companions in publicly available legacy data sets (e.g., Spitzer/IRAC, Pan-STARRS, UKIDSS, VHS). Furthermore, with the Gaia mission revolutionizing our understanding of the stars in the Milky Way by precisely mapping their positions and movements, an additional opportunity arises to efficiently discover more wide substellar and planetary-mass companions. In this talk I will present my efforts to increase the number of wide-orbit PMCs known through an automated PSF-subtraction pipeline I developed. I will then present how I utilized Gaia to confirm a ρ = 4.66"" (540 au), M = 20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> companion to [SCH06] J0359+2009, a young brown dwarf in Taurus, and describe my ongoing follow-up observations to characterize this system. Finally, I will conclude by reviewing the outlook for future Gaia data releases and how it will further our understanding of binary systems into the planetary-mass regime., We obtained photometric observations of KELT-25 b and KELT-26 b from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) Follow-Up Network. Details about instruments and observations are available in Table2. <P />(4 data files)., The last decade has seen the discovery of a growing population of planetary-mass companions (~&lt;20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>; hereafter PMCs) to young stars which are often still in the star-forming regions where they formed. These objects have been found at wide separations (&gt;100 AU) from their host stars, challenging existing models of both star and planet formation. Demographic trends with mass and separation should distinguish between these formation models. The extensive Spitzer/IRAC data set of every major star-forming region and association within 300 pc has great potential to be mined for wide companions to stars. I will present new results from my automated pipeline to find wide-orbit companions of stars via point spread function (PSF) subtraction in Spitzer/IRAC images. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is the backbone of this PSF subtraction routine that efficiently creates and subtracts χ<SUP>2</SUP>-minimizing instrumental PSFs, measuring infrared photometry of the systems across the four IRAC channels (3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, 5.8 μm, and 8 μm). I will present a re-analysis of archival Spitzer/IRAC images of 11 young, low-mass (44 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>-0.88 M<SUB>Sun</SUB>; K3.5-M7.5) stars in 3 nearby star-forming regions (Chameleon, Taurus, and Upper Scorpius; d ~ 150 pc; τ ~ 1-10 Myr) known to host faint companions over a range of projected separations (1.7""-7.3""). I will discuss the characteristics of the systems found to have low-mass companions with non-zero [I1] - [I4] colors, including the confirmation of a ρ = 4.66"" (540 AU), M = 20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> companion to [SCH06] J0359+2009, a young brown dwarf in Taurus. My survey is sensitive to companions with masses approaching that of Jupiter at orbital radii of a few hundred AU, discovering wide PMCs in their birth environments and revealing their circum(sub)stellar disks. I will present my newest results in measuring the mid-IR photometry of substellar companions that have been directly imaged at optical or near-IR wavelengths and an automated companion search of all known young stars with existing Spitzer/IRAC data, concluding with my ongoing follow-up observations of candidate wide PMC systems with ground-based telescopes and the outlook for future observations with space-based telescopes., Direct imaging surveys have discovered wide-orbit planetary-mass companions that challenge existing models of both star and planet formation, but their demographics remain poorly sampled. We have developed an automated binary companion point-spread function (PSF) fitting pipeline to take advantage of Spitzer's infrared sensitivity to planetary-mass objects and circum(sub)stellar disks, measuring photometry across the four Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) channels of 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm. We present PSF fitting photometry of archival Spitzer/IRAC images for 11 young, low-mass (M ∼ 0.044-0.88 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> K3.5-M7.5) members of three nearby star-forming regions (Chameleon, Taurus, and Upper Scorpius; d ∼ 150 pc; τ ∼ 1-10 Myr) that host confirmed or candidate faint companions at ρ = 1.″68-7.″31. We recover all system primaries, six confirmed, and two candidate low-mass companions in our sample. We also measure nonphotospheric [3.6]-[8.0] colors for three of the system primaries, four of the confirmed companions, and one candidate companion, signifying the presence of circumstellar or circum(sub)stellar disks. We furthermore report the confirmation of a ρ = 4.″66 (540 au) companion to [SCH06] J0359+2009 which was previously identified as a candidate via imaging over five years ago, but was not studied further. Based on its brightness (M <SUB>[3.6]</SUB> = 8.53 mag), we infer the companion mass to be M = 20 ± 5 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> given the primary’s model-derived age of 10 Myr. Our framework is sensitive to companions with masses less than 10 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> at separations of ρ = 300 au in nearby star-forming regions, opening up a new regime of parameter space that has yet to be studied in detail, discovering planetary-mass companions in their birth environments and revealing their circum(sub)stellar disks., The last decade has seen the discovery of a growing population of planetary-mass companions ( &lt;20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>; PMCs) to young stars which are often still in the star-forming regions where they formed. These objects have been found at wide separations (&gt;100 AU) from their host stars, challenging existing models of both star and planet formation. Demographic trends with mass and separation should distinguish between these formation models. <P />The extensive Spitzer/IRAC data set of major star-forming regions and associations within 300 pc has great potential to be mined for wide companions to stars.

I will discuss the characteristics and disk-hosting potential of the systems found to have low-mass companions with non-zero [3.6] - [8] colors, including the confirmation of a ρ = 4. 66"" (540 AU), M = 20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> companion to [SCH06] J0359+2009, a young brown dwarf in Taurus. <P />My survey is sensitive to companions with masses near that of Jupiter at orbital radii of a few hundred AU, discovering wide PMCs in their birth environments and revealing their circum(sub)stellar disks. I will present my newest results in measuring the mid-IR photometry of directly-imaged substellar companions and an automated companion search of all known young stars with existing Spitzer/IRAC data, concluding with my ongoing follow-up of candidate wide PMC systems with ground-based telescopes and the outlook for future observations with space-based telescopes., , We propose a new SU(3)C ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y ⊗ U(1)X gauge model which is non universal respect to the three fermion families of the Standard Model. We introduce additional one top-like quark, two bottom-like quarks and three right handed neutrinos in order to have an anomaly free theory. We also consider additional three right handed neutrinos which are singlets respect to the gauge symmetry of the model to implement see saw mechanism and give masses to the light neutrinos according to the neutrino oscillation phenomenology. In the context of this horizontal gauge symmetry we find mass ansatz for leptons and quarks. In particular, from the analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, we get the allow region for the Yukawa couplings for the charge and neutral lepton sectors according with the mass squared differences and mixing angles for the two neutrino hierarchy schemes, normal and inverted., Adaptive-optics imaging of nearby star-forming regions has found a population of wide-orbit, planetary-mass companions (PMCs), indicating these objects are a normal product of star and planet formation. It is unclear whether these systems represent the low-mass extreme of stellar binary formation, or the high-mass and wide-orbit extreme of planet formation. The final determination of which theory prevails will require a statistical sample of PMCs from which general properties and demographics can be obtained, as well as detailed characterization of each rare discovery.The large separation (&gt;2"") and moderate contrast between a PMC and its host star make such systems amenable to direct imaging and spectroscopic study. While the dominant formation mechanism of PMCs remains to be determined, if they did form similarly to planets, studying PMC atmospheres and accretion would provide insight into the gas giant planets that orbit closer to their host stars.FW Tau is a close binary system that harbors a third component whose nature is still a matter of debate. By obtaining ALMA Cycle 1 observations and modeling the SED, Caceres et al. (2015) find the companion to be consistent with either being a brown dwarf embedded in an edge-on disk or a planet embedded in a low inclination disk. More recent ALMA Cycle 3 observations and disk modeling from Wu &amp; Sheehan (2017) suggest the embedded brown dwarf solution. Spectroscopic observations have found the companion to be accreting and driving outflows, but also have failed to detect any photospheric features. In this work, we present observations of FW Tau with the newly commissioned 9 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) second generation Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS2). We have obtained &gt;8 hours of data over 12 nights in an attempt to detect the continuum of FW Tau’s third component. We will describe the LRS2 integral-field unit and provide details of our observing strategy. We will detail the data reduction pipeline and current progress in combining our observations to produce a detection of the tertiary component’s continuum. We will conclude by discussing our plans to further characterize this potential planetary-mass companion caught in mid-assembly., Over the past decade, a growing population of planetary-mass companions (&lt; 20 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> PMCs) orbiting young stars have been discovered. These objects are at wide separations (&gt; 100 AU) from their host stars, challenging existing models of both star and planet formation. It is unclear whether these systems represent the low-mass extreme of stellar binary formation or the high-mass and wide-orbit extreme of planet formation theories, as various proposed formation pathways inadequately explain the physical and orbital aspects of these systems. Even so, determining which scenario best reproduces the observed characteristics of the PMCs will come once a statistically robust sample of directly-imaged PMCs are found and studied.We are developing an automated pipeline to search for wide-orbit PMCs to young stars in Spitzer/IRAC images. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is the backbone of our novel point spread function (PSF) subtraction routine that efficiently creates and subtracts χ<SUP>2</SUP>-minimizing instrumental PSFs, simultaneously measuring astrometry and infrared photometry of these systems across the four IRAC channels (3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, 5.8 μm, and 8 μm). In this work, we present the results of a Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging study of 11 young, low-mass (0.044-0.88 M⊙ K3.5-M7.5) stars known to have faint, low-mass companions in 3 nearby star-forming regions (Chameleon, Taurus, and Upper Scorpius). We characterize the systems found to have low-mass companions with non-zero [I1] - [I4] colors, potentially signifying the presence of a circum(sub?)stellar disk.

Initial runs of the pipeline have recovered 7 of the companions from the 11 systems. An additional binary companion PSF-fitting pipeline is being developed to simultaneously measure astrometry and infrared photometry of these systems across the four IRAC channels (3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, 5.8 μm, and 8 μm).

Phasing optics systems must reduce segment misalignments to guarantee the high optical quality required for astronomical science programs. Modern telescopes routinely use adaptive optics systems to compensate for the atmosphere and use laser-guide-stars to create artificial stars as bright references in the field of observation. Because multiple laser-guide-star adaptive optics are being implemented in all major observatories, we propose to use man-made stars not only for adaptive optics, but for phasing optics. We propose a method called the doublet-wavelength coherence technique (DWCT), exploiting the D lines of sodium in the mesosphere using laser guide-stars. The signal coherence properties are then used. The DWCT capture range exceeds current abilities by a factor of 100. It represents a change in paradigm by improving the phasing optics capture range from micrometric to millimetric. It thereby potentially eliminates the need of a man-made mechanical pre-phasing step. Extremely large telescopes require hundreds of segments, several of which need to be substituted on a daily basis to be recoated. The DWCT relaxes mechanical integration requirements and speeds up integration and re-integration process., We propose a U<SUP>(1) ‧</SUP> extension of the standard model with the addition of three quark singlets, two scalar singlets and one scalar doublet. By introducing mixing couplings between ordinary and exotic fermions ruled by global symmetries, we obtain mass relations among quarks with few parameters The model exhibits a ""natural"" scenery where a hierarchical mass spectrum can be obtained by providing Yukawa couplings with a nearly symmetric structure., We explore constraints on the scalar coupling in a family nonuniversal U (1 <SUP>)'</SUP> extension of the standard model free from anomalies with a complex scalar dark matter particle. From unitarity and stability of the Higgs potential, we find the full set of bounds and order relations for the scalar coupling constants. Using recent data from the CERN-LHC collider, we study the signal strength of the diphoton Higgs decay, which imposes very stringent bounds to the scalar couplings and other scalar parameters, including parameters associated to the dark matter. Taking into account these constraints, the observable relic density of the Universe, and the limits from LUX collaboration for direct detection, we obtain allowed masses for the dark matter particle as low as 55 GeV. By assuming that the lightest scalar boson of the model corresponds to the observed Higgs boson, we evaluate deviations from the standard model of the trilineal Higgs self-coupling. The conditions from unitarity, stability and Higgs diphoton decay data allow trilineal deviations in the range 0 ≤δ g ≲-72 %., In the interstellar medium, high-energy cosmic rays are able to penetrate deeply into molecular clouds, resulting in the ionization and dissociation of condensed molecules on ice-grain surfaces, which in turn leads to the desorption of a number of species. The interpretation of interstellar data requires qualitative and quantitative studies of the molecular species formed in several processes. In this work, the interaction of cosmic rays with CO-NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice is simulated by the bombardment of ∼65-MeV heavy ions (masses of ∼100 u) on frozen gases. Positive and negative ions ejected from the ice surface as a consequence of the impact are analysed through time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The dependence of the ion desorption yield on the sample temperature (which varies/increases with time) has been used to discuss the emission process of the desorbed ions, especially near ice sublimation temperatures (∼30 K for CO at 10<SUP>-8</SUP> mbar); at these temperatures, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, NO<SUP>+</SUP>, NH<SUB>3</SUB>OH<SUP>+</SUP> and NH<SUB>3</SUB>CO<SUP>+</SUP> are formed and emitted. For temperatures in the 40 to 65 K range, mass spectra of positive ions are dominated by the NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> ion peak, similarly to what occurs for a pure frozen NH<SUB>3</SUB> target. Concerning the mass spectra of negative ions, the total yield of negative ions at T = 25 K is found to be about 20 times lower than that of positive ions. Before CO sublimation, CN-bearing species are formed, among which the cyanide ions CN<SUP>-</SUP> and OCN<SUP>-</SUP> are by far the most abundant species. These findings support the idea that NH<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and OCN<SUP>-</SUP> ions are efficiently formed by the interaction of cosmic rays with CO-NH<SUB>3</SUB> ices., In the framework of a nonuniversal U (1 )<SUP>'</SUP>extension of the standard model, we propose a scalar candidate for cold dark matter which exhibits interactions with ordinary matter through Higgs and gauge bosons. Using limits from low energy observables, we find constraints on the new physics parameters of the model associated to the extra Abelian symmetry, especially the mass of the additional neutral gauge boson Z<SUP>'</SUP>and the new gauge coupling constant. We find that for the lower experimental limit M<SUB>Z<SUP>'</SUP></SUB>=3 TeV constrained by direct research at LHC, the ratio between the U (1)<SUP>'</SUP> and S U (2 )<SUB>L</SUB> gauge coupling constants is around 0.4. Taking into account this limit and the observable relic density of the Universe, we search for new constraints on the mass of the dark matter particle of the model. We find that for a Higgsphobic model, the mass of the scalar dark matter must be M<SUB>σ</SUB>=70 GeV . We also find different kinematical threshold and resonances that enhance the dispersion of dark matter into ordinary matter for different regions of the space of parameters of the model, obtaining masses as low as 1.3 GeV and as large as 125 GeV without allowed intermediate regions due to resonances., All-sky mapping performed by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns has identified 346 nearby Hipparcos stars as warm debris disk candidate sources with [3.4]-[22] colors indicative of excess 22 micron emission above that expected of the stellar photosphere at a better than 4-sigma level. A considerable number of additional nearby Hipparcos stars show 22 micron color excess but at lower significance due to saturation of the W1 (3.4 micron) images. Here, we present Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Channel 1 (3.6 micron) subarray mode observations of 421 Hipparcos stars within 120 pc ranging in spectral type from B3 to M9 and assess their potential as warm debris disk candidates. We confirm 169 of these low-significance color excesses by performing aperture photometry on the new, unsaturated Spitzer/IRAC Ch 1 images. We also detail our Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting strategy that enabled accurate subtraction of the stellar photosphere to improve confidence of one-hundred and four 22 micron excess detections to better than 4-sigma significance. After careful scrutiny of the images in our sample to exclude sources plagued by contamination or confusion, 79 stars have excess 22 micron emission attributable to debris disks. The spectral type breakdown of these infrared excess objects are as follows; 11 B stars, 39 A stars, 25 F stars, and 4 G stars. Of these 79 infrared excess stars, 55 are newly identified., The eclipsing binary star system θ<SUB>1</SUB> Orionis B<SUB>1</SUB> (variable star designation BM Ori) is the faintest member of the four star Trapezium, located at the heart of the Orion Nebula. The primary is a B3 star on or near the ZAMS and the secondary appears to be an evolving, disk-shaped object based on its unusual light curve. In an effort to better understand the components of this system we have obtained 53 high-resolution (R=120,000) spectra taken by the 9.2-meter Hobby-Eberly Telescope gathered over a span of 45 days in late 2008 and early 2009. The spectral range of the data is from 4000Å to 8000Å. In addition to being some of the highest signal-to-noise data ever taken of BM Ori, these spectra offer excellent coverage of BM Ori’s ~6.47 day period, including ingress and egress of the primary transit and secondary minimum. We search for any anomalous spectral signature of the secondary, such as excess NaI gas absorption due to transit of a circumstellar disk. We detect variability in the Hα line profile and characterize its behavior. We have also identified He lines of the primary and numerous metal lines of the secondary, including MgI, TiII, and LiI. We will present the results of a full spectral analysis, including a refined radial velocity curve, newly constrained mass ratio, and other basic stellar parameters (e.g. T<SUP>eff</S","['2024ESS.....562108M', '2023AAS...24134609M', '2022OLEB..tmp....8M', '2022OLEB...52...21M', '10.1007/s11084-022-09624-9', '2022Icar..37514830M', '10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114830', '2021arXiv211103087M', 'arXiv:2111.03087', '2022AJ....163...36M', '10.3847/1538-3881/ac3745', '10.48550/arXiv.2111.03087', '2021DDA....5230103M', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51600111', '2020yCat..51600111M', '2020AAS...23513202M', '10.48550/arXiv.1907.06767', 'arXiv:1907.06767', '10.3847/1538-3881/ab32e6', '2019arXiv190706767M', '2019AJ....158..134M', '2019ESS.....432209M', '2019pds..data..101M', '10.17189/1523031', '10.48550/arXiv.1802.06320', '2018EPJWC.18202084M', 'arXiv:1802.06320', '2018arXiv180206320M', '10.1051/epjconf/201818202084', '2018AAS...23124625M', '2017AAS...23011806M', '2017AAS...22914617M', '10.48550/arXiv.1607.08351', '2016arXiv160708351M', 'arXiv:1607.08351', '10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.10.065', '2016NPPP..273.2790M', '2014arXiv1411.1641M', '10.1103/PhysRevD.92.035016', 'arXiv:1411.1641', '2015PhRvD..92c5016M', '10.48550/arXiv.1411.1641', '10.1093/mnras/stu1400', '2014MNRAS.444.3317M', '2014PhRvD..90i5004M', '2014arXiv1408.5153M', 'arXiv:1408.5153', '10.1103/PhysRevD.90.095004', '10.48550/arXiv.1408.5153', '2014hwat.confE..31M', '2013AAS...22125630M', 'arXiv:1009.1015', '10.48550/arXiv.1009.1015', '2010arXiv1009.1015M', '2004A&A...419..965M', '10.1051/0004-6361:20035635', '2004SPIE.5275..204M', '10.1117/12.548363']","[('star', 70), ('mass', 65), ('companion', 54), ('system', 36), ('wide', 28), ('irac', 26), ('model', 24), ('formation', 23), ('disk', 22), ('low', 22)]","[(('planetary', 'mass'), 19), (('mass', 'companion'), 19), (('low', 'mass'), 16), (('star', 'forming'), 15), (('forming', 'region'), 15), (('spitzer', 'irac'), 14), (('irac', 'image'), 10), (('nearby', 'star'), 10), (('planet', 'formation'), 10), (('wide', 'orbit'), 10)]","[(('star', 'forming', 'regions'), 14), (('nearby', 'star', 'forming'), 10), (('planetary', 'mass', 'companions'), 9), (('low', 'mass', 'companions'), 8), (('spitzer', 'irac', 'images'), 7), (('star', 'planet', 'formation'), 7), (('point', 'spread', 'function'), 6), (('circum', 'stellar', 'disks'), 6), (('existing', 'models', 'star'), 6), (('models', 'star', 'planet'), 6)]",Dirty

These winds collide with the surrounding gas producing shock-heated (T ~ 10<SUP>7</SUP>~K) tenuous gas that adiabatically expands and pushes on the dense gas that may otherwise be accreted. In this talk, I will present a series of 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive prestellar cores and include radiative feedback from the direct stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, collimated outflows, and, for the first time, isotropic stellar winds to model how these processes affect the formation of massive (proto)stars. I find that winds are initially launched when the massive protostar is still accreting and that the stellar wind properties evolve as it contracts to the main sequence. Wind feedback drives asymmetric adiabatic wind bubbles that have a bipolar morphology because the dense circumstellar accretion disk pinches the expansion of the hot shock-heated gas, which preferentially expands along low-density channels. I term this the ""wind tunnel effect"". Eventually, the shock-heated gas produced by stellar winds quenches accretion onto massive stars that form from isolated cores when they reach ~30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Hence, stars more massive than this likely form from regions that supply mass via large-scale dynamical inflows within GMCs. Additionally, I will discuss the implications of observing adiabatic wind bubbles with Chandra while the massive protostars are still highly embedded., Massive protostars attain high luminosities as they are actively accreting and the radiation pressure exerted on the gas in the star's atmosphere may launch isotropic high-velocity winds. These winds will collide with the surrounding gas producing shock-heated (T ~ 10<SUP>7</SUP> K) tenuous gas that adiabatically expands and pushes on the dense gas that may otherwise be accreted. We present a suite of 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive prestellar cores and include radiative feedback from the stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, collimated outflows, and, for the first time, isotropic stellar winds to model how these processes affect the formation of massive stars. We find that winds are initially launched when the massive protostar is still accreting and its wind properties evolve as the protostar contracts to the main sequence. Wind feedback drives asymmetric adiabatic wind bubbles that have a bipolar morphology because the dense circumstellar material pinches the expansion of the hot shock-heated gas. We term this the ""wind tunnel effect."" If the core is magnetized, wind feedback is less efficient at driving adiabatic wind bubbles initially because magnetic tension delays their growth. We find that wind feedback eventually quenches accretion onto ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> protostars that form from the collapse of the isolated cores simulated here. Hence, our results suggest that ≳30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> stars likely require larger-scale dynamical inflows from their host cloud to overcome wind feedback. Additionally, we discuss the implications of observing adiabatic wind bubbles with Chandra while the massive protostars are still highly embedded., Numerous spherical ``shells"" have been observed in young star-forming environments that host low- and intermediate-mass stars. These observations suggest that these shells may be produced by isotropic stellar wind feedback from young main-sequence stars. However, the driving mechanism for these shells remains uncertain because the momentum injected by winds is too low to explain their sizes and dynamics due to their low mass-loss rates. However, these studies neglect how the wind kinetic energy is transferred to the ISM and instead assume it is instantly lost via radiation, suggesting that these shells are momentum-driven. Intermediate-mass stars have fast ($v_w \gtrsim 1000$ km/s) stellar winds and therefore the energy injected by winds should produce energy-driven adiabatic wind bubbles that are larger than momentum-driven wind bubbles. Here, we explore if energy-driven wind feedback can produce the observed shells by performing a series of 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of wind feedback from intermediate-mass and high-mass stars that are placed in a magnetized, turbulent molecular cloud. We find that, for the high-mass stars modeled, energy-driven wind feedback produces $\sim$pc scale wind bubbles in molecular clouds that agree with the observed shell sizes but winds from intermediate-mass stars can not produce similar shells because of their lower mass-loss rates and velocities. Therefore, such shells must be driven by other feedback processes inherent to low- and intermediate-mass star formation., Stellar feedback in the form of radiation pressure and magnetically driven collimated outflows may limit the maximum mass that a star can achieve and affect the star formation efficiency of massive prestellar cores. Here we present a series of 3D adaptive mesh refinement radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of initially turbulent, massive prestellar cores. Our simulations include radiative feedback from both the direct stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, and collimated outflow feedback from the accreting stars. We find that protostellar outflows punch holes in the dusty circumstellar gas along the star's polar directions, thereby increasing the size of optically thin regions through which radiation can escape. Precession of the outflows as the star's spin axis changes due to the turbulent accretion flow further broadens the outflow, and causes more material to be entrained. Additionally, the presence of magnetic fields in the entrained material leads to broader entrained outflows that escape the core. We compare the injected and entrained outflow properties and find that the entrained outflow mass is a factor of ∼3 larger than the injected mass and the momentum and energy contained in the entrained material are ∼25% and ∼5% of the injected momentum and energy, respectively. As a result, we find that, when one includes both outflows and radiation pressure, the former are a much more effective and important feedback mechanism, even for massive stars with significant radiative outputs., Star formation is a multi-scale, multi-physics problem ranging from the size scale of molecular clouds (∼10 s pc) down to the size scales of dense prestellar cores (∼0.1 pc) that are the birth sites of stars. Several physical processes like turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback, such as radiation pressure and outflows, are more or less important for different stellar masses and size scales. During the last decade a variety of technological and computing advances have transformed our understanding of star formation through the use of multi-wavelength observations, large scale observational surveys, and multi-physics multi-dimensional numerical simulations. Additionally, the use of synthetic observations of simulations have provided a useful tool to interpret observational data and evaluate the importance of various physical processes on different scales in star formation. Here, we review these recent advancements in both high- (M ≳8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and low-mass star formation., Similar to their low-mass counterparts, massive stars likely form via the collapse of prestellar molecular cores. Recent observations suggest that most massive cores are subvirial (i.e., not supported by turbulence) and therefore are likely unstable to gravitational collapse. Here we perform radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to follow the collapse of turbulent massive prestellar cores with subvirial and virialized initial conditions to explore how their dynamic state affects the formation of massive stars and core fragmentation into companion stars. We find that subvirial cores undergo rapid monolithic collapse, resulting in higher accretion rates at early times as compared to the collapse of virialized cores that have the same physical properties. In contrast, we find that virialized cores undergo a slower, gradual collapse and significant turbulent fragmentation at early times, resulting in numerous companion stars. In the absence of strong magnetic fields and protostellar outflows, we find that the faster growth rate of massive stars that are born out of subvirial cores leads to an increase in the radiative heating of the core, thereby further suppressing fragmentation at early times when turbulent fragmentation occurs for virialized cores. Regardless of initial condition, we find that the massive accretion disks that form around massive stars dominant the accretion flow onto the star at late times and eventually become gravitationally unstable and fragment to form companion stars at late times., The injection of energy and momentum into the interstellar medium by young massive stars' intense radiation fields and their fast, radiatively driven winds can have a profound influence on their formation and environment. Massive star forming regions are rare and highly obscured, making the early moments of their formation difficult to observe. Instead, we must turn to theory to elucidate the physics involved in the formation of massive stars and massive star clusters (MSCs), which can host thousands of massive stars. In my thesis, I developed analytical and numerical techniques to study the formation of massive stars and how stellar wind feedback affects the dynamics of gas that surrounds MSCs. To estimate the initial rotation rates of massive stars at birth, I developed a protostellar angular momentum evolution model for accreting protostars to determine if magnetic torques can spin down massive stars during their formation. I found that magnetic torques are insufficient to spin down massive stars due to their short formation times and high accretion rates. Radiation pressure is likely the dominate feedback mechanism regulating massive star formation. Therefore detailed simulation of the formation of massive stars requires an accurate treatment of radiation. For this purpose, I developed a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the absorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and processing by interstellar dust. With this new tool, I performed a suite of three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of massive stars from collapsing massive pre-stellar cores. I found that mass is channeled to the massive star via dense infalling filaments that are uninhibited by radiation pressure and gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. To determine the importance of stellar wind feedback in young MSCs, I used observations to constrain a range of kinetic energy loss channels for the hot gas produced by the shock- heating of stellar winds to explain the low X-ray luminosities observed in Hii regions. I demonstrated that the energy injected by stellar winds is not a significant contributor to stellar feedback in young MSCs., We present a highly-parallel multi-frequency hybrid radiation hydrodynamics algorithm that combines a spatially-adaptive long characteristics method for the radiation field from point sources with a moment method that handles the diffuse radiation field produced by a volume-filling fluid. Our Hybrid Adaptive Ray-Moment Method (HARM<SUP>2</SUP>) operates on patch-based adaptive grids, is compatible with asynchronous time stepping, and works with any moment method. In comparison to previous long characteristics methods, we have greatly improved the parallel performance of the adaptive long-characteristics method by developing a new completely asynchronous and non-blocking communication algorithm. As a result of this improvement, our implementation achieves near-perfect scaling up to O (10<SUP>3</SUP>) processors on distributed memory machines. We present a series of tests to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the method., Massive stars play an essential role in the Universe. They are rare, yet the energy and momentum they inject into the interstellar medium with their intense radiation fields dwarfs the contribution by their vastly more numerous low-mass cousins. Previous theoretical and observational studies have concluded that the feedback associated with massive stars' radiation fields is the dominant mechanism regulating massive star and massive star cluster (MSC) formation. Therefore detailed simulation of the formation of massive stars and MSCs, which host hundreds to thousands of massive stars, requires an accurate treatment of radiation. For this purpose, we have developed a new, highly accurate hybrid radiation algorithm that properly treats the absorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and processing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform a suite of three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of massive stars and MSCs. For individual massive stellar systems, we simulate the collapse of massive pre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly resolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is channeled to the massive stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities. For laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field produces later onset of RT instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided the edges of the radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. RT instabilities arise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial turbulence seeds the instabilities. To model MSC formation, we simulate the collapse of a dense, turbulent, magnetized M<SUB>cl </SUB>= 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> molecular cloud. We find that the influence of the magnetic pressure and radiative feedback slows down star formation. Furthermore, we find that star formation is suppressed along dense filaments where the magnetic field is amplified. Our results suggest that the combined effect of turbulence, magnetic pressure, and radiative feedback from massive stars is responsible for the low star formation efficiencies observed in molecular clouds., The pressure exerted by massive stars' radiation fields is an important mechanism regulating their formation. Detailed simulation of massive star formation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all published simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited validity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby suppressing potentially important instabilities; or did not provide adequate resolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this, we have developed a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the absorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and processing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive pre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly resolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is channelled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, in agreement with previous results using stars capable of moving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with simulations that do not adequately resolve the development of RT instabilities. For laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field produces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided the edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities arise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial turbulence seeds the instabilities. Our results suggest that RT features should be present around accreting massive stars throughout their formation., We present a highly-parallel multi-frequency hybrid radiation hydrodynamics algorithm that combines a spatially-adaptive long characteristics method for the radiation field from point sources with a moment method that handles the diffuse radiation field produced by a volume-filling fluid. Our Hybrid Adaptive Ray-Moment Method (HARM$^2$) operates on patch-based adaptive grids, is compatible with asynchronous time stepping, and works with any moment method. In comparison to previous long characteristics methods, we have greatly improved the parallel performance of the adaptive long-characteristics method by developing a new completely asynchronous and non-blocking communication algorithm. As a result of this improvement, our implementation achieves near-perfect scaling up to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ processors on distributed memory machines. We present a series of tests to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the method., Stellar feedback, the injection of energy and momentum by stars, remains one of the largest uncertainties in star cluster formation. Massive stars dramatically affect the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) through a variety of feedback mechanisms including the direct and dust-reprocessed radiation pressure, and the hot gas shock-heated by stellar winds. These mechanisms can limit star formation efficiencies in massive star clusters (MSCs). For stellar winds, I discuss how we can use observations to constrain a range of kinetic energy loss channels, including radiative cooling, mechanical work on the cold ISM, thermal conduction, heating of dust via collisions by the hot gas, and bulk advection of thermal energy by the hot gas. I demonstrate that the kinetic energy injected by stellar winds is not a significant contributor to stellar feedback. I argue instead that radiation pressure is likely the dominant feedback mechanism in MSCs formed in massive, dense molecular clouds with escape speeds greater than 10 km/s, at least for the ~4 Myr before supernovae begin. Thus simulations of MSC formation require an accurate treatment of the radiation field which captures the first absorption event of stellar irradiation and also follows the diffuse dust-reprocessed radiation field. To this end, we have developed a multi-frequency hybrid radiation scheme in the astrophysical AMR code ORION to be used in such simulations., The observed diffuse X-ray emission from massive star clusters (MSCs) is far weaker than predicted by theoretical models. There are several energy-loss mechanisms that can account for this but which mechanism dominates determines the importance of stellar winds as a feedback mechanism that regulates star formation. Existing observations have been unable to settle this question, so we propose to address it by performing radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation of MSCs, including radiation and stellar wind feedback, and then making mock Chandra images from our simulations that we can compare to archival and future images of 30 Doradus. This will enable us to determine the observable signatures of the various loss mechanisms and to search for such signatures in the archives., Star clusters larger than ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> contain multiple hot stars that launch fast stellar winds. The integrated kinetic energy carried by these winds is comparable to that delivered by supernova explosions, suggesting that at early times winds could be an important form of feedback on the surrounding cold material from which the star cluster formed. However, the interaction of these winds with the surrounding clumpy, turbulent, cold gas is complex and poorly understood. Here, we investigate this problem via an accounting exercise: we use empirically determined properties of four well-studied massive star clusters to determine where the energy injected by stellar winds ultimately ends up. We consider a range of kinetic energy loss channels, including radiative cooling, mechanical work on the cold interstellar medium, thermal conduction, heating of dust via collisions by the hot gas, and bulk advection of thermal energy by the hot gas. We show that, for at least some of the clusters, none of these channels can account for more than a small fraction of the injected energy. We suggest that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface or physical leakage of the hot gas from the H II region can efficiently remove the kinetic energy injected by the massive stars in young star clusters. Even for the clusters where we are able to account for all the injected kinetic energy, we show that our accounting sets strong constraints on the importance of stellar winds as a mechanism for feedback on the cold interstellar medium., Very early in its operation, the Hubble Space Telescope {HST} opened an entirely new frontier: study of the demographics and properties of star clusters far beyond the Milky Way. However, interpretation of HST's observations has proven difficult, and has led to the development of two conflicting models. One view is that most massive star clusters are disrupted during their infancy by feedback from newly formed stars {i.e., ""infant mortality""}, independent of cluster mass or environment. The other model is that most star clusters survive their infancy and are disrupted later by mass-dependent dynamical processes. Since observations at present have failed to discriminate between these views, we propose a theoretical investigation to provide new insight. We will perform radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of massive star clusters, including for the first time a realistic treatment of the most important stellar feedback processes. These simulations will elucidate the physics of stellar feedback, and allow us to determine whether cluster disruption is mass-dependent or -independent. We will also use our simulations to search for observational diagnostics that can distinguish bound from unbound clusters, and to predict how cluster disruption affects the cluster luminosity function in a variety of galactic environments., The physical mechanisms that set the initial rotation rates in massive stars are a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. It has been shown that the magnetic coupling between the star and its accretion disk is sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars to well below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rate is low. However, we find that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spin down massive PMS stars due to their short formation times and high accretion rates. To explore this issue we model the angular momentum evolution for a wide range of stellar masses by considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. We find that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low or high mass stars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spun down significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formation either. Spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes are substantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than current observations suggest., The physical mechanisms that set the initial rotation rates in massive stars are a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. Observations of young, massive stars provide evidence that they form in a similar fashion to their low-mass counterparts. The magnetic coupling between a star and its accretion disk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars to well below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rate is low. However, we show that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spin down massive PMS stars due to their short formation times and high accretion rates. We develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over a wide range in mass, considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. We find that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low-mass or high-mass stars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spun down significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formation either. Spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes are substantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than current observations suggest., When an intermediate-mass star speeds through a dense interstellar cloud at a high velocity, it can produce a cometary or bow shock structure due to the cloud being impacted by the intense stellar wind. This class of objects, recently discovered in an HST imaging survey, has been dubbed ""ballistic stellar interlopers"" (Sahai et al. 2009). Using the ARO's 12m and SMT 10m millimeter-wave dishes, we have obtained molecular line emission data towards 10 stellar interloper sources, in order to identify and characterize the dense clouds with which the interlopers are interacting. We have made small ""on-the-fly"" maps in the 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1) lines for each cloud, and obtained spectra of high-density tracers such as N2H+ (J=3-2), HCO+ (J=3-2), CN(N=2-1), and SO(J=5-4), which probe a range of physical conditions in the interstellar clouds being impacted by the interlopers. The data have been reduced and analyzed, and preliminary estimates of the cloud temperatures (9-22 K) and 13CO optical depths (0.18-0.37) have been made. The maps, which show the emission as a function of radial velocity and spatial offset from the location of the interlopers, have helped us distinguish between the clouds interacting with the interlopers, and those which are unrelated but happen to lie along the line of sight. These data will now enable us to carry out high-resolution mm-wave interferometric observations of the interlopers in the future. <P />This research was performed at JPL under the Minority Education Initiatives program.

Special thanks goes to John Bieging and Bill Peters of the Arizona Radio Observatory., Recent high resolution bispectrum speckle interferometric observations in the near-infrared have revealed that the area surrounding NGC 7538 IRS1 is associated with a fan-like region that contains several stars and regions of diffuse emission. An interpretation of the speckle, CO, and methanol maser data, which shows the current position angle of the protostar's accretion disk on the sky, is of a jet with a large precession angle. Here, we run a molecular jet simulation with a similarly wide precession angle. We analyze the simulation for properties associated with the flow and the calculated emission. We can reproduce the ``older"" average position angle for the CO emission, compared with a more recent value from molecular hydrogen (i.e., shocked gas) emission (which we use as a proxy for the K' band emission). Thus, the model is consistent with the interpretation that a precessing jet is responsible for much of the molecular emission (covering different emission lines) in the IRS1 region., We present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of jets as a model for protostellar outflows. We investigate molecular jets which are initially heavier, equal or lighter than a uniform ambient molecular medium, as well as a ballistic atomic jet, with the aim of distinguishing the resulting structures and relating them to various proposed protostellar evolutionary stages. We modify the ZEUS numerical code, to include time-dependent molecular hydrogen chemistry, a limited equilibrium C and O chemistry, and a detailed cooling function. We find highly focussed and accelerated flow patterns for outflows driven by molecular jets, caused by the combined strong cooling, small imposed jet shear and precession. We also find shoulders in the interface with associated shocks visible in our simulated near-infrared H_2 images. The shoulder location relative to the front of the bow shock distinguishes the relative density. Apart from this, the outflow structures are quite similar provided the jet is molecular. The ratio of jet power to H_2 1-0 S(1) line luminosity (increasingly required to interpret observations), is generally in the range 80-600. Sub-millimetre CO properties, including a velocity-position and velocity-channel diagram; are presented. We compare mass-velocity relationships derived directly and via the simulated CO data: significant systematic differences are uncovered. For the future, we identify fine-scale structure in the rotational CO 2-1 and CO 14-13 rotational lines which can be resolved with the millimetre array ALMA and the Herschel (FIRST) Observatory. We identify highly collimated outflows in the near-infrared that can be interpreted by this model., Molecular jets are frequently associated with the star formation process, and so examining simulated jets for molecular emission can help to answer questions related to the energy budget for the jets, the nature of the ambient medium and the evolution of the underlying source. Previously, we have simulated 3D molecular jets and examined them for the effects of the jet-to-ambient density, rapid mass flux changes, and the angle of a fast precessing jet. Here, we extend the work on precessing jets by slowing the rate of the precession to one turn in a jet axis crossing time (for our small grid, this is about 400 years). In one of the two simulations presented here, we removed the pulsation that had been present in all of our previous molecular jet simulations. We will show simulated images in some molelcular hydrogen and CO emission lines, some sample position velocity and velocity channel maps from both simulations. We also analyse the simulations for the mass-velocity and intensity-velocity relationships.

The sample of YSOs were selected using photometric information from the AllWISE catalogue. This table contains the list of the 1082 selected YSOs and their derived properties. <P />(1 data file)., The interaction between supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) continues to be an open question in galaxy evolution. In our study, we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of SMBH feedback on galactic metal retention and the motion of metals and gas into and through the CGM of L<SUB>*</SUB> galaxies. We examine 140 galaxies from the 25 Mpc cosmological volume ROMULUS25, with stellar masses between log(M <SUB>*</SUB>/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) = 9.5–11.5. We measure the fraction of metals remaining in the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM of each galaxy and calculate the expected mass of each SMBH based on the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ relation (Kormendy &amp; Ho 2013). The deviation of each SMBH from its expected mass, ΔM <SUB>BH</SUB>, is compared to the potential of its host via σ. We find that SMBHs with accreted mass above M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ are more effective at removing metals from the ISM than undermassive SMBHs in star-forming galaxies. Overall, overmassive SMBHs suppress the total star formation of their host galaxies and more effectively move metals from the ISM into the CGM. However, we see little to no evacuation of gas from the CGM out of their halos, in contrast with other simulations. Finally, we predict that C IV column densities in the CGM of L<SUB>*</SUB> galaxies are unlikely to depend on host galaxy SMBH mass. Our results show that the scatter in the low-mass end of the M <SUB>BH</SUB>–σ relation may indicate how effective an SMBH is in the local redistribution of mass in its host galaxy., In this talk, I will discuss the impact of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback on the gas phase evolution of simulated Milky Way-mass (MW-mass) galaxies. Both my simulation suites were created with the N-body+Smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa, and include a 25 Mpc cosmological volume, Romulus25, and a suite of ""genetically modified"" (GM) zoom-in galaxies. These GM galaxies originate from nearly identical initial conditions resulting in minor modifications to their accretion histories that maintain the large scale structure and final main halo mass of the original simulation. Exploring the over 140 galaxies from these combined simulation suites, we find that (1) the SMBH propagates metals from the disk out into CGM, (2) how much metal is retained in the ISM (and CGM) depends on the SMBH's deviation from the M-sigma relation, and (3) black hole accretion histories can be influenced by larger-scale galaxy accretion physics, which work in tandem to quench star formation., In this talk, I will discuss the effects of environment and supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback working together to quench a set of Milky Way-mass (MW-mass) galaxies. Specifically, we examine the cessation of star formation in Milky Way analogs from the cosmological volume, Romulus25, and a set of four zoom-in simulations run using the N-body+Smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa. These four zoom-in galaxy simulations implement a novel technique called genetic modification to generate galaxies from nearly identical initial conditions. These genetically modified (GM) galaxies are characterized by minor modifications to their accretion histories while maintaining the large scale structure and final main halo mass of the original simulation. This technique allows for a truly controlled experiment that can isolate specific physical processes that influence galaxy evolution. Exploring MW-mass galaxies from both of these simulation suites, we find that the combination of large-scale galaxy accretion-in the form of minor merger interactions-and feedback from the SMBH can work in tandem to fully quench star formation. <P />This work was supported by the FINESST19-23 Grant 80NSSC19K1409., We study the open cluster Alessi-Teutsch 9 (ASCC 10) using data from Gaia EDR3 and additional multiband photometry in 12 bands spanning the optical range from 3000 to 10000Å. We obtain a total of 55 reliable members that allow us to determine the accurate properties for this cluster. This table contains the list of members and their derived properties. <P />(1 data file)., Using the N-body+Smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa, we identify two merger-driven processes—disk disruption and supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback—which work together to quench L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxies for over 7 Gyr. Specifically, we examine the cessation of star formation in a simulated Milky Way (MW) analog, driven by an interaction with two minor satellites. Both interactions occur within ∼100 Myr of each other, and the satellites both have masses 5-20 times smaller than that of their MW-like host galaxy. Using the genetic modification process of Roth et al., we generate a set of four zoom-in, MW-mass galaxies all of which exhibit unique star formation histories due to small changes to their assembly histories. In two of these four cases, the galaxy is quenched by z = 1. Because these are controlled modifications, we are able to isolate the effects of two closely spaced minor merger events, the relative timing of which determines whether the MW-mass main galaxy quenches. This one-two punch works to: (1) fuel the SMBH at its peak accretion rate and (2) disrupt the cold, gaseous disk of the host galaxy. The end result is that feedback from the SMBH thoroughly and abruptly ends the star formation of the galaxy by z ≈ 1. We search for and find a similar quenching event in ROMULUS25, a hydrodynamical (25 Mpc)<SUP>3</SUP> volume simulation, demonstrating that the mechanism is common enough to occur even in a small sample of MW-mass quenched galaxies at z = 0., We improved a method to calculate open cluster radii from proper motion data in a reliable way. We applied it to a list of clusters using data from Gaia DR2. This table contains the obtained radii for 401 clusters. Additionally, we report the estimated number of members and the mean cluster proper motion. <P />(1 data file)., We examine the effects of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (ROMULUS25) and a set of four zoom-in “genetically modified” Milky-Way-mass galaxies sampling different evolutionary paths. By tracing the distribution of metals in the CGM, we show that O VI is a sensitive indicator of SMBH feedback. First, we calculate the column densities of O VI in simulated Milky-Way-mass galaxies and compare them with observations from the COS-Halos Survey. Our simulations show column densities of O VI in the CGM consistent with those of COS-Halos star-forming and quenched galaxies. These results contrast with those from previous simulation studies which typically underproduce CGM column densities of O VI. We determine that a galaxy’s star formation history and assembly record have little effect on the amount of O VI in its CGM. Instead, column densities of O VI are closely tied to galaxy halo mass and BH growth history. The set of zoom-in, genetically modified Milky-Way-mass galaxies indicates that the SMBH drives highly metal-enriched material out into its host galaxy’s halo, which in turn elevates the column densities of O VI in the CGM., We propose a new method for calculating the radius of an open cluster in an objective way from an astrometric catalogue containing, at least, positions and proper motions. It uses the minimum spanning tree in the proper motion space to discriminate cluster stars from field stars and it quantifies the strength of the cluster-field separation. This is done for a range of different sampling radii from where the cluster radius is obtained as the size at which the best cluster-field separation is achieved. The novelty of this strategy is that the cluster radius is obtained independently of how its stars are spatially distributed. We test the reliability and robustness of the method with both simulated and real data from a well-studied open cluster (NGC 188), and apply it to UCAC4 data for five other open clusters with different catalogued radius values. NGC 188, NGC 1647, NGC 6603, and uprecht 155 yielded unambiguous radius values. However, ASCC 19 and Collinder 471 showed more than one possible solution, but it is not possible to know whether this is due to the involved uncertainties or due to the presence of complex patterns in their proper motion distributions., By tracing the redistribution of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) via outflows, we show that OVI is a sensitive indicator of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback. We examine the effects of SMBH feedback on the CGM using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (Romulus25, Tremmel et al. 2017) and a set of zoom-in ""genetically modified"" Milky Way-mass galaxies sampling different evolutionary paths. We compare the column densities of OVI in Milky Way-mass galaxies and compare them with observations from the COS-Halos Survey; contrary to previous simulations which underpredicted the CGM column densities of OVI, these simulations are consistent with COS- Halos observations of star forming galaxies and slightly overpredict OVI in quenched galaxies. We determine that a galaxy's star formation history and overall accretion rate have little effect on the appearance of OVI in its CGM while column densities of OVI are more closely tied to galaxy halo mass and BH growth history. The set of zoom-in, genetically modified Milky Way-mass galaxies confirm that the SMBH acts as the physical mechanism for transporting metals out into its host halo thereby significantly impacting the column densities of OVI found in the CGM., Using a new, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-type (MW-type) galaxy, we explore how a merger-rich assembly history affects the mass budget of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We examine a MW-mass halo at the present epoch whose evolution is characterized by several major mergers to isolate the importance of merger history on black hole (BH) accretion. This study is an extension of Bellovary et al. (2013), which analyzed the accretion of high mass, high-redshift galaxies and their central BHs, and found that the gas content of the central BH reflects what is accreted by the host galaxy halo. In this study, we find that a merger-rich galaxy will have a central SMBH preferentially fed by gas accreted through mergers. Moreover, we find that the gas composition of the inner ∼10 kpc of the galaxy can account for the increase of merger-accreted gas fueling the SMBH. Through an investigation of the angular momentum of the gas entering the host and its SMBH, we determine that gas accreted through mergers enters the galaxy halo with lower angular momentum compared to smooth accretion, partially accounting for the preferential fueling witnessed in the SMBH. In addition, the presence of mergers, particularly major mergers, also helps funnel low angular momentum gas more readily to the center of the galaxy. Our results imply that galaxy mergers play an important role in feeding the SMBH in MW-type galaxies with merger-rich histories., With the use of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies, we identify the preferential source of gas that is accreted by the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) they host. We examine simulations of two Milky Way analogs, each distinguished by a differing merger history. One galaxy is characterized by several major mergers and the other has a more quiescent history. By examining and comparing these two galaxies, which have a similar structure at z=0, we asses the importance of merger history on black hole accretion. This study is an extension of Bellovary et. al. 2013, which studied accretion onto SMBHs in massive, high redshift galaxies. Bellovary found that the fraction of gas accreted by the galaxy was proportional to that which was accreted by its SMBH. Contrary to Bellovary's previous results, we found that though the gas accreted by a quiescent galaxy will mirror the accretion of its central SMBH, a galaxy that is characterized by an active merger history will have a SMBH that preferentially accretes gas gained through mergers. We move forward by examining the angular momentum of the gas accreted by these Milky Way-type galaxies to better understand the mechanisms fueling their central SMBH., Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-type Galaxies, we explore the effect of accreted gas as feeding mechanisms for supermassive black holes. By examining two of these galaxies with differing merger histories, one characterized by several major mergers and the other with a quiescent history, we can examine the importance of merger history on black hole accretion. This study is an extension of Bellovary et. al. 2013, which did a similar study analyzing the accretion of high mass, high redshift galaxies and their central black holes. Bellovary found that the gas accreted by the central black holes was proportional to that accreted by the host galaxy. Contrary to the previous study's results, we've found that while a galaxy with a quiescent history will still have a black hole mirroring the accretion of its host, a galaxy with an active merger history has a central black hole that is preferentially fueled by gas accreted through mergers. We look to the the angular momentum of the accreted gas in these Milky Way analogs to develop a clearer picture of the mechanisms best fueling their central SMBHs., We analize 359 ultraviolet tiles from the All Sky Survey (AIS) of the space mission GALEX covering roughly 400 square degrees towards the Orion star-forming region. There is a total of 1,555,174 ultraviolet sources that were cross-matched with the 2MASS, UCAC4 and WISE catalogs to produce a list of 290,717 reliable sources with a wide range of photometric information. Using different color selection criteria we identify 120 Young Stellar Object candidates having ultraviolet and infrared excesses, of which 85 are new. We discuss the spatial distribution, the Spectral Energy Distributions and other physical properties of these stars., Through the use of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we explore the nature of the gas that fuels supermassive black holes in Milky Way-sized galaxies. By following the gas from its origins to its accretion onto the supermassive black hole, we can focus in particular on the relative importance of cold flow gas and gas accreted through galaxy mergers. We choose present-day Milky Way analogs with very different evolutionary pathways, one with a quiescent history and one which undergoes several major mergers, to better probe the effect merger history has on black hole growth. This study is an extension of Bellovary et. al. 2013, which examined early black hole assembly within high mass galaxies and found that the initial angular momentum of the gas was more crucial than the source and state of the gas itself. We present preliminary results on fuel that preferentially grows supermassive black holes in Milky Way analogs from seeds to the present epoch., We have used the GALEX Point Source Catalog to search for YSOs covering roughly 400 square degrees toward the Orion star-forming region. We crossed all the UV sources with other catalogs: 2MASS, UCAC4, SDSS, DENIS, CMC15 and WISE. Using different color selection criteria we identified 111 YSO candidates (81 are new identifications) showing both ultraviolet and infrared excesses. Here we present all the photometric data for this candidates. <P />(2 data files)., The M17 nebula, one of our galaxy's youngest, brightest, most massive and nearby star formation regions, features a prominent HII region and expansive giant molecular cloud (GMC). The young stellar population in M17 is characterized by a massive, main cluster within the HII region and a more dispersed and extended population enclosed by a large, shell-like structure of the GMC. This two-component population raises the possibility of triggered star formation within the nebula. We have analyzed the X-ray and infrared-excess young stellar populations to assess whether the relative masses and ages of the extended and clustered populations differ and whether this can develop a clearer picture of M17's evolution., One of the alternatives to improve the coarse resolution of the passive microwave-based observations of soil moisture is the use of multisensor/multi-resolution pixel disaggregation techniques. Visible/infrared/thermal sensors are used to provide an indirect measurement of soil moisture at high resolution, and are combined with coarser estimates of soil moisture from microwave data. Within this context, a field experiment was conducted over one Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Cal/Val site in Spain (the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca, REMEDHUS) in summer 2012, including intensive field measurements and airborne observations from optical, thermal and microwave sensors. The relationships between hyperspectral features derived from both the visible and infrared spectra and soil moisture were explored, as well as their synergy with thermal and microwave observations for obtaining soil moisture maps at very high (3.5 m) spatial resolution. Results showed that integrating the hyperspectral- derived vegetation indices (specially in the red-edge and the NIR regions) is a promising way to improve the downscaling algorithms based in the link between land surface temperature, vegetation indices and soil moisture across spatial scales., M17, also known as the Omega Nebula, is a well-known region of star formation characterized by a prominent HII region, photodissociation region and extensive giant molecular cloud (GMC). We have mapped the molecular cloud region surrounding M17 in 12CO and 13CO (J = 2 → 1) emission lines with the Heinrich Hertz Telescope. The three dimensional data cubes reveal the full extended shell structure of the molecular gas associated with the HII region, concentrated between v = 15 to 25 km/s. Utilizing a catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) compiled from both Spitzer GLIMPSE and complementary near infrared data, we can see their distribution within and around the GMC. We find a concentration of YSOs in the northern rim of the molecular cloud; however, star formation is not observed in the newly mapped region farther north. We also observe unassociated structures near M17 at higher velocities, including one shell-like structure that is also characterized by a concentration of YSOs around its rim. We propose that the shell structure may have been produced by an older HII region. The blown out shells may have triggered the star formation in the isolated regions we now observe., We use fractal analysis to systematically study the clustering strength of the distribution of stars, HII regions, molecular gas, and individual giant molecular clouds in M33 over a wide range of spatial scales. We find a clear transition from a scale-free behavior at small spatial scales to a nearly uniform distribution at large scales. The transition region lies in the range ∼ 500-1000 pc and it separates the regime of small-scale turbulent motion from that of large-scale galactic dynamics. The three-dimensional fractal dimension of bright young stars and molecular gas at small spatial scales is D_{f,3D} &lt; 1.9 indicating that the interstellar medium in M33 is on average much more fragmented and irregular than the in the Milky Way., The Interstellar Medium has a fractal structure, in the sense that gas and dust distribute in a hierarchical and selfsimilar manner. Stars in new-born clusters probably follow the same fractal patterns of their parent molecular clouds. Moreover, it seems that older clusters tend to distribute their stars with radial density profiles. Thus, it is expected that clusters form with an initial fractal distribution of stars that eventually evolves toward centrally concentrated distributions. Is this really the case? This simple picture on to the origin and early evolution of star clusters and associations is very far from being clearly understood. There can be both young clusters exhibiting radial patterns and evolved clusters showing fractal structure. Additionally, the fractal structure of some open clusters is very different from that of the Interstellar Medium in the Milky Way. Here we summarize and discuss observational and numerical evidences concerning this subject., We analyze the dependence of the membership probabilities obtained from kinematical variables on the radius of the field of view around open clusters (the sampling radius, R_s). From simulated data, we show that optimal discrimination between cluster members and non-members is achieved when the sampling radius is very close to the cluster radius. At higher R_s values, more field stars tend to be erroneously assigned as cluster members. From real data of two open clusters (<ASTROBJ>NGC 2323</ASTROBJ> and NGC 2311), we infer that the number of identified cluster members always increases with increasing R_s. However, there is a threshold value R_s,opt above which the identified cluster members are severely contaminated by field stars and the effectiveness of membership determination is relatively small. This optimal sampling radius is ≃14 arcmin for <ASTROBJ>NGC 2323</ASTROBJ> and ≃13 arcmin for NGC 2311. We discuss the reasons for this behavior and the relationship between cluster radius and optimal sampling radius. We suggest that, independently of the method used to estimate membership probabilities, several tests using different sampling radius should be performed to evaluate possible biases., The interstellar medium seems to have an underlying fractal structure, which can be characterized through its fractal dimension (D_f). However, several factors may affect the determination of D_f, such as distortions due to projection, low image resolution, opacity of the cloud, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we use both simulated clouds and real molecular cloud maps to study these effects in order to estimate D_f in a reliable way. Our results indicate in a self-consistent way that the fractal dimension of the interstellar medium is in the range 2.6 ≲ D_{f} ≲ 2.8, which is significantly higher than the value D_f ≃ 2.3 usually assumed in the literature., We have compiled literature data for positions of HII regions in external galaxies. Here we present the set of HII region catalogues for a sample of 101 disk galaxies (93 spirals and 8 irregulars). For each galaxy several properties are given including the calculated fractal (correlation) dimension of the distribution of HII regions. <P />(3 data files)., We study the thermal equilibrium and stability of isobaric, spherical structures having a radiation source located at its center. The thermal conduction coefficient, external heating and cooling rates are represented as power laws of the temperature. The internal heating decreases with distance from the source r approximately as exp(-tau)/(r**2), being tau the optical depth. We find that the influence of the radiation source is important only in the central region, but its effect is enough to make the system thermally unstable above a certain threshold central temperature. This threshold temperature decreases as the internal heating efficiency increases, but, otherwise, it does not depend on the structure size. Our results suggest that a solar-like star migrating into a diffuse interstellar region may destabilize the surrounding medium., A number of questions about Mercury shall be answered by means of the Radio Science Experiments on board the BepiColombo spacecraft. Among them: the existence of completely decoupled inner core and solid surface, the rotation state of the planet, the static and dynamic gravitational field. The achievement of these science goals depends mainly on the type and accuracy of the tracking and on-board measurement techniques used. Very precise range and range-rate tracking data from the Earth will be used together with on-board accelerometer data and the observation of landmarks on the surface of Mercury. This paper presents the achievable accuracy in the knowledge of gravitational field coefficients up to degree and order 20 and the k2 Love number as a function of the measurements accuracy and the type of orbit. The determination of the rotation state, in terms of obliquity and libration motion of the planet with respect to the spin orbit resonance could be achieved by means of optical measurements and information obtained from the gravitational field. The importance of the gravitational field knowledge in order to determine the rotation state of the planet is explained and results are presented. The 3/2 resonance of the planet spin motion with respect to the orbital motion around the Sun makes the observability of the libration motion by optical measurements dependent of the orbit orientation. Results on this topic will be presented in this paper. The expected science return in terms of gravitational field and rotation state accuracy is computed by using the Gravity and Rotation State Estimation Software Tool for Solar System Bodies (GREST), a software tool developed by DEIMOS Space under ESA/ESOC contract., , A synthetic report of the advances in the study of classical and quantum string dynamics in curved backgrounds is provided, namely : the new feature of Multistring solutions; the mass spectrum of Strings in Curved backgrounds; The effect of a Cosmological Constant and of Spacial Curvature on Classical and Quantum Strings; Classical splitting of Fundamental Strings; The General String Evolution in constant Curvature Spacetimes; The Conformal Invariance Effects; Strings on plane fronted and gravitational shock waves, string falling on spacetime singularities and its spectrum. <P />New Developments in String Gravity and String Cosmology are reported: String driven cosmology and its Predictions; The primordial gravitational wave background; Non-singular string cosmologies from Exact Conformal Field Theories; Quantum Field Theory, String Temperature and the String Phase of de Sitter space-time Hawking Radiation in String Theory and the String Phase of Black Holes; New Dual Relation between Quantum Field Theory regime and String regime and the ""QFT/String Tango"" New Coherent String States and Minimal Uncertainty Principle in string theory.","['2024yCat..36880224S', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad39eb', '2024ApJ...967..100S', '2023arXiv230507672S', 'arXiv:2305.07672', '10.48550/arXiv.2305.07672', '2023AAS...24142004S', '2023APS..APRM14003S', '2022yCatp017036601S', '10.3847/1538-4357/abeb15', '2020arXiv200905581S', '2021ApJ...911..116S', 'arXiv:2009.05581', '10.48550/arXiv.2009.05581', '2020yCat..74952882S', '2018arXiv181012319S', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab3045', 'arXiv:1810.12319', '10.48550/arXiv.1810.12319', '2019ApJ...882....8S', '2019hsax.conf..433S', '2019AAS...23333406S', '2018ApJ...860...20S', '10.48550/arXiv.1610.01155', 'arXiv:1610.01155', '2016arXiv161001155S', '10.3847/1538-4357/aac015', '2016AAS...22724118S', '2015IAUGA..2258348S', '2015hsa8.conf..616S', '2015AAS...22514305S', '2014yCat..35729089S', '10.26093/cds/vizier.35720089', '2014yCat..35720089S', '2014AAS...22334501S', '2013ESASP.722E.325S', '2013AAS...22134906S', 'arXiv:1109.3104', '10.48550/arXiv.1109.3104', '2011arXiv1109.3104S', '2011hsa6.conf..333S', '2010LNEA....4....1B', '2010arXiv1011.1374S', '10.48550/arXiv.1011.1374', 'arXiv:1011.1374', '2010A&A...510A..78S', '10.48550/arXiv.0911.5693', '2009arXiv0911.5693S', '10.1051/0004-6361/200912886', 'arXiv:0911.5693', 'arXiv:0803.1389', '2008arXiv0803.1389S', '10.48550/arXiv.0803.1389', '2009RMxAC..35...76S', '2008yCat..21780001S', '10.26093/cds/vizier.21780001', '2008RMxF...54...86S', 'arXiv:0803.1407', '10.48550/arXiv.0803.1407', '2008arXiv0803.1407S', '2003EAEJA.....4214S', '2003eucm.book...19S', '2003hep.th....2228S', '2003IJMPA..18.2011S', '10.1142/S0217751X0301543X', 'arXiv:hep-th/0302228', '10.48550/arXiv.hep-th/0302228']","[('galaxy', 73), ('mass', 35), ('star', 32), ('smbh', 30), ('cluster', 30), ('gas', 29), ('merger', 27), ('black', 23), ('hole', 23), ('history', 23)]","[(('black', 'hole'), 23), (('star', 'formation'), 14), (('supermassive', 'black'), 12), (('mass', 'galaxy'), 11), (('column', 'density'), 10), (('smbh', 'feedback'), 9), (('host', 'galaxy'), 9), (('gas', 'accreted'), 9), (('hii', 'region'), 9), (('milky', 'mass'), 8)]","[(('supermassive', 'black', 'hole'), 8), (('black', 'hole', 'smbh'), 7), (('hole', 'smbh', 'feedback'), 6), (('milky', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 6), (('column', 'densities', 'vi'), 5), (('history', 'black', 'hole'), 5), (('smoothed', 'particle', 'hydrodynamics'), 4), (('mw', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 4), (('set', 'zoom', 'genetically'), 4), (('zoom', 'genetically', 'modified'), 4)]",Dirty

In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within ∼97% of the data taken with the Puerto Rico Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the data set by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by a few factors. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival data sets for projects beyond their initial conception., , Hyper-technological civilizations may be much more detectable than less technological ones, but what would their technosignatures be? Based on admissible anthropocentrism, we present an interdisciplinary framework to answer this question., An overview of the state of technosignatures research and how technosignatures relate to the future of life., FRB 20220912A is a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) that was discovered in Fall 2022 and remained highly active for several months. We report the detection of 35 FRBs from 541 h of follow-up observations of this source using the recently refurbished Allen Telescope Array, covering 1344 MHz of bandwidth primarily centred at 1572 MHz. All 35 FRBs were detected in the lower half of the band with non-detections in the upper half and covered fluences from 4-431 Jy-ms (median = 48.27 Jy-ms). We find consistency with previous repeater studies for a range of spectrotemporal features including: bursts with downward frequency drifting over time; a positive correlation between bandwidth and centre frequency; and a decrease in sub-burst duration over time. We report an apparent decrease in the centre frequency of observed bursts over the two months of the observing campaign (corresponding to a drop of 6.21 ± 0.76 MHz per d). We predict a cut-off fluence for FRB 20220912A of F<SUB>max</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>4</SUP> Jy-ms, for this source to be consistent with the all-sky rate, and find that FRB 20220912A significantly contributed to the all-sky FRB rate at a level of a few per cent for fluences of ~100 Jy-ms. Finally, we investigate characteristic time-scales and sub-burst periodicities and find (a) a median inter-subburst time-scale of 5.82 ± 1.16 ms in the multi-component bursts and (b) no evidence of strict periodicity even in the most evenly spaced multi-component burst in the sample. Our results demonstrate the importance of wideband observations of FRBs, and provide an important set of observational parameters against which to compare FRB progenitor and emission mechanism models., In this work, we describe the first radio technosignature search that preplanned observations to synchronize with exoplanets during their transits, in a survey of a dozen exoplanets in the Kepler field. Using 6hr of L-band (1.1-1.9GHz) data taken with the Breakthrough Listen (BL) bankend on the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), we performed a SETI search using the narrowband signal search code turboSETI. <P />(1 data file)., Agrowing avenue for determining the prevalence of life beyond Earth is to search for ""technosignatures"" from extraterrestrial intelligences/agents. Technosignatures require significant energy to be visible across interstellar space and thus intentional signals might be concentrated in frequency, in time, or in space, to be found in mutually obvious places. Therefore, it could be advantageous to search for technosignatures in parts of parameter space that are mutually derivable to an observer on Earth and a distant transmitter. In this work, we used the L-band (1.1-1.9 GHz) receiver on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform the first technosignature search presynchronized with exoplanet transits, covering 12 Kepler systems. We used the Breakthrough Listen turboSETI pipeline to flag narrowband hits (~3 Hz) using a maximum drift rate of ±614.4 Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a signal-to-noise threshold of 5-the pipeline returned ~3.4 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> apparently-localized features. Visual inspection by a team of citizen scientists ruled out 99.6% of them. Further analysis found two signals of interest that warrant follow up, but no technosignatures. If the signals of interest are not redetected in future work, it will imply that the 12 targets in the search are not producing transit-aligned signals from 1.1 to 1.9 GHz with transmitter powers &gt;60 times that of the former Arecibo radar. This search debuts a range of innovative technosignature techniques: citizen science vetting of potential signals of interest, a sensitivity-aware search out to extremely high drift rates, a more flexible method of analyzing on-off cadences, and an extremely low signal-to-noise threshold., The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a 42-dish radio array in Hat Creek, California, operated by the SETI Institute. For the last few years, the ATA has been undergoing a refurbishment program, and the instrument is now exiting its commissioning stage and commencing science observations with a 20-element beamformer outfitted with upgraded feeds. In this presentation, the second in a series of two talks about the ATA, I will summarize current science programs at the ATA, including radio technosignature / Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) surveys, long-term pulsar scintillation monitoring, observations of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) environment characterization, and follow-up radio counterpart observations of slow transients., We report the detection of radio bursts from the repeating source FRB 20220912A (CHIME/FRB collaboration ATel #15679) using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA)., In 2019 April, radio observations of Proxima Centauri were performed with the Ultra-Wideband Low Receiver on the Parkes Telescope. A narrowband radio search of these data revealed a technosignature signal-of-interest reported as ""blc1"" at 982.002 MHz. After the initial discovery of blc1 in the data in 2020 October, we performed a series of reobservations over the next 6 months, totaling 39 hr of on-sky time. We do not redetect blc1, or find any other signals-of-interest, within ±1 MHz of 982.002 MHz in this data set. Taken in context, this null result implies that blc1 was transient radio frequency interference, makes it less consistent with a periodic transmission, and makes it less consistent with interstellar scintillation., The aim of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is to find technologically capable life beyond Earth through their technosignatures. On 2019 April 29, the Breakthrough Listen SETI project observed Proxima Centauri with the Parkes `Murriyang' radio telescope. These data contained a narrowband signal with characteristics broadly consistent with a technosignature near 982 MHz (`blc1'). Here we present a procedure for the analysis of potential technosignatures, in the context of the ubiquity of human-generated radio interference, which we apply to blc1. Using this procedure, we find that blc1 is not an extraterrestrial technosignature, but rather an electronically drifting intermodulation product of local, time-varying interferers aligned with the observing cadence. We find dozens of instances of radio interference with similar morphologies to blc1 at frequencies harmonically related to common clock oscillators. These complex intermodulation products highlight the necessity for detailed follow-up of any signal of interest using a procedure such as the one outlined in this work., Dr. Sofia Sheikh moderated this panel about how to get involved in SETI, featuring Dr. Steve Croft, Dr. Cherry Ng, Dr. Jill Tarter, and Prof. Jason Wright., Are we alone? The study of technosignatures, physical manifestations of technology from extraterrestrial intelligences, is a rigorous astrobiological sub-discipline. The Planetary Science decadal should include searches for technosignatures alongside biosignatures in its recommendations for funding a robust astrobiology research portfolio., Nulling pulsars are pulsars whose observed flux occasionally disappears, but the mechanism behind the cessation is not well understood. Motivated by the correlation between pulse width and nulling fraction found in Sheikh &amp; MacDonald, we compile all 378 nulling pulsars to date with their pulse widths in a machine-readable table. We also include the observing frequency and time resolution of each pulse width measurement. Such a table will be useful for future studies of this population., Approximately 8 per cent of the ~2800 known pulsars exhibit 'nulling,' a temporary broad-band cessation of normal pulsar emission. Nulling behaviour can be coarsely quantified by the nulling fraction, which describes the percentage of time a given pulsar will be found in a null state. In this paper, we perform the most thorough statistical analysis thus far of the properties of 141 known nulling pulsars. We find weak, non-linear correlations between nulling fraction and pulse width, as well as nulling fraction and spin period which could be attributed to selection effects. We also further investigate a recently hypothesized gap at 40 per cent nulling fraction. While a local minimum does exist in the distribution, we cannot confirm a consistent and unique break in the distribution when we investigate with univariate and multivariate clustering methods, nor can we prove the existence of two statistically distinct populations about this minimum. Using the same methods, we find that nulling pulsars are a statistically different population from normal, radio, non-nulling pulsars, which has never been quantitatively verified. In addition, we summarize the findings of the prior nulling pulsar statistics literature, which are notoriously contradictory. This study, in context, furthers the idea that nulling fraction alone does not contain enough information to describe the behaviour of a nulling pulsar and that other parameters such as null lengths and null randomness, in addition to a better understanding of selection effects, are required to fully understand this phenomenon., A ""technosignature"" has been defined as an ""object, substance, and/or pattern whose origin specifically requires a [technological] agent,"" by analogy with biosignatures. While searches for radio technosignatures from extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) are still the most developed, recent advances in exoplanet astronomy and computation have catalyzed a new era of technosignature searches beyond the radio wavelengths. To begin, I explore this new, expanded technosignature paradigm by proposing the first non-tautological definition of a technosignature. I then provide a framework for comparing disparate search strategies - across wavelengths, sub-disciplines, and methodologies - via the Nine Axes of Merit for Technosignature Searches. I will show that radio technosignature theory must be further developed as well; previous searches for radio technosignatures had used a maximum drift rate of approximately 1 Hz/s at 1 GHz, but I find that a limit 200 times larger is necessary to account for potential acceleration from known exoplanetary systems. I perform a full narrowband radio technosignature search of the Earth Transit Zone (ETZ), an area of the sky with a favourable geometry for ETI observers of the solar system, and set new upper limits on the occurrence rate and power of radio transmitters in the ETZ. I then discuss how pulsars, as galactic radio sources with an entangled technosignature history, can help us understand more about what is ""natural"" and what is ""artificial"" in the radio sky, and statistically investigate pulsar nulling behaviour for more pulsars and parameters than in the previous literature. Finally, I investigate a radio signal-of-interest detected in observations of Proxima Centauri and use it as a case study to develop a ""checklist"" of signal verification tests that should be performed on future signals-of-interest., We report on a search for artificial narrowband signals of 20 stars within the restricted Earth Transit Zone (rETZ) as a part of the ten-year Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The rETZ is the region of the sky from which an observer would see Earth transit the Sun with an impact parameter of less than 0.5. This region of the sky is geometrically unique, providing a potential way for an ETI to discover the solar system. The targets were nearby (7-143 pc) and the search covered an electromagnetic frequency range of 3.95-8.00 GHz. We used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform these observations with the standard BL data recorder. We searched these data for artificial narrowband (∼Hz) signals with Doppler drift rates of ±20 Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We find no evidence for radio technosignatures from ETI in our observations. The observing campaign would have allowed for detections of emissions that were 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 0.88 times as powerful as the signaling capability of the Arecibo radar transmitter. We conclude that at least 0.6% of the systems in the rETZ within 150 pc do not possess the type of transmitters searched in this survey. To our knowledge, this is the first targeted search for ETI of the rETZ. All data used in this paper are publicly available via the BL Public Data Archive (http://seti.berkeley.edu/bldr2)., The diverse methodologies and myriad orthogonal proposals for the best technosignatures to search for in SETI can make it difficult to develop an effective and balanced search strategy, especially from a funding perspective. Here I propose a framework to compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of various proposed technosignatures based on nine ""axes of merit"". This framework was first developed at the NASA Technosignatures Workshop in Houston in 2018 and published in that report. I give the definition and rationale behind the nine axes as well as the history of each axis in the SETI and technosignature literature. These axes are then applied to three example classes of technosignature searches as an illustration of their use. An open-source software tool is available to allow technosignature researchers to make their own version of the figure., A radio transmitter that is accelerating with a non-zero radial component with respect to a receiver will produce a signal that appears to change its frequency over time. This effect, commonly produced in astrophysical situations where orbital and rotational motions are ubiquitous, is called a drift rate. In radio SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) research, it is unknown a priori which frequency a signal is being sent at, or even if there will be any drift rate at all besides motions within the solar system. Therefore drift rates across the potential range need to be individually searched and a maximum drift rate needs to be chosen. The middle of this range is zero, indicating no acceleration, but the absolute value for the limits remains unconstrained. A balance must be struck between computational time and the possibility of excluding a signal from an ETI. In this work, we examine physical considerations that constrain a maximum drift rate and highlight the importance of this problem in any narrowband SETI search. We determine that a normalized drift rate of 200 nHz (e.g., 200 Hz s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 1 GHz) is a generous, physically motivated guideline for the maximum drift rate that should be applied to future narrowband SETI projects if computational capabilities permit., The search for intelligent life in the universe is called SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) and is a sub-field of astrobiology. Many SETI searches are performed by using radio telescopes to search the sky for obviously artificial signals. One common problem in these searches is having to account for how a hypothetical transmitter is moving relative to the Earth – relative acceleration causes slopes called ""drift rates"" in the data, and if we fail to account for them, we'll miss the signals in our analysis. In this study, we used exoplanet and solar system characteristics and theory to put limits on how high these drift rates could be, in order to inform our search algorithms. We found that the guidelines that were previously used would accidentally throw out a signal from Jupiter's moon Io, and that, if the computational resources are available, a normalized maximum drift rate of 200 nHz should be used to make sure physically reasonable systems aren't being excluded from the search. This should provide a guideline for future searches to make sure that we aren't throwing the signal out with the noise.","['10.3847/1538-4357/ad8659', 'arXiv:2411.17857', '2024ApJ...976..225S', '2024arXiv241117857S', '10.48550/arXiv.2411.17857', '2024MNRAS.534.1949S', '10.1093/mnras/stae2184', '2024LPICo3068.2010S', '2024LPICo3068.2046S', '10.1093/mnras/stad3630', '2023arXiv231207756S', '2024MNRAS.52710425S', '10.48550/arXiv.2312.07756', 'arXiv:2312.07756', '2023yCat..51650061S', '10.48550/arXiv.2212.05137', '2022arXiv221205137S', '10.3847/1538-3881/aca907', 'arXiv:2212.05137', '2023AJ....165...61S', '2023AAS...24145102S', '2022ATel15735....1S', '10.3847/2515-5172/ac33b2', '2021RNAAS...5..248S', '2021arXiv211106350S', '10.1038/s41550-021-01508-8', 'arXiv:2111.06350', '10.48550/arXiv.2111.06350', '2021NatAs...5.1153S', '2021NatAs.tmp..206S', '2021aoo..confE..11S', '10.5281/zenodo.5156165', '2021psad.rept..427S', '10.3847/25c2cfeb.93bdfe43', '2021BAAS...53d.427S', '10.3847/2515-5172/ac053f', '2021RNAAS...5..128S', '2021arXiv210200045S', '2021MNRAS.tmp..315S', '2021MNRAS.502.4669S', '10.48550/arXiv.2102.00045', 'arXiv:2102.00045', '10.1093/mnras/stab282', '2021PhDT.........5S', 'arXiv:2002.06162', '2020arXiv200206162S', '10.48550/arXiv.2002.06162', '10.3847/1538-3881/ab9361', '2020AJ....160...29S', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.02683', '2019arXiv190802683S', '2020IJAsB..19..237S', '10.1017/S1473550419000284', 'arXiv:1908.02683', '2019arXiv191001148S', '2019ApJ...884...14S', 'arXiv:1910.01148', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.01148', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab3fa8', '2019absc.conf20219S']","[('search', 36), ('radio', 28), ('signal', 24), ('pulsar', 21), ('technosignature', 18), ('technosignatures', 17), ('rate', 17), ('time', 16), ('nulling', 16), ('data', 14)]","[(('drift', 'rate'), 14), (('extraterrestrial', 'intelligence'), 8), (('signal', 'interest'), 8), (('technosignature', 'search'), 7), (('nulling', 'pulsar'), 7), (('maximum', 'drift'), 6), (('nulling', 'fraction'), 6), (('seti', 'search'), 5), (('search', 'extraterrestrial'), 5), (('jy', 'm'), 4)]","[(('maximum', 'drift', 'rate'), 6), (('search', 'extraterrestrial', 'intelligence'), 5), (('allen', 'telescope', 'array'), 3), (('radio', 'technosignature', 'search'), 3), (('green', 'bank', 'telescope'), 3), (('pulsars', 'prior', 'literature'), 2), (('prior', 'literature', 'values'), 2), (('repeating', 'fast', 'radio'), 2), (('fluences', 'jy', 'ms'), 2), (('breakthrough', 'listen', 'bl'), 2)]",Dirty

CCAT will address a suite of science goals, from Big Bang cosmology to star formation and galaxy evolution over cosmic time. Prime-Cam, a first-generation science instrument for FYST, will deliver over ten times greater sub-mm mapping speed than current and near-term facilities for unprecedented mm and sub-mm broadband and spectroscopic measurements with kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). Mod-Cam, a single instrument module version of Prime-Cam, and a first light instrument for FYST, is now being integrated with the first 280 GHz instrument module and KID arrays for first light in 2025. We present the status of the Prime-Cam and Mod-Cam instruments along with the early science return for galaxy cluster measurements anticipated from the first year of Mod-Cam observations., Simulations of galaxy clusters that are well-matched to upcoming data sets are a key tool for addressing systematics (e.g., cluster mass inference) that limit current and future cluster-based cosmology constraints. However, most state-of-the-art simulations are too computationally intensive to produce multiple versions of relevant physics systematics. We present DeepSZSim, a lightweight framework for generating simulations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect clusters based on average thermal pressure profile models. These simulations offer a fast and flexible method for generating large datasets for testing mass inference methods like machine learning and simulation-based inference. We present these simulations and their place within the larger Deep Skies nexus of versatile, multiwavelength galaxy cluster and cosmic microwave background simulators. We discuss progress and prospects for using these SZ simulations for machine learning, including simulation-based inference of cluster mass., The CCAT-prime Project's wide-field, six-meter aperture Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) is currently under construction at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in the Chilean Atacama Desert. CCAT-prime will address a suite of science goals, from Big Bang cosmology to star formation and galaxy evolution over cosmic time. Prime-Cam, a first-generation science instrument for FYST, will deliver over ten times greater sub-mm mapping speed than current and near-term facilities for unprecedented mm and sub-mm broadband and spectroscopic measurements with kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). Mod-Cam, a first light and commissioning instrument for FYST, is now being integrated with the first 280 GHz instrument module and KID arrays for first light in 2024. Mod-Cam will be used to commission instrument modules for Prime-Cam, which can house up to seven instrument modules, each targeting unique science goals. We present the design and status of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope and the Prime-Cam and Mod-Cam instruments., Mod-Cam is a first light and commissioning instrument for the CCAT-prime project's six-meter aperture Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), currently under construction at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert. Prime-Cam, a first-generation science instrument for FYST, will deliver over ten times greater mapping speed than current and near-term facilities for unprecedented 280-850 GHz broadband and spectroscopic measurements with microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). CCAT-prime will address a suite of science goals, from Big Bang cosmology to star formation and galaxy evolution over cosmic time. Mod-Cam deployment on FYST with a 280 GHz instrument module containing MKID arrays is planned for early science observations in 2024. Mod-Cam will be used to test instrument modules for Prime-Cam, which can house up to seven instrument modules. We discuss the design and status of the 0.9 m diameter, 1.8 m long Mod-Cam receiver and 40 cm diameter 280 GHz instrument module, with cold stages at 40 K, 4 K, 1 K, and 100 mK. We also describe the instrument module's cryogenic readout designs to enable the readout of more than 10,000 MKIDs across 18 networks., Prime-Cam will be a first-generation science instrument for the CCAT Observatory's new six-meter aperture Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). The FYST is currently under construction for first light in 2023 at an exceptional 5600 m elevation site on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert. Prime-Cam on the FYST will deliver over 10 times greater mapping speed than current and near-term facilities with unprecedented 210-860 GHz broadband and spectroscopic measurements using kinetic inductance detector arrays. Prime-Cam's 1.8 meter diameter cryostat will house up to seven independent instrument modules, including broadband polarization-sensitive modules and imaging spectrometer modules equipped with Fabry-Perot interferometers. CCAT-prime will complement upcoming cosmic microwave background surveys and address a suite of science goals including Big Bang cosmology, the formation of the first galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization, star formation within the Milky Way, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of galaxy clusters, galaxy evolution over cosmic time, galactic magnetic fields, and transient astronomy. We present the science goals as well as telescope and instrument designs for Prime-Cam on the FYST., We present measurements of the average thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect from optically selected galaxy groups and clusters at high signal-to-noise (up to 12 σ ) and estimate their baryon content within a 2.1<SUP>'</SUP> radius aperture. Sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR15 catalog overlap with 3,700 sq deg of sky observed by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2008 to 2018 at 150 and 98 GHz (ACT DR5), and 2,089 sq deg of internal linear combination component-separated maps combining ACT and Planck data (ACT DR4). The corresponding optical depths τ ¯, which depend on the baryon content of the halos, are estimated using results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations assuming an active galactic nuclei feedback radiative cooling model. We estimate the mean mass of the halos in multiple luminosity bins, and compare the tSZ-based τ ¯ estimates to theoretical predictions of the baryon content for a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We do the same for τ ¯ estimates extracted from fits to pairwise baryon momentum measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) for the same dataset obtained in a companion paper. We find that the τ ¯ estimates from the tSZ measurements in this work and the kSZ measurements in the companion paper agree within 1 σ for two out of the three disjoint luminosity bins studied, while they differ by 2 - 3 σ in the highest luminosity bin. The optical depth estimates account for one-third to all of the theoretically predicted baryon content in the halos across luminosity bins. Potential systematic uncertainties are discussed. The tSZ and kSZ measurements provide a step toward empirical Compton-y ¯-τ ¯ relationships to provide new tests of cluster formation and evolution models., The Simons Observatory (SO) will be a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment with three small-aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope, which will observe from the Atacama Desert in Chile. In total, SO will field $\sim$70,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz in order to achieve the sensitivity necessary to measure or constrain numerous cosmological quantities. The SO Universal Focal Plane Modules (UFMs) each contain a 150 mm diameter TES detector array, horn or lenslet optical coupling, cold readout components, and magnetic shielding. SO will use a microwave SQUID multiplexing ($\mu$MUX) readout at an initial multiplexing factor of $\sim$1000; the cold (100 mK) readout components are packaged in a $\mu$MUX readout module, which is part of the UFM, and can also be characterized independently. The 100 mK stage TES bolometer arrays and microwave SQUIDs are sensitive to magnetic fields, and their measured response will vary with the degree to which they are magnetically shielded. We present measurements of the magnetic pickup of test microwave SQUID multiplexers as a study of various shielding configurations for the Simons Observatory. We discuss how these measurements motivated the material choice and design of the UFM magnetic shielding., We present high signal-to-noise measurements of the average thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect from optically selected groups and clusters using combined maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Releases 4 and 5 (DR4, DR5) and Planck along with sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR15. We estimate the optical depths of the halos within a 2.1 arcminute radius aperture using results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare the estimates to theoretical predictions of the baryon content for a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We do the same for optical depth estimates extracted from fits to pairwise baryon momentum measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) for the same data set obtained in a companion paper. The SZ optical depth estimates account for one third to all of the theoretically predicted baryon content in the halos across luminosity bins. The tSZ and kSZ measurements provide a step towards empirical Compton-y-optical depth relationships which will provide new tests of cluster formation and evolution models., The reference design for the next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, CMB-S4, relies on large arrays of transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers coupled to Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-based readout systems. Mapping the CMB to near cosmic variance limits will enable the search for signatures of inflation and constrain dark energy and neutrino physics. AlMn TESes provide simple film manufacturing and highly uniform arrays over large areas to meet the requirements of the CMB-S4 experiment. TES parameters such as critical temperature and normal resistance must be tuned to experiment specifications and can be varied based on geometry and steps in the fabrication process such as deposition layering, geometry, and baking time and temperature. Using four-terminal sensing, we measured T<SUB>C</SUB> and R<SUB>N</SUB> of AlMn 2000 ppm films and devices of varying thicknesses fabricated at Argonne National Laboratory to motivate device geometries and fabrication processes to tune T<SUB>C</SUB> to 150-200 mK and R<SUB>N</SUB> to ∼10 mΩ . Measurements of IV curves and time constants for the resulting devices of varying leg length were made using time-division SQUID multiplexing and determined T<SUB>C</SUB>, G, k, f<SUB>3 db</SUB>, and R<SUB>N</SUB>. We present the results of these tests along with the geometries and fabrication steps used to tune the device parameters to the desired limits., In the next decade, new ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as Simons Observatory, CCAT-prime, and CMB-S4 will increase the number of detectors observing the CMB by an order of magnitude or more, dramatically improving our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics. These projects will deploy receivers with as many as hundreds of thousands of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers coupled to superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based readout systems. It is well known that superconducting devices such as TESes and SQUIDs are sensitive to magnetic fields. However, the effects of magnetic fields on TESes are not easily predicted due to the complex behavior of the superconducting transition, which motivates direct measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of these devices. We present comparative four-lead measurements of the critical temperature versus applied magnetic field of AlMn TESes varying in geometry, doping, and leg length, including Advanced ACT and POLARBEAR-2/Simons Array bolometers. MoCu ACTPol TESes are also tested and are found to be more sensitive to magnetic fields than the AlMn devices. We present an observation of weak-link-like behavior in AlMn TESes at low critical currents. We also compare measurements of magnetic sensitivity for time division multiplexing SQUIDs and frequency division multiplexing microwave (μ MUX) rf-SQUIDs. We discuss the implications of our measurements on the magnetic shielding required for future experiments that aim to map the CMB to near-fundamental limits., CCAT-prime will be a 6-meter aperture telescope operating from sub-mm to mm wavelengths, located at 5600 meters elevation on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Its novel crossed-Dragone optical design will deliver a high throughput, wide field of view capable of illuminating much larger arrays of sub-mm and mm detectors than can existing telescopes. We present an overview of the motivation and design of Prime-Cam, a first-light instrument for CCAT-prime. Prime-Cam will house seven instrument modules in a 1.8 meter diameter cryostat, cooled by a dilution refrigerator. The optical elements will consist of silicon lenses, and the instrument modules can be individually optimized for particular science goals. The current design enables both broad- band, dual-polarization measurements and narrow-band, Fabry-Perot spectroscopic imaging using multichroic transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers operating between 190 and 450 GHz. It also includes broadband kinetic induction detectors (KIDs) operating at 860 GHz. This wide range of frequencies will allow excellent characterization and removal of galactic foregrounds, which will enable precision measurements of the sub-mm and mm sky. Prime-Cam will be used to constrain cosmology via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, map the intensity of [CII] 158 μm emission from the Epoch of Reionization, measure Cosmic Microwave Background polarization and foregrounds, and characterize the star formation history over a wide range of redshifts. More information about CCAT-prime can be found at www.ccatobservatory.org., We have made improved measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We used a map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from two seasons of observations each by ACT and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) receiver. We evaluated the mean pairwise baryon momentum associated with the positions of 50,000 bright galaxies in the BOSS DR11 Large Scale Structure catalog via 600 square degrees of overlapping sky area. The measurement of the kSZ signal arising from the large-scale motions of clusters was made by fitting data to an analytical model. The free parameter of the fit determined the optical depth to microwave photon scattering for the cluster sample. We estimated the covariance matrix of the mean pairwise momentum as a function of galaxy separation using CMB simulations, jackknife evaluation, and bootstrap estimates. The most conservative simulation-based uncertainties gave signal-to-noise estimates between 3.6 and 4.1 for various luminosity cuts. Additionally, we explored a novel approach to estimating cluster optical depths from the average thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) signal at the BOSS DR11 catalog positions. Our results were broadly consistent with those obtained from the kSZ signal. In the future, the tSZ signal may provide a valuable probe of cluster optical depths, enabling the extraction of velocities from the kSZ sourced mean pairwise momenta. New CMB maps from three seasons of ACTPol observations with multi-frequency coverage overlap with nearly four times as many DR11 sources and promise to improve statistics and systematics for SZ measurements. With these and other upcoming data, the pairwise kSZ signal is poised to become a powerful new cosmological tool, able to probe large physical scales to inform neutrino physics and test models of modified gravity and dark energy.","['2024AAS...24324705V', '2024AAS...24311104V', '2023AAS...24134601V', '2022SPIE12190E..04V', '10.1117/12.2630115', '2022arXiv220805468V', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.05468', 'arXiv:2208.05468', '2022APS..APRE16003V', '2021arXiv210108373V', '2021PhRvD.104d3503V', 'arXiv:2101.08373', '10.48550/arXiv.2101.08373', '10.1103/PhysRevD.104.043503', '10.48550/arXiv.2012.04532', '2021ITAS...3169294V', '2020arXiv201204532V', '10.1109/TASC.2021.3069294', 'arXiv:2012.04532', '2021AAS...23821104V', '2019arXiv191010199V', '2019JLTP..199..408V', '2019JLTP..tmp..370V', 'arXiv:1910.10199', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.10199', '2020JLTP..199..408V', '10.1007/s10909-019-02281-9', '10.1007/s10909-018-1920-5', '2018JLTP..193..288V', '10.48550/arXiv.1710.08456', '2017arXiv171008456V', 'arXiv:1710.08456', '2018JLTP..tmp..111V', '10.1117/12.2313868', '10.48550/arXiv.1807.00058', '2018SPIE10708E..1UV', 'arXiv:1807.00058', '2018arXiv180700058V', '2017AAS...23031004V']","[('cam', 25), ('measurement', 25), ('prime', 24), ('instrument', 24), ('module', 17), ('cluster', 16), ('telescope', 14), ('fyst', 13), ('science', 13), ('time', 13)]","[(('prime', 'cam'), 15), (('instrument', 'module'), 13), (('mod', 'cam'), 10), (('ccat', 'prime'), 9), (('optical', 'depth'), 9), (('sunyaev', 'zel'), 8), (('zel', 'dovich'), 8), (('science', 'goal'), 7), (('cosmic', 'microwave'), 7), (('microwave', 'background'), 7)]","[(('sunyaev', 'zel', 'dovich'), 8), (('cosmic', 'microwave', 'background'), 7), (('fred', 'young', 'submillimeter'), 5), (('young', 'submillimeter', 'telescope'), 5), (('meter', 'aperture', 'fred'), 4), (('aperture', 'fred', 'young'), 4), (('submillimeter', 'telescope', 'fyst'), 4), (('address', 'suite', 'science'), 4), (('suite', 'science', 'goals'), 4), (('big', 'bang', 'cosmology'), 4)]",Dirty

Given a user-defined model and a spectral line dataset, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ enables inference of the model parameters through different numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, implemented in the PyMC probabilistic programming library. The API for $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is designed to support astrophysical researchers who wish to ``fit'' arbitrary, user-defined models, such as simple spectral line profile models or complicated physical models that include a full physical treatment of radiative transfer. These models are ``cloud-based'', meaning that the spectral line data are decomposed into a series of discrete clouds with parameters defined by the user's model. Importantly, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ provides algorithms to determine the optimal number of clouds for a given model and dataset., The physical nature of the warm ionized medium (WIM) remains poorly understood despite its prevalence in the Galactic disk. Radio recombination lines (RRLs) are an extinction-free probe of the Galactic WIM. The Green Bank Telescope Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey (GDIGS) mapped RRL emission in a section of the Galactic plane and revealed a significant amount of high emission measure WIM plasma. Due to the faintness of RRL emission, however, most of the GDIGS emission is confined to the vicinity of star forming regions. We report the discovery of faint RRL emission associated with the WIM along two sightlines through the Galactic midplane: at Galactic longitudes of 20° (G20) and 45° (G45). These positions were chosen to avoid contamination from discrete star forming regions. We detect broad, faint RRL emission that is consistent with the canonically pervasive, low density, ~10,000 K WIM plasma, but we also detect one narrow feature along the G20 sightline that challenges our understanding of the WIM. Assuming that this feature is dominated by thermal broadening, we place a strong upper limit of ~4,000 K on the plasma temperature. We highlight the sensitive GBT observations that enabled this discovery, discuss the implications of this discovery on our understanding of the WIM, explore possible explanations for this cool ionized gas, and motivate the need for sensitive RRL surveys of the Galactic plane in order to constrain the range of WIM physical conditions., HI absorption spectroscopy is a commonly used method for resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity (KDA) of Galactic HII regions. Given a line-of-sight through the inner Galaxy, the presence of HI absorption against the HII region continuum background at velocities between the HII region velocity and the tangent point velocity - the maximum allowed velocity given a Galactic rotation model - suggests that the nebula is at the far kinematic distance, whereas the lack of HI absorption at these velocities suggests that the nebula is at the near kinematic distance. Historically, such KDA resolutions are determined qualitatively or via a quantitative prescription. The reliability of these KDA determinations is therefore limited by the quality (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) of the HI absorption spectra and the ability of pre-defined quantitative metrics to capture the presence of potentially faint HI absorption signals. In order to overcome these limitations, we develop two machine learning tools, a support vector machine (SVM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), to resolve the KDA of Galactic HII regions using HI absorption spectra. We train our models on both high-quality, manually labeled spectra as well as a suite of synthetic spectra. Our ML techniques outperform traditional KDA resolution techniques both in terms of accuracy as well as the ability to resolve KDAs using noisy HI absorption spectra. We apply our ML models to archival HI data toward all known Galactic HII regions, identify a population of nebulae with previously incorrect KDA resolutions, and highlight the implications for studies of Galactic structure. These ML tools will be applied to the next generation of HI surveys, such as the Galactic Australia SKA Pathfinder (GASKAP) Galactic plane survey., The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (H I) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of H I absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nançay 21 cm absorption survey, Crovisier determined the mean vertical displacement of cold H I clouds, &lt;∣z∣&gt;. We revisit that author's analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the H I absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any nonzero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ∼1.5 to ∼3 times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of H I absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nançay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio &lt;∣z∣<SUP>3</SUP>&gt;/&lt;∣z∣<SUP>2</SUP>&gt; = 97 ± 15 pc, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height σ <SUB> z </SUB> = 61 ± 9 pc, an exponential scale height λ <SUB> z </SUB> = 32 ± 5 pc, and a rectangular half-width W <SUB> z,1/2</SUB> = 129 ± 20 pc. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold H I clouds appears to remain constant between the inner Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large-scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy., Initial Release, kinematic_scaleheight uses MCMC methods to kinematically estimate the vertical distribution of clouds in the Galactic plane, including the least squares analysis of Crovisier (1978), an updated least squares analysis using a modern Galactic rotation model, and a Bayesian model sampled via MCMC as described in Wenger et al. (2024)., The three-dimensional distribution of neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way disk is a key constraint on models of Galactic spiral structure, galaxy evolution, and star formation. In particular, the vertical distributions of the different phases of hydrogen (ionized, warm neutral, cold neutral, and molecular) inform our understanding of the evolution of gas between these phases. Although the scale height of the HI emission disk has been well-characterized across the Galaxy, the vertical distribution of the cold HI component is significantly more challenging to constrain due to the sensitive absorption observations required to characterize this phase. Almost four decades ago, Crovisier (1987) pioneered a kinematic method to estimate the vertical distribution of cold HI clouds in the solar neighborhood using the latest results from the Nancay 21-cm absorption survey. This method was subsequently used in other studies to constrain the vertical distribution of neutral and molecular clouds. We have discovered an error in Crovisier's method that can lead to a factor of two inaccuracy in the inferred scale height. We will discuss the mistake and, using the original Nancay data and a corrected method based on Crovisier's technique, demonstrate the magnitude of the error in the inferred scale height of the local cold HI disk. Furthermore, we will introduce a new Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of HI absorbing clouds with fewer assumptions and better accuracy. This method will be used with the latest HI absorption data from the Galactic ASKAP HI survey of the Milky Way disk to provide an unprecedented view of the 3D distribution of the cold neutral medium in the solar neighborhood., Our sample of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) comes from the maser parallax catalog in Reid+ (2014, J/ApJ/783/130) that contains parallaxes and proper motions for 103 HMSFRs and HMSFR proxies in the Milky Way. These data stem from measurements made using the NRAO VLBA, the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) project, and the European VLBI Network (EVN). <P />Our final sample contains 72 HMSFRs and 3 red supergiants (HMSFR proxies). <P />(2 data files)., We used the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope to observe the <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J=1-0) transition at 115.27120GHz toward 78 HII regions and HII region candidates located in the first Galactic quadrant. We observed the optically thin <SUP>13</SUP>CO J=1-0 transition at 110.20132GHz in a subset of targets. Our observations were performed between 2016 February 11-16. <P />We detect 117 <SUP>12</SUP>CO spectral line components in 62 of 78 WISE HII region candidates, and 40 <SUP>13</SUP>CO components in 27 of 30 targets. <P />(3 data files)., The observing strategy and data processing procedure for the Full Catalog are similar to that of Paper I (Wenger+ 2019ApJS..240...24W). We used the ATCA C/X-band receiver and Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB) to simultaneously observe 4-8GHz radio continuum emission and 20 hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) transitions in two orthogonal linear polarizations (note that Paper I incorrectly states that circular polarizations were observed). Our observations took place between 2015 June and 2019 January with a total of 900hr of telescope time split equally between the H75 and H168 antenna configurations. We observed each field for a total of ~30 to ~90min in ~5 to ~10 minute snapshots spread over ~9 hours in hour angle. See Section 3. <P />(7 data files)., We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to simultaneously observe radio-continuum and RRL emission toward our sample of 147 Galactic HII regions. The data were acquired in the most compact (D) antenna configuration as part of two projects: the pilot survey (13A-030; 5hr) in Feb and Apr 2013, and the main survey (15B-178; 30hr) in Oct and Nov 2015. The VLA X-band receiver covers the frequency range ~8-12GHz. <P />The continuum data were measured by 16 low spectral resolution spectral windows covering 7.8-8.9GHz and 9-10GHz continuously. The radio recombination line (RRL) spectra were measured by eight high-spectral resolution (31.25kHz) spectral windows, each with 16MHz of frequency coverage. See Section 3. <P />(5 data files)., Despite decades of effort, the morphological structure of the Milky Way remains hidden behind dust extinction, small number statistics, and complicated datasets. HII regions, the volumes of ionized gas surrounding recently-formed massive stars, are a classic tracer of spiral arms in galaxies. Over the past decade, the HII Region Discovery Surveys have nearly tripled the number of known Galactic HII regions. With the new Galaxy-wide flux-limited sample of Milky Way HII regions, we are poised to revolutionize our understanding of spiral structure across the Galactic disk. Traditional methods of fitting Galactic structure models to the three-dimensional positions of these nebulae are impossible, however, since most Galactic HII regions lack accurate distance determinations. We are developing a novel machine learning approach that uses simulation based inference to fit complex models of Galactic structure to the complicated position-position-velocity HII region dataset, thereby removing the need for accurate distances. Using simulated observations, we demonstrate the efficacy of this new technique and its potential to reveal the structure of spiral arms across the Milky Way., Bug fixes, formatting improvements, and new rotation curves., Initial public release, millennium-tap-query is a simple wrapper for the Python package requests to deal with connections to the Millennium TAP Web Client. With this tool you can perform basic or advanced queries to the Millennium Simulation database and download the data products. millennium-tap-query is similar to the TAP query tool in the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO) VOtables package., Generate simulated radio recombination line observations of HII regions with various internal kinematic structure. Fit single Gaussians to each pixel of the simulated observations and generate images of the fitted Gaussian center and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth., The Southern H II Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) is a 900 hr Australia Telescope Compact Array 4-10 GHz radio continuum and radio recombination line (RRL) survey of Galactic H II regions and infrared-identified H II region candidates in the southern sky. For this data release, we reprocess all previously published SHRDS data and include an additional ∼450 hr of observations. The search for new H II regions is now complete over the range 259° &lt; ℓ &lt; 346°, ∣b∣ &lt; 4° for H II region candidates with predicted 6 GHz continuum peak brightnesses ≳30 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>. We detect radio continuum emission toward 730 targets altogether including previously known nebulae and H II region candidates. By averaging ∼18 RRL transitions, we detect RRL emission toward 206 previously known H II regions and 436 H II region candidates. Including the northern sky surveys, over the last decade the H II Region Discovery Surveys have more than doubled the number of known Galactic H II regions. The census of H II regions in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) Catalog of Galactic H II Regions is now complete for nebulae with 9 GHz continuum flux densities ≳250 mJy. We compare the RRL properties of the newly discovered SHRDS nebulae with those of all previously known H II regions. The median RRL FWHM line width of the entire WISE Catalog H II region population is 23.9 km s<SUP>-1 </SUP>and is consistent between Galactic quadrants. The observed Galactic longitude-velocity asymmetry in the population of H II regions probably reflects underlying spiral structure in the Milky Way., The present-day metallicity structure of the Galactic disk is the product of billions of years of chemodynamical evolution. We use the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to measure 8-10 GHz radio continuum and hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) emission toward 82 Galactic HII regions. Since collisionally excited lines from metals (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) are the primary cooling mechanism in ionized gas, the HII region electron temperature is empirically correlated to the nebular metallicity. We use the RRL-to-continuum ratio to derive electron temperatures and infer metallicities of these Galactic HII regions. Including previous single dish studies, there are now 167 nebulae with radio-determined electron temperatures and either parallax or kinematic distance determinations. The HII region oxygen abundance gradient across the Milky Way disk has a slope of -0.052 ± 0.004 dex/kpc. We find significant azimuthal structure in the metallicity distribution. The slope of the oxygen abundance gradient varies by a factor of ~2 between Galactocentric azimuths of 30 degrees and 100 degrees. Such azimuthal structure is consistent with simulations of Galactic chemodynamical evolution influenced by spiral arms., The metallicity structure of the Milky Way disk stems from the chemodynamical evolutionary history of the Galaxy. We use the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe ∼8-10 GHz hydrogen radio recombination line and radio-continuum emission toward 82 Galactic H II regions. We use these data to derive the electron temperatures and metallicities for these nebulae. Since collisionally excited lines from metals (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) are the dominant cooling mechanism in H II regions, the nebular metallicity can be inferred from the electron temperature. Including previous single-dish studies, there are now 167 nebulae with radio-determined electron temperature and either parallax or kinematic distance determinations. The interferometric electron temperatures are systematically 10% larger than those found in previous single-dish studies, likely due to incorrect data analysis strategies, optical depth effects, and/or the observation of different gas by the interferometer. By combining the interferometer and single-dish samples, we find an oxygen abundance gradient across the Milky Way disk with a slope of -0.052 ± 0.004 dex kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also find significant azimuthal structure in the metallicity distribution. The slope of the oxygen gradient varies by a factor of ∼2 when Galactocentric azimuths near ∼30° are compared with those near ∼100°. This azimuthal structure is consistent with simulations of Galactic chemodynamical evolution influenced by spiral arms., The structure of the Milky Way is a constraint on theories of Galactic formation and evolution. HII regions, the zones of ionized gas surrounding recently formed high-mass stars, are important tracers of structure in both the Milky Way and other galaxies. Using the most complete sample of these Galactic high-mass star forming regions (HMSFRs) to date, we investigate the morphological and chemical structures in the Milky Way disk. <P />Mapping Galactic structure with HMSFRs requires accurate distances to these tracers. Unfortunately, only kinematic distances are available for most of the HMSFRs in the Galaxy. We develop a novel Monte Carlo kinematic distance method and compare the kinematic distances and parallax distances of 75 Galactic HMSFRs. The Monte Carlo method gives more accurate kinematic distances than those derived using traditional methods. The median difference between the Monte Carlo kinematic distances and parallax distances is 17% (0.42 kpc). We find that, for a large portion of the Galaxy, the kinematic distance uncertainty is up to 10 times smaller than the parallax distance uncertainty. <P />The census of Galactic HII regions is vastly incomplete in the southern sky. The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) is completing this census by identifying new HII regions from their radio recombination line (RRL) emission. We use the Australia Telescope Compact Array to measure 4-10 GHz radio continuum and hydrogen RRL emission from HII region candidate targets. Thus far, the SHRDS has discovered 295 heretofore unknown Galactic HII regions. This increases the number of known nebulae in the surveyed zone by 82% to 568. Upon the completion of the SHRDS, we will have a catalog of all Galactic HII regions ionized by at least one O-type star. <P />The metallicity structure of the Milky Way disk stems from the chemodynamical evolutionary history of the Galaxy. We use the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to measure the RRL-to-continuum brightness ratios of 82 Galactic HII regions. We then derive the electron temperatures and metallicities for these nebulae. Since collisionally excited lines from metals (e.g., oxygen) are the dominant cooling mechanism in HII regions, the nebular metallicity can be inferred from the electron temperature. Including previous single dish studies, there are now 167 nebulae with accurate electron temperature and distance determinations. We find an oxygen abundance gradient across the Milky Way disk with a slope of +0.004 +0.052/-0.003 dex/kpc. We also find azimuthal structure in the metallicity distribution. The slope of the gradient varies by a factor of ~2 with Galactocentric azimuth. This azimuthal structure is consistent with simulations of Galactic chemodynamical evolution influenced by spiral arms. <P />Finally, we explore the spiral structure of the Milky Way by constructing a simple morphological model and using it to constrain the spiral structure of the Galaxy. The model posits the neutral gas, molecular gas, and HMSFR distributions and includes parametrizations of the kinematics of the Galactic disk, the morphology of the spiral arms, and the warp of the Galactic plane. We compare the modeled emission with observations in a novel way. We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the optimal model parameters that reproduce the observed Galactic longitude, latitude, and velocity distributions of HI 21 cm hyperfine emission, 12CO (J=1-0) emission, and the number of HII regions. This is an ongoing study. Our analysis is able to recover the correct model parameters for simulated datasets, but it fails to reproduce the observed gas and HMSFR distributions. We identify degeneracies between parameters as the likely cause and assess the future capabilities of our model., The census of Galactic H II regions is vastly incomplete in the southern sky. We use the Australia Telescope Compact Array to observe 4-10 {GHz} radio continuum and hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) emission from candidate H II regions in the Galactic zone 259^\circ &lt; {\ell }&lt; 344^\circ ,| b| &lt; 4^\circ . In this first data release, we target the brightest H II region candidates and observe 282 fields in the direction of at least one previously known or candidate H II region. We detect radio continuum emission and RRL emission in 275 (97.5%) and 258 (91.5%) of these fields, respectively. We catalog the ∼7 GHz radio continuum peak flux densities and positions of 80 previously known and 298 candidate H II regions. After averaging ∼18 RRL transitions, we detect 77 RRL velocity components toward 76 previously known H II regions and 267 RRL velocity components toward 256 H II region candidates. The discovery of RRL emission from these nebulae increases the number of known Galactic H II regions in the surveyed zone by 82% to 568 nebulae. In the fourth quadrant, we discover 50 RRLs with positive velocities, placing those sources outside the solar circle. Including the pilot survey, the Southern H ɪɪ Region Discovery Survey has now discovered 295 Galactic H II regions. In the next data release, we expect to add ∼200 fainter and more distant nebulae., The morphological and chemical structure of the Galaxy is an important constraint on models of Galactic formation and evolution. HII regions, the zones of ionized gas surrounding recently formed high-mass stars, are the classic tracers of Galactic structure. The census of Galactic HII regions in the Southern sky is vastly incomplete due to a lack of sensitive radio recombination line (RRL) surveys. The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) is a 900-hour Australia Telescope Compact Array cm-wavelength RRL and continuum emission survey of hundreds of third and fourth quadrant Galactic HII region candidates. The first SHRDS data release, the Bright Catalog, increases the number of known Galactic HII regions in the surveyed zone by 82%, to 568 nebulae. In the fourth quadrant we discover 50 RRLs with positive velocities, placing those sources outside the Solar circle. Nearly all of these lie along the Galactic longitude-velocity locus of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, suggesting that this feature is a major spiral arm. I will discuss the SHRDS observing strategy, preliminary results from the first data release, and the scientific goals we will accomplish with the complete SHRDS catalog., WISP (Wenger Interferometry Software Package) is a radio interferometry calibration, reduction, imaging, and analysis package. WISP is a collection of Python code implemented through CASA (ascl:1107.013). Its generic and modular framework is designed to handle any continuum or spectral line radio interferometry data., MillCgs clusters galaxies from the semi-analytic models run on top of the Millennium Simulation to identify Compact Groups. MillCgs uses a machine learning clustering algorithm to find the groups and then runs analytics to filter out the groups that do not fit the user specified criteria. The package downloads the data, processes it, and then creates graphs of the data., The morphological and chemical structure of the Milky Way today is an important constraint on models of the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. We use H ii regions, the sites of recent massive star formation, to probe both the Galactic spiral structure and the Galactic metallicity structure. H ii regions are the brightest objects in the Galaxy at radio wavelengths and are detected across the entire Galactic disk. We derive the distances to H ii regions using parallax measurements or by deriving kinematic distances. Here we summarize ongoing work to assess the accuracy of kinematic distances and to complete the census of Galactic H ii regions in the Southern sky., Distances to high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) in the Milky Way are a crucial constraint on the structure of the Galaxy. Only kinematic distances are available for a majority of the HMSFRs in the Milky Way. Here, we compare the kinematic and parallax distances of 75 Galactic HMSFRs to assess the accuracy of kinematic distances. We derive the kinematic distances using three different methods: the traditional method using the Brand &amp; Blitz rotation curve (Method A), the traditional method using the Reid et al. rotation curve and updated solar motion parameters (Method B), and a Monte Carlo technique (Method C). Methods B and C produce kinematic distances closest to the parallax distances, with median differences of 13% (0.43 {kpc}) and 17% (0.42 {kpc}), respectively. Except in the vicinity of the tangent point, the kinematic distance uncertainties derived by Method C are smaller than those of Methods A and B. In a large region of the Galaxy, the Method C kinematic distances constrain both the distances and the Galactocentric positions of HMSFRs more accurately than parallax distances. Beyond the tangent point along ℓ = 30°, for example, the Method C kinematic distance uncertainties reach a minimum of 10% of the parallax distance uncertainty at a distance of 14 {kpc}. We develop a prescription for deriving and applying the Method C kinematic distances and distance uncertainties. The code to generate the Method C kinematic distances is publicly available and may be utilized through an online tool., HII regions, the zones of ionized gas surrounding recently formed high-mass stars, are the archetypical tracers of Galactic structure. The census of Galactic HII regions in the Southern sky is vastly incomplete due to a lack of sensitive radio recombination line (RRL) surveys. The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) is a 900-hour Australia Telescope Compact Array cm-wavelength RRL and continuum emission survey of hundreds of third and fourth quadrant Galactic HII region candidates. These candidates are identified in the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) Catalog of Galactic HII Regions based on coincident 10 micron (WISE) and 20 cm (Southern Galactic Plane Survey) emission. The SHRDS is an extension of HII Region Discovery Surveys in the Northern sky with the Green Bank Telescope and Arecibo Telescope which discovered ~800 new HII regions. In the first 500 hours of the SHRDS, we targeted the 249 brightest HII region candidates and 33 previously known HII regions. We discuss the data reduction, analysis, and preliminary results from this first stage of the survey., The Outer Scutum-Centaurus arm (OSC) is the most distant molecular spiral arm known in the Milky Way. The OSC may be the very distant end of the well-known Scutum-Centaurus arm, which stretches from the end of the Galactic bar to the outer Galaxy. At this distance the OSC is seen in the first Galactic quadrant. The population of star formation tracers in the OSC remains largely uncharacterized. Extragalactic studies show a strong correlation between molecular gas and star formation, and carbon monoxide (CO) emission was recently discovered in the OSC. Here we use the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 {{m}} telescope to observe the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 1-0 and <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 1-0 transitions toward 78 H II region candidates chosen from the WISE Catalog of Galactic H II Regions. These targets are spatially coincident with the Galactic longitude-latitude ({\ell },b) OSC locus as defined by H I emission. We detect CO emission in ∼80% of our targets. In total, we detect 117 <SUP>12</SUP>CO and 40 <SUP>13</SUP>CO emission lines. About two-thirds of our targets have at least one emission line originating beyond the solar orbit. Most of the detections beyond the solar orbit are associated with the outer arm, but there are 17 <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission lines and 8 <SUP>13</SUP>CO emission lines with LSR velocities that are consistent with the velocities of the OSC. There is no apparent difference between the physical properties (e.g., molecular column density) of these OSC molecular clouds and non-OSC molecular clouds within our sample., The Kinematic Distance utilities (KDUtils) calculate kinematic distances and kinematic distance uncertainties. The package includes methods to calculate ""traditional"" kinematic distances as well as a Monte Carlo method to calculate kinematic distances and uncertainties., HII Region Models fits HII region models to observed radio recombination line and radio continuum data. The algorithm includes the calculations of departure coefficients to correct for non-LTE effects. HII Region Models has been used to model star formation in the nucleus of IC 342., Elemental abundances are an important constraint on theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. We use HII regions as a probe of the Milky Way's metallicity structure. HII regions are the brightest objects in the Galaxy at radio wavelengths and are detected across the entire Galactic disk. In thermal equilibrium, metal abundances are expected to set the nebular electron temperature with high abundances producing low temperatures. We derive the metallicity of HII regions using an empirical relation between an HII region's radio recombination line-to-continuum ratio and nebular metallicity. Our previous studies have revealed azimuthal metallicity structure in the Galactic disk, indicating that the disk may not be as well mixed as expected. To extend this work, we obtained high quality radio recombination line and radio continuum measurements of 120 HII regions across the Galactic disk using the Jansky Very Large Array. Here we describe the observations, data reduction pipeline, and preliminary results from this study., HII regions are zones of ionized gas surrounding recently formed high-mass (OB-type) stars. They are among the brightest objects in the sky at radio wavelengths. HII regions provide a useful tool in constraining the Galactic morphological structure, chemical structure, and star formation rate. We describe the Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS), an Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) survey that discovered ~80 new HII regions (so far) in the Galactic longitude range 230 degrees to 360 degrees. This project is an extension of the Green Bank Telescope HII Region Discovery Survey (GBT HRDS), Arecibo HRDS, and GBT Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) HRDS, which together discovered ~800 new HII regions in the Galactic longitude range -20 degrees to 270 degrees. Similar to those surveys, candidate HII regions were chosen from 20 micron emission (from WISE) coincident with 10 micron (WISE) and 20 cm (SGPS) emission. By using the ATCA to detect radio continuum and radio recombination line emission from a subset of these candidates, we have added to the population of known Galactic HII regions., The Green Bank Telescope H II Region Discovery Survey (GBT HRDS) found hundreds of previously unknown Galactic regions of massive star formation by detecting hydrogen radio recombination line (RRL) emission from candidate H II region targets. Since the HRDS nebulae lie at large distances from the Sun, they are located in previously unprobed zones of the Galactic disk. Here, we derive the properties of helium and carbon RRL emission from HRDS nebulae. Our target sample is the subset of the HRDS that has visible helium or carbon RRLs. This criterion gives a total of 84 velocity components (14% of the HRDS) with helium emission and 52 (9%) with carbon emission. For our highest quality sources, the average <SUP>4</SUP>He<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio by number, langy <SUP>+</SUP>rang, is 0.068 ± 0.023(1σ). This is the same ratio as that measured for the sample of previously known Galactic H II regions. Nebulae without detected helium emission give robust y <SUP>+</SUP> upper limits. There are 5 RRL emission components with y <SUP>+</SUP> less than 0.04 and another 12 with upper limits below this value. These H II regions must have either a very low <SUP>4</SUP>He abundance or contain a significant amount ","['arXiv:2411.00924', '10.48550/arXiv.2411.00924', '2024arXiv241100924W', '2024JOSS....9.7201W', '10.21105/joss.07201', '2024AAS...24421103W', '2024AAS...24411503W', '2024ApJ...966..206W', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad3923', '2024arXiv240318981W', 'arXiv:2403.18981', '10.48550/arXiv.2403.18981', '2024zndo..10818724W', '10.5281/zenodo.10818724', '2024ascl.soft03003W', 'ascl:2403.003', '2024AAS...24315607W', '2023yCat..18560052W', '2023yCat..18520002W', '2023yCat..22540036W', '10.26093/cds/vizier.22540036', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18870114', '2023yCat..18870114W', '2023AAS...24134006W', '2021zndo...5660905W', '10.5281/zenodo.5660905', '2021zndo...5205092W', '10.5281/zenodo.5205092', 'ascl:2108.005', '2021ascl.soft08005W', 'ascl:2108.001', '2021ascl.soft08001W', '2021arXiv210312199W', '10.3847/1538-4365/abf4d4', '10.48550/arXiv.2103.12199', 'arXiv:2103.12199', '2021ApJS..254...36W', '2020AAS...23530903W', '2019ApJ...887..114W', '2019arXiv191014605W', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.14605', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab53d3', 'arXiv:1910.14605', '2019PhDT.......103W', '10.18130/v3-q99a-8112', '2019PhDT........92W', '2019ApJS..240...24W', '10.3847/1538-4365/aaf8ba', '2018arXiv181205003W', 'arXiv:1812.05003', '10.48550/arXiv.1812.05003', '2019AAS...23331102W', '2018ascl.soft12001W', 'ascl:1812.001', '2018ascl.soft11010W', 'ascl:1811.010', '10.1017/S1743921317007578', '2018IAUS..334..381W', '10.48550/arXiv.1802.04203', '2018ApJ...856...52W', '2018arXiv180204203W', 'arXiv:1802.04203', '10.3847/1538-4357/aaaec8', '2018AAS...23124725W', 'arXiv:1711.06235', '2018ApJ...852....2W', '10.48550/arXiv.1711.06235', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa9bdb', '2017arXiv171106235W', '2017ascl.soft12001W', 'ascl:1712.001', 'ascl:1707.001', '2017ascl.soft07001W', '2017AAS...22934007W', '2016AAS...22734710W', '10.1088/0004-637X/764/1/34', '10.48550/arXiv.1212.2161', '2012arXiv1212.2161W', 'arXiv:1212.2161', '2013ApJ...764...34W', '2013AAS...22141302W', '2012AAS...21914509W']","[('region', 109), ('galactic', 86), ('hii', 60), ('emission', 51), ('distance', 48), ('radio', 44), ('ii', 40), ('survey', 39), ('rrl', 38), ('structure', 36)]","[(('hii', 'region'), 60), (('ii', 'region'), 40), (('kinematic', 'distance'), 27), (('rrl', 'emission'), 20), (('galactic', 'hii'), 19), (('radio', 'recombination'), 17), (('recombination', 'line'), 17), (('region', 'candidate'), 13), (('radio', 'continuum'), 13), (('region', 'discovery'), 12)]","[(('galactic', 'hii', 'regions'), 17), (('radio', 'recombination', 'line'), 16), (('galactic', 'ii', 'regions'), 11), (('recombination', 'line', 'rrl'), 10), (('region', 'discovery', 'survey'), 9), (('hii', 'region', 'discovery'), 7), (('ii', 'region', 'candidates'), 7), (('ghz', 'radio', 'continuum'), 6), (('hydrogen', 'radio', 'recombination'), 6), (('australia', 'telescope', 'compact'), 6)]",Dirty

The high altitude (&gt;15,000 ft) and extremely dry climate make this particular region of the world uniquely well-suited to astronomical observations. However, the growing ubiquity of constellations of commercial telecommunications satellites in low-Earth orbits threatens this rare environment with potentially far-reaching impacts on science. Radio uplink and downlink communications between satellites and ground stations may interfere with the telescopes observing from this region. Llano de Chajnantor (and the surrounding area) has been designated as the Chajnantor Science Reserve by the government of Chile, but that does not provide protection from interference due to satellites. I will discuss proposals to protect this region via Radio Quiet Zone (RQZ) designations. The astronomy community must take urgent action to protect this unique and irreplaceable environment to ensure the future of our field., The anticipated ubiquity of privately owned and operated satellite spacecraft in low-Earth orbits will revolutionize the space domain. Space is becoming increasingly commercialized with satellite technology promising technological advancements such as low-cost global internet access. While satellite constellations will likely boost the global economy and increase internet accessibility worldwide, they will also introduce foreground contamination which may greatly impede astronomical observations from the ground. This proceedings discusses the projected impact of the growing space industry on the field of astronomy. Optical, radio and microwave astronomy will be affected by commercial satellite constellations. While the prognosis for ground-based astronomy may be bleak, the expected upcoming prevalence of low-cost satellite technology may open new doors for astronomers within the next decade and beyond., The imminent commercialization of satellite technology will inevitably lead to the ubiquity of privately owned and operated satellite spacecraft in low-Earth orbits. These satellites will be used for data collection for a variety of commercially viable applications including low-cost global internet access, time-share for academic researchers in fields such as astronomy and climate change, as well as access for government agencies for various applications. Satellite prevalence has natural implications for national and international security; namely, the US government could readily access global surveillance and remote sensing capabilities for a variety of military operations including weather monitoring, communications, the Department of Defense Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) enterprise, command and control for nuclear deterrence, and to track foreign entities such as terrorist cells. Thus, control and access to satellite data will bring with it great economic and military power. I will discuss frameworks for management of data access and control, focusing on the national security implications of the geopolitical landscape governing satellite spacecraft and the global commons of outer space. Topics include data control and access, cybersecurity, regulatory institutions, and the militarization of space., A promising avenue for studying the origin and evolution of the universe is to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the thermal radiation remaining from the Big Bang after billions of years of expansion. Today, this remnant takes the form of an extraordinarily uniform thermal blackbody of ∼2.7 K in temperature. Increasingly precise measurements of small fluctuations in CMB temperature and polarization have been instrumental in shaping modern understanding of the evolution of the early universe.The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new CMB experiment that will consist of several high-sensitivity polarization sensitive telescopes at ∼5200 m altitude in the Atacama Desert, Chile, observing in frequency bands between 27 GHz and 280 GHz. SO is designed to measure the temperature and polarization of the CMB to constrain cosmological parameters and detect evidence of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB polarization map. To accomplish these ambitious goals, the Simons Observatory must be built to provide unprecedented sensitivity, which requires cutting-edge, high-yield detector and readout technologies. The telescope focal planes are close-packed with Universal Focal Plane Modules (UFMs) at the 100 mK stage. UFMs are mechanically interchangeable assemblies containing stacks of 150-mm silicon wafers with detectors, optical coupling components, and readout components for microwave multiplexing (μMUX). SO will deploy a total of 49 UFMs with over 60,000 bolometers to achieve a multiplexing factor of approximately 1,000.This thesis presents my contributions to the early prototype UFM development, including the completion of sensitivity calculations used to inform design choices, the carrying out of assembly steps to maximize detector readout performance, the cryogenic testing of prototype components, and the development of a novel mathematical algorithm and device for simultaneous short checking for UFM electrical validation., Precise CMB polarization measurements are crucial in investigating dark energy. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) in Chile is built to simultaneously measure temperature and polarization. Polarization angle measurements require an error margin &lt; 0.1°, or these will limit our results. This requires greater understanding of how refractive optics alter the polarization of the microwave radiation. Lens coatings are necessary to avoid the reflection of the majority of the incoming light. Early experiments found that there were systematic angular distortions in the data, in which the optical elements in the ACTPol telescope rotated the polarization of the incoming microwave radiation slightly. We modeled a single lens using two commercial optics modeling software packages, CodeV and Zemax, with single and double-layer coatings. Unexpectedly, significant disparities between these models were observed. We subsequently developed our own Python model of the single lens system in order to predict the polarization rotation values. I will present the results of this work. Our next aim is to reproduce the modeled phenomena using physical lenses.","['2023AAS...24136503B', '10.1117/12.2630716', '2022SPIE12187E..0ZB', '2021AAS...23732705B', '2021PhDT........33B', '2015APS..APR.D1057B']","[('satellite', 14), ('polarization', 10), ('access', 7), ('telescope', 6), ('low', 6), ('cmb', 6), ('astronomy', 5), ('space', 5), ('global', 5), ('microwave', 5)]","[(('low', 'earth'), 3), (('earth', 'orbit'), 3), (('satellite', 'spacecraft'), 3), (('satellite', 'technology'), 3), (('low', 'cost'), 3), (('temperature', 'polarization'), 3), (('atacama', 'desert'), 2), (('telescope', 'observing'), 2), (('astronomical', 'observation'), 2), (('ubiquity', 'privately'), 2)]","[(('low', 'earth', 'orbits'), 3), (('ubiquity', 'privately', 'owned'), 2), (('privately', 'owned', 'operated'), 2), (('owned', 'operated', 'satellite'), 2), (('operated', 'satellite', 'spacecraft'), 2), (('satellite', 'spacecraft', 'low'), 2), (('spacecraft', 'low', 'earth'), 2), (('low', 'cost', 'global'), 2), (('cost', 'global', 'internet'), 2), (('global', 'internet', 'access'), 2)]",Dirty

Our results associate a giant planet instability in our Solar System with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk., Episodes of widespread asteroid bombardment in the solar system are thought to have been excited by giant planet migration. While recent work constrains giant planet migrations to the first ~100 Myr of solar system history, the precise timing remains unresolved. Temperature-sensitive mineral systems of meteorites record the thermal imprint of energetic impact events, which we aim to use to constrain the timescales of giant planet migration and widespread excitement in the asteroid belt (on timescales &gt;4 Gyr ago). We present a simple asteroid-scale code that simulates conductive cooling of a radiogenically heated spherical body through closure of the thermochronologic <SUP>40</SUP>K-<SUP>40</SUP>Ar system and resetting of near-surface cooling ages by decaying impactor fluxes. The thermal code is coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion that stochastically varies model parameters and calculates the likelihood that the model age distribution is drawn from the distribution of cooling ages in a database of chondrite K-Ar and Ar-Ar ages. <P />When we do not incorporate impact resetting of cooling ages, our simulations fail to converge on the observed distribution of cooling ages in chondrites. We therefore model two impact fluxes - a primordial flux anchored to the solar age (4.567 Gyr ago) and a ""post-accretion"" flux that is a free parameter explored by the model. We find that the post-accretion flux begins at a median age of ~60 Myr after the formation of the Sun.

Previous work suggested that the location of 'dark-gaps', or regions of a galaxy where the difference between the surface brightness along the bar major axis and along the bar minor axis are maximal, can be attributed to the location of bar corotation. Here, using GALAKOS, a high-resolution N-body simulation of a barred galaxy, we test this photometric method's ability to identify the bar corotation resonance. Contrary to previous work, our results indicate that 'dark-gaps' are a clear sign of the location of the 4:1 ultra-harmonic resonance instead of bar corotation. Measurements of the bar corotation can indirectly be inferred using kinematic information, e.g., by measuring the shape of the rotation curve. We demonstrate our concept on a sample of 578 face-on barred galaxies with both imaging and integral field observations and find that the sample likely consists of primarily fast bars., Observations with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) reveal Hα and [NII] emission at high velocities associated the biconical gamma-ray and X-ray lobes known as the Fermi Bubbles. We find optical-line components near the same velocities as many ultraviolet absorption line features previously detected in a quasar sightline (PDS 456) that passes through the northern Bubble near l = 10.4, b = +11.2. Combined with the recent discovery of optical line emission at high velocities associated with the bar of the Galaxy (the Tilted Disk), these data can constrain the physical conditions of the ionized ISM in the Galactic Center environment as influenced by the bar and by large scale feedback effects of the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. Variations in the [NII]/H-Alpha line ratio from the Tilted Disk show evidence of a changing interstellar radiation field that can further be tested using emission lines at velocities consistent with the Fermi Bubbles. Continued observations with WHAM will allow for these high velocity emission features to be spectroscopically mapped, as opposed to requiring sparse, bright background sources when using absorption line spectra., Gas interior to the bar of the Milky Way has recently been discovered with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) to be the closest example of a Low Ionization (Nuclear) Emission Region — LI(N)ER — in the universe. To better understand the nature of this gas, a sample of face-on galaxies with integral field spectroscopy are used to study the ionized gas conditions of barred and nonbarred galaxies, focusing on those that are most similar to the Milky Way. Strong optical line emission of [NII] λ6584, Hα λ6563 [OIII] λ5007, and Hβ λ4863 are used to diagnose the dominant ionization mechanisms of gas across extragalactic systems and the Galaxy via Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) Diagrams. Barred galaxies show strong suppression of star formation and an increase in composite and LI(N)ER like spectra in their inner regions when compared with similar nonbarred counterparts.

There is still appreciable dust extinction toward these clusters into the NIR. We measure the stellar masses of the star cluster candidates, assuming ages of 0 and 8 Myr. The slope of the resulting cluster mass function is β = 1.9 ± 0.2, in excellent agreement with studies of star clusters in other galaxies., This paper presents an overview of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case for the \textit{Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies} (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions, thanks to its cold ($&lt;$40~K) 14-m primary mirror. Key Milky Way and nearby galaxies science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of star formation in feedback in the Local Universe. In addition to this science case, SALTUS would open a new window to to of Galactic and extragalactic communities in the 2030s, enable fundamentally new questions to be answered, and be a far-IR analog to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. This paper summarizes the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case and plans for notional observing programs in both guaranteed and guest (open) time., In their earliest evolutionary stages, star clusters are obscured by their dusty natal gas clouds. However, many of their properties, such as the star formation efficiency, are set during this early phase before feedback disperses the gas. While the Hubble Space Telescope has been revolutionary to study more evolved clusters in the local Universe, longer wavelengths are required to probe the youngest (age ≲ 5 Myr) star clusters. JWST offers a new window to study these earliest phases of young massive star cluster evolution at high spatial resolution. M82 is the prototypical starburst galaxy in the local Universe. Located at a distance of 3.6 Mpc, it is an ideal laboratory in which to study the starburst lifecycle, from the young embedded star clusters to its supernova feedback-driven multiphase superwind. We present new images obtained with NIRCam onboard JWST of the central kiloparsec of M82. These images reveal the massive star clusters and the base of the superwind in stunning detail. We identify ~100 clusters with stellar masses &gt; 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radii ~1 pc. We estimate stellar masses for these clusters and investigate the cluster mass function. Upcoming observations of this region with MIRI imaging and spectroscopy will further illuminate the properties of these dusty, dynamic star clusters, their environment, and their relation to the superwind., M82 is an archetypal starburst galaxy in the local Universe. The central burst of star formation, thought to be triggered by M82's interaction with other members in the M81 group, is driving a multiphase galaxy-scale wind away from the plane of the disk that has been studied across the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, we present new velocity-resolved observations of the [C II] 158 μm line in the central disk and the southern outflow of M82 using the upGREAT instrument on board SOFIA. We also report the first detections of velocity-resolved (ΔV = 10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) [C II] emission in the outflow of M82 at projected distances of ≈1-2 kpc south of the galaxy center. We compare the [C II] line profiles to observations of CO and H I and find that likely the majority (&gt;55%) of the [C II] emission in the outflow is associated with the neutral atomic medium. We find that the fraction of [C II] actually outflowing from M82 is small compared to the bulk gas outside the midplane (which may be in a halo or tidal streamers), which has important implications for observations of [C II] outflows at higher redshift. Finally, by comparing the observed ratio of the [C II] and CO intensities to models of photodissociation regions, we estimate that the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field in the disk is ~10<SUP>3.5</SUP> G <SUB>0</SUB>, in agreement with previous estimates. In the outflow, however, the FUV radiation field is 2-3 orders of magnitudes lower, which may explain the high fraction of [C II] arising from the neutral medium in the wind., This repo contains the versions of data and codes as used for the publication of Levy et al. 2023, ApJ. For any use of these codes or data, please cite this zenodo doi and Levy et al. 2023., M82 is the archetypal starburst galaxy in the local Universe. The central burst of star formation, thought to be triggered by its interaction with other group members, drives a multiphase galaxy-scale wind along its minor axis that has been studied across the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, we present new velocity-resolved observations of the [CII] 158μm line in the central disk and southern outflow of M82 using the upGREAT instrument onboard SOFIA. In the disk, we find excellent spatial and kinematic agreement between the [CII] and the molecular gas traced by CO. We also report the first detections of velocity-resolved [CII] in the outflow of M82 at projected distances of 1-2 kpc south of the galaxy center. We compare the [CII] line profiles to CO and HI and find that the majority of the [CII] emission in the outflow is associated with the neutral atomic medium. Moreover, we find that the cold neutral medium (CNM) accounts for &gt;50% of the atomic gas in the outflow. By comparing the observed ratio of the [CII] and CO intensities to models of photodissociation regions, we estimate that the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field in the disk is ~10<SUP>3.5</SUP> G<SUB>0</SUB>, in agreement with previous estimates based on integrated far-infrared data. In the outflow, however, the FUV radiation field is ~500x lower, which may help explain the high CNM fraction in the wind., The center of the nearby galaxy NGC 253 hosts a population of more than a dozen super star clusters (SSCs) that are still in the process of forming. The majority of the star formation of the burst is concentrated in these SSCs, and the starburst is powering a multiphase outflow from the galaxy. In this work, we measure the 350 GHz dust continuum emission toward the center of NGC 253 at 47 mas (0.8 pc) resolution using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We report the detection of 350 GHz (dust) continuum emission in the outflow for the first time, associated with the prominent South-West streamer. In this feature, the dust emission has a width of ≈8 pc, is located at the outer edge of the CO emission, and corresponds to a molecular gas mass of ~(8-17)×10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. In the starburst nucleus, we measure the resolved radial profiles, sizes, and molecular gas masses of the SSCs. Compared to previous work at the somewhat lower spatial resolution, the SSCs here break apart into smaller substructures with radii 0.4-0.7 pc. In projection, the SSCs, dust, and dense molecular gas appear to be arranged as a thin, almost linear, structure roughly 155 pc in length. The morphology and kinematics of this structure can be well explained as gas following x <SUB>2</SUB> orbits at the center of a barred potential. We constrain the morpho-kinematic arrangement of the SSCs themselves, finding that an elliptical, angular-momentum-conserving ring is a good description of both the morphology and kinematics of the SSCs., The bar-fed starburst in the center of the nearby galaxy NGC253 hosts a population of more than a dozen super star clusters (SSCs) revealed by submillimeter observations from ALMA and the VLA. These SSCs are massive (M*≳105 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), compact (R~1 pc), and gas-rich (Mgas/M*~1). At least three of the SSCs show spectral evidence of massive molecular gas outflows, thought to be powered by dust-reprocessed radiation pressure, O star stellar winds, or a combination of both mechanisms. In projection, the SSCs appear as a thin, almost linear, structure about 170 pc in length, reminiscent of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. The individual SSCs are connected by more diffuse dust and molecular gas emission. However, precisely how gas is flowing from the larger scale bar (~2 kpc) down to the nuclear region (~200 pc) to power the nuclear starburst and result in the formation of these SSCs is not well measured. In this work, we use the SSCs themselves as the tracers of the gas flows. We use ALMA observations of the dust continuum and molecular gas emission with a spatial resolution of 47 milliarcseconds (0.8 pc) to morpho-kinematically determine the arrangement of the SSCs in the context of the larger scale bar flows and orbits. From the ALMA spectra, we have precise measurements of the systemic velocities of each of the SSCs. By applying models developed for the CMZ to these observations, we find that the arrangement of the SSCs in NGC253 is consistent with an edge-on ring or crossing streams connected to the larger scale bar, both in terms of the morphology and the kinematics. From these constraints, we can make predictions for model-dependent cluster age gradients, which we will be able to test with our approved Cycle 1 JWST program., Young massive clusters play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies, and feedback from the high-mass stars in these clusters can have profound effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. The nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy NGC 253 at a distance of 3.5 Mpc is a key laboratory in which to study star formation in an extreme environment. Previous high-resolution (1.9 pc) dust continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) discovered 14 compact, massive super star clusters (SSCs) still in formation. We present here ALMA data at 350 GHz with 28 mas (0.5 pc) resolution. We detect blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) toward three of these SSCs in multiple lines, including CS 7-6 and H<SUP>13</SUP>CN 4-3, which represent direct evidence for previously unobserved outflows. The mass contained in these outflows is a significant fraction of the cluster gas masses, which suggests we are witnessing a short but important phase. Further evidence of this is the finding of a molecular shell around the only SSC visible at near-IR wavelengths. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain the outflow geometry, finding that the outflows must be nearly spherical. Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from simulations, we find that none of the available mechanisms completely explains the observations, although dust-reprocessed radiation pressure and O star stellar winds are the most likely candidates. The observed outflows will have a very substantial effect on the clusters' evolution and star formation efficiency., The cycle of star formation affects nearly every aspect of a galaxy. Many phases in the stellar life cycle impart energy and momentum into the surrounding environment. As feedback processes inject energy and momentum into the environment, they necessarily affect the kinematics of the surrounding media. Probing the multiphase gas kinematics through observations of spectral lines is a key method to measure the physics of feedback. My thesis investigates stellar feedback in two regimes: on kiloparsec scales in moderately star-forming galaxies and at sub-parsec scales in a starburst environment. In this talk, I will focus on the latter case. Young massive clusters play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies. A significant fraction of stars in starbursts are believed to form in a massive cluster environment, and feedback from the high-mass stars in these clusters can have profound effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. Characterizing the immediate environment of these clusters is difficult because resolving these compact (r~1 pc) structures in external galaxies requires very high spatial and spectral resolution observations. The nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy NGC253 is a key laboratory in which to study star formation in an extreme environment and, at a distance of 3.5 Mpc, is one of the nearest starburst galaxies. Previous high resolution (1.9 pc) dust continuum observations from ALMA discovered 14 compact, massive super star clusters (SSCs). Using ALMA data at 350 GHz with 28 milliarcsecond (0.5 pc) resolution, we present direct evidence for outflows three of these SSCs in the nuclear starburst of NGC253. We detect blue-shifted absorption and red-shifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) towards three of these SSCs in multiple lines, including CS(7-6) and H<SUP>13</SUP>CN(4-3). The mass contained in these outflows is a non-negligible fraction of the cluster gas masses. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain the outflow opening angles and inclinations, finding that the outflows must be nearly spherical. Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from simulations and semi-analytic models, these outflows are likely powered by a combination of dust-reprocessed radiation pressure and O star winds. We suggest that the three clusters with outflows are among the most evolved in the burst and that the outflows are a result of the gas clearing towards the end of the cluster formation stage. At the current mass outflow rate, these outflows will have a substantial effect on the clusters' evolution and star formation efficiency., Many stages of the stellar life cycle release energy and momentum into the surrounding interstellar medium within a galaxy. This feedback can have profound effects on the host galaxy. This thesis investigates the role of stellar feedback in star-forming galaxies in the local Universe through multiwavelength observations of gas kinematics. First, I study extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) which is thought to be produced by gas ejected from the midplane by repeated supernova explosions. By comparing molecular and ionized gas rotation curves derived from a sub-sample of intermediate inclination star-forming galaxies from the EDGE-CALIFA Survey, I find that ∼75% of my sample galaxies have smaller ionized gas rotation velocities than the molecular gas. I suggest and show that the lower ionized gas rotation velocity can be attributed to a significant contribution from eDIG in a thick disk which rotates more slowly than gas in the midplane. As a direct follow up to this study, I use a sample of edge-on galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey to directly investigate the prevalence, properties, and kinematics of eDIG. I find that 60% of these galaxies show a decrease in the ionized gas rotation velocity as a function of height above the midplane. The ionization of the eDIG is dominated by star-forming complexes. These studies reveal the pervasiveness and importance of this phase in local star-forming galaxies. Next, I study stellar feedback in the extreme environment of the nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy NGC 253. Using ALMA observations with 0.5 pc resolution, I detect blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) in multiple spectral lines towards three of the super star clusters (SSCs). This is direct evidence for outflows of dense molecular gas from these SSCs. Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from simulations, I find that the outflows are most likely powered by dust-reprocessed radiation pressure or Ostar stellar winds. The observed outflows will have very substantial effects on the clusters' evolution. Finally, I find that the arrangement of the SSCs may be morphokinematically consistent with a ring or crossing streams from the larger-scale gas flows which fuel the starburst., Large-scale, multiphase outflows seen in nearby prototypical starburst galaxies, such as NGC253, are thought to be powered by feedback from massive stellar clusters. Resolving these dusty compact structures outside the Milky Way system requires the spectral resolution and sensitivity of ALMA and future facilities such as the ngVLA. Using ALMA data at 350 GHz with 25 milliarcsecond (0.4 pc) resolution, we present direct evidence for outflows from super star clusters (SSCs) in the nuclear starburst of NGC253. We detect blue-shifted absorption and red-shifted emission towards four of the candidate SSCs in multiple lines, including HCN(4-3), H13CN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), and CS(7-6). These P-Cygni profiles are direct evidence for massive outflows from these SSCs. This is the first time outflows from stellar clusters have been identified outside the Milky Way system. The brightest SSC has an outflow velocity of 50 km/s. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain the outflow open ing angles and inclinations. These observations are the first of their kind, showing the formation and feedback of massive stellar clusters. This analysis allows us to determine the feedback SSCs exert on their environment and how the cluster-scales are related to the galaxy-scale outflow. From the high resolution dust continuum data, we identify &gt;20 compact sources, with several of the clusters previously identified at lower resolution (1.9 pc; Leroy et al. 2018) breaking apart into multiple components. By combining this dust continuum data with 36 GHz radio continuum measurements made by the VLA (Gorski et al. 2019), we can constrain the ionizing flux, cluster spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and the cluster mass function (CMF). The CMF is related to the stellar initial mass function (IMF), and these SSCs provide a unique test in a region where a top-heavy IMF may be expected if it exists., We investigate the prevalence, properties, and kinematics of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) in a sample of 25 edge-on galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey. We measure ionized gas scale heights from Hα and find that 90% have measurable scale heights with a median of {0.8}<SUB>-0.4</SUB><SUP>+0.7</SUP> kpc. From the Hα kinematics, we find that 60% of galaxies show a decrease in the rotation velocity as a function of height above the midplane. This lag is characteristic of eDIG, and we measure a median lag of 21 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is comparable to lags measured in the literature. We also investigate variations in the lag with radius. H I lags have been reported to systematically decrease with galactocentric radius. We find both increasing and decreasing ionized gas lags with radius, as well as a large number of galaxies consistent with no radial lag variation, and investigate these results in the context of internal and external origins for the lagging ionized gas. We confirm that the [S II]/Hα and [N II]/Hα line ratios increase with height above the midplane as is characteristic of eDIG. The ionization of the eDIG is dominated by star-forming complexes (leaky H II regions). We conclude that the lagging ionized gas is turbulent ejected gas likely resulting from star formation activity in the disk as opposed to gas in the stellar thick disk or bulge. This is further evidence for the eDIG being a product of stellar feedback and for the pervasiveness of this WIM-like phase in many local star-forming galaxies., We present a comparative study of molecular and ionized gas kinematics in nearby galaxies. These results are based on observations from the EDGE survey, which measured spatially resolved <SUP>12</SUP>CO(J = 1-0) in 126 nearby galaxies. Every galaxy in EDGE has corresponding resolved ionized gas measurements from CALIFA. Using a sub-sample of 17 rotation-dominated, star-forming galaxies where precise molecular gas rotation curves could be extracted, we derive CO and Hα rotation curves using the same geometric parameters out to ≳1 R <SUB> e </SUB>. We find that ∼75% of our sample galaxies have smaller ionized gas rotation velocities than the molecular gas in the outer part of the rotation curve. In no case is the molecular gas rotation velocity measurably lower than that of the ionized gas. We suggest that the lower ionized gas rotation velocity can be attributed to a significant contribution from extraplanar diffuse ionized gas in a thick, turbulence-supported disk. Using observations of the Hγ transition, also available from CALIFA, we measure ionized gas velocity dispersions and find that these galaxies have sufficiently large velocity dispersions to support a thick ionized gas disk. Kinematic simulations show that a thick disk with a vertical rotation velocity gradient can reproduce the observed differences between the CO and Hα rotation velocities. Observed line ratios tracing diffuse ionized gas are elevated compared to typical values in the midplane of the Milky Way. In galaxies affected by this phenomenon, dynamical masses measured using ionized gas rotation curves will be systematically underestimated., We present a systematic comparative study of molecular and ionized gas kinematics in galaxies, the first time such a comparison has been done for a large sample. These results are based on observations obtained by the EDGE survey, which measured spatially resolved <SUP>12</SUP>CO(J=1-0) in 126 nearby galaxies at a typical spatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc. Every galaxy in EDGE has corresponding resolved ionized gas measurements from CALIFA, with a typical spatial resolution of ~1 kpc. Using a sub-sample of 17 galaxies where precise molecular gas rotation curves could be extracted, we derive CO and Hα rotation curves using the same geometric parameters out to ≥ 1 R<SUB>e</SUB> and compare their kinematics. We find that ~80% of our sample have smaller ionized rotation velocities than the molecular gas rotation velocities in the outer part of the rotation curve. In no case is the molecular gas rotation velocity measurably lower than that of the ionized gas. We suggest that this is due to extraplanar diffuse ionized gas in a thick, pressure supported disk which rotates more slowly with increasing height off the plane. Using the high spectral resolution observations available from CALIFA for the same galaxies, we measure Hγ velocity dispersions. We find that the galaxies in our subsample have sufficiently large ionized gas velocity dispersions to support a thick ionized gas disk. We perform kinematic simulations of thick disks and show that a thick disk with a vertical velocity gradient can reproduce the observed differences between the CO and Hα rotation velocities. There are no trends in the difference between the CO and Hα rotation velocities with global parameters, such as inclination, star formation rate, or morphology. We note, however, that nearly all of our galaxies exceed the star formation rate per unit area needed to have an extended diffuse ionized phase., We report findings from the Magellanic Mopra Assessment (MAGMA) Dense Gas Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which comprises spectra of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), HCN(1-0), and HNC(1-0) toward 48 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) distributed across the LMC. <SUP>12</SUP>CO(1-0) and <SUP>13</SUP>CO(1-0) data from the MAGMA survey were also included. These molecules trace dense gas and hence are the ingredients of future star formation. We investigate possible correlations between the dense gas tracers and various physical and dynamical properties across the LMC. No correlation between the dense gas fraction (CO/HCN) and the position of the parent GMC is observed in the LMC. We compare our <SUP>12</SUP>CO data in these clouds to the 70 micron flux at those locations and find that our results are not consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law. However we do find that star formation rate is linearly correlated with the dense gas as traced by HCN. This further validates the usefulness of HCN to trace the dense gas in the molecular clouds. The analogous correlation using HCO<SUP>+</SUP> is found to be more complex.

For example, the timescale parameters of a second-order CARMA (continuous-time autoregressive moving average) process have relationships to Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and bolometric luminosity of AGN. There is mounting evidence that some AGN also exhibit non-stochastic and perhaps nonlinear variability. For example, over half of a sample of AGN observed by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) were found to contain nonlinearity using recurrence plots with differing variability characteristics between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN dependent on Eddington ratio. Of the 1105 AGN observed by the 157-month catalog of BAT, 387 fall within the field-of-view of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We generate recurrence plot images of the ZTF light curves of the 387 AGN and apply machine learning techniques on the resulting images. We compare the recurrence plot properties of the AGN to other physical characteristics of each system (e.g., spectroscopic type) and other statistical models (e.g., the CARMA parameters). We find that the recurrence plot uncovers higher-order variability features that complement stochastic modeling., Accreting compact object systems exhibit variability in their luminosity on many timescales ranging from milliseconds to hundreds of days. Current studies seek to connect the ubiquitously complex variability of accreting systems to their accretion properties and environment, probing commonalities across decades of mass. Recent studies using the recurrence analysis method from nonlinear dynamics have uncovered relationships between the classes of AGN and the spectral states of XRBs and their temporal variability, categorized as stochastic, deterministic, or chaotic. Recurrence analysis shows promise in critically probing distinct classes of variability among systems with different accretion flows. However, these studies have all been applied to the light curves of XRBs and AGN that are evenly sampled in the X-ray bandpasses. In this work, we extend the application of recurrence analysis to light curves with irregular cadence typical of ground-based optical observatories, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility. We generate recurrence plots of synthetic light curves of dynamical systems as well as real systems and use machine learning methodologies to determine the impact of seasonal gaps and irregular cadence on classifications of variability. We find the recurrence plot is an effective tool for classifying the temporal variability features of accreting and dynamical systems alike for both all-sky monitors and ground-based time domain observatories., Accreting compact object systems exhibit variability in their luminosity on many timescales ranging from milliseconds to hundreds of days.

Recently, the recurrence analysis method from nonlinear dynamics has been used to uncover relationships between the classes of AGN and the spectral states of XRBs and their temporal variability, categorized as stochastic, deterministic, or chaotic. Recurrence analysis thus shows promise in critically probing distinct classes of variability among systems with different accretion flows.

In this work, we extend the application of recurrence analysis to light curves with irregular cadence typical of ground-based optical observatories, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility. We generate recurrence plots of synthetic light curves of dynamical systems as well as real systems (e.g., GRS 1915+105) and use machine learning methodologies to determine the impact of seasonal gaps and irregular cadence on classifications of variability. We find the recurrence plot is an effective tool for classifying the temporal variability features of accreting and dynamical systems alike for both all-sky monitors and ground-based time domain observatories., We present results of recurrence analysis of 46 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using light curves from the 157-month catalogue of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in the 14-150 keV band. We generate recurrence plots and compute recurrence plot metrics for each object. We use the surrogate data method to compare all derived recurrence-based quantities to three sets of stochastic light curves with identical power spectrum, flux distribution, or both, in order to determine the presence of determinism, non-linearity, entropy, and non-stationarity. We compare these quantities with known physical characteristics of each system, such as black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and bolometric luminosity, radio loudness, obscuration, and spectroscopic type. We find that almost all AGNs in this sample exhibit substantial higher order modes of variability than is contained in the power spectrum, with approximately half exhibiting non-linear or non-stationary behaviour. We find that Type 2 AGNs are more likely to contain deterministic variability than Type 1 AGNs, while the same distinction is not found between obscured and unobscured AGNs. The complexity of variability among Type 1 AGNs is anticorrelated with Eddington ratio, while no relationship is found among Type 2 AGNs. The connections between the recurrence properties and AGN class suggest that hard X-ray emission is a probe of distinct accretion processes among classes of AGNs, which supports interpretations of changing-look AGNs and challenges the traditional unification model that classifies AGNs only on viewing angle., Accreting compact object systems such as X-ray Binaries (XRBs) exhibit variability in their luminosity on many timescales ranging from milliseconds to hundreds of days. The fundamental structure of the accretion flow and how it evolves to result in the observed variability is not well known. The expectation is that there are simultaneous, and interconnected, random and chaotic or periodic components in the light curves of accretion disk systems, operating on different timescales. The strength of each component is dependent on the dominant sources of instability in the accretion flow and the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations. Metrics derived from recurrence analysis specifically probe the strength and nature of nonlinearity, or lack thereof, in time series and consequently can provide information about the dominating physical mechanisms at play. We perform a pilot study of canonical XRBs monitored by RXTE and MAXI over two decades and compare their measured dynamical variability via recurrence analysis to an ensemble of simulated classical dynamical systems including first and second order continuous autoregressive processes, multi- and quasi-periodicity, noise, and chaos. We find XRBs across spectral classes align with distinct dynamical systems, which suggests that the spectral state of the accretion flow correlates with the dynamical classification of the light curve., We present results of recurrence analysis of 46 active galactic nuclei (AGN) using light curves from the 70 month catalog of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in the 14-150 keV band. Recent applications of recurrence analysis, an alternative method to Fourier analysis, have shown promise in characterizing the abundantly varied and higher modes of variability and timescales in AGN. Recurrence analysis provides complementary information about the nature of the underlying physics in these objects. We use the surrogate data method to compare all derived recurrence-based quantities of our sample to three sets of stochastic light curves with identical power spectrum, flux distribution, or both, in order to determine the presence of non-linearity and non-stationarity. We compare these quantities with known physical characteristics of each system, such as black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and bolometric and X-ray luminosities, and multi-wavelength astronomical properties (e.g., radio loud vs. quiet, obscured vs. unobscured, beamed vs. un-beamed) and spectroscopic type. We find that almost all AGN in this sample exhibit substantial higher order modes of variability than is contained in the power spectrum, with approximately half exhibiting nonlinear or non-stationary behavior. In particular, we find that Type 1 AGN are more likely to exhibit possible nonlinear or nonstationary behavior versus Type 2 AGN, and radio loud sources are more likely to contain linear deterministic behavior than radio quiet sources., The advent of new time domain surveys and the imminent increase in astronomical data expose the shortcomings of traditional time series analysis (such as power spectra analysis) in characterizing the abundantly varied, complex, and stochastic light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Recent applications of novel methods from non-linear dynamics have shown promise in characterizing higher modes of variability and time-scales in AGN. Recurrence analysis in particular can provide complementary information about characteristic time-scales revealed by other methods, as well as probe the nature of the underlying physics in these objects. Recurrence analysis was developed to study dynamical trajectories in phase space, which can be constructed from 1D time series such as light curves. We apply the methods of recurrence analysis to two optical light curves of Kepler-monitored AGN. We confirm the detection and period of an optical quasi-periodic oscillation in one AGN, and confirm multiple other time-scales recovered from other methods ranging from 5 to 60 d in both objects. We detect regions in the light curves that deviate from regularity, provide evidence of determinism and non-linearity in the mechanisms underlying one light curve (KIC 9650712), and determine realizations of a linear stochastic process describe the dominant variability in the other light curve (Zwicky 229-015). We discuss possible underlying processes driving the dynamics of the light curves and their diverse classes of variability., The onset of new time domain surveys and the imminent increase in astronomical data exposes the shortcomings in traditional time series analysis (such as power spectra analysis) in characterizing the abundantly varied, complex and stochastic light curves of both X-ray Binaries (XRBs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Recent applications of alternative methods to Fourier analysis have shown promise in characterizing higher modes of variability and timescales in AGN. Methods of analysis developed to study the recurrences of dynamical trajectories in phase space, which can be constructed from one-dimensional time series such as light curves, provide complementary information about not only characteristic timescales revealed by other methods, but also direct indications of the nature of the underlying physics in these objects. Studying a light curve in an embedded phase space provides an alternative perspective of the dynamics that generate the light curve, which can be leveraged to complement and compensate for other methods. We apply methods from nonlinear dynamics to a sample of optical light curves of Kepler-monitored AGN, X-ray light curves of XRBs monitored by RXTE and MAXI, and hard X-ray light curves of XRBs and AGN observed by Swift/BAT. We detect regions in the light curves that deviate from regularity, indicate deterministic mechanisms, and reveal evidence of nonlinearity and chaos in some XRBs. We provide evidence for the types of possible underlying processes driving the dynamics of the light curves and their diverse classes of variability. We propose future application of novel methods of analysis to a larger sample and other time-varying systems in preparation for future time domain missions., The light curves in multiple bandwidths of many black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) are complex and resist traditional time series analysis techniques (Phillipson et al. 2018). Recurrence plots (RPs) and their quantitative analysis (RQA) were developed to study recurrences of dynamical trajectories in phase space. The structures present in RPs correlate to specific types of dynamical behavior in a system, including periodic, stochastic and chaotic motion, which are features of particular interest in the light curves of XRBs and AGN. The quantification of the structures in RPs has been applied to many fields, most recently in the characterization of stochastic behavior and nonlinear instabilities in the X-ray variability of microquasars, and the stability of orbits of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of extrasolar systems. We apply the methods of RPs and their quantification to the three-year optical light curve of a Kepler AGN, which has been identified with a possible low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (Smith et al. 2018) corresponding to a temporal period of 44 days, and the X-ray light curves of four well-studied black hole XRBs from the RXTE, MAXI, and NuSTAR observatories. We provide evidence for traces of periodic, stochastic, and nonlinear, possibly chaotic, behavior in these light curves and compare to the results from our recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations., The low-mass X-ray binary 4U1705-44 exhibits dramatic long-term X-ray time variability with a time-scale of several hundred days. The All-Sky Monitor (ASM) aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Japanese Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) aboard the International Space Station together have continuously observed the source from 1995 December through 2014 May. The combined ASM-MAXI data provide a continuous time series over 50 times the length of the time-scale of interest. Topological analysis can help us identify `fingerprints' in the phase space of a system unique to its equations of motion. The Birman-Williams theorem postulates that if such fingerprints are the same between two systems, then their equations of motion must be closely related. The phase-space embedding of the source light curve shows a strong resemblance to the double-welled non-linear Duffing oscillator. We explore a range of parameters for which the Duffing oscillator closely mirrors the time evolution of 4U1705-44. We extract low period, unstable periodic orbits from the 4U1705-44 and Duffing time series and compare their topological information. The Duffing and 4U1705-44 topological properties are identical, providing strong evidence that they share the same underlying template. This suggests that we can look to the Duffing equation to help guide the development of a physical model to describe the long-term X-ray variability of this and other similarly behaved X-ray binary systems., We present three-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations of initially thin accretion disks with self-gravity using the grid-based code PLUTO. We produce simulated light curves and spectral energy distributions and compare to observational data of X-ray binary (XRB) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) variability. These simulations are of interest for modeling the role of radiation in accretion physics across decades of mass and frequency. In particular, the characteristics of the time variability in various bandwidths can probe the timescales over which different physical processes dominate the accretion flow. For example, in the case of some XRBs, superorbital periods much longer than the companion orbital period have been observed. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations have shown that irradiation-driven warping could be the mechanism underlying these long periods. In the case of AGN, irradiation-driven warping is also predicted to occur in addition to strong outflows originating from thermal and radiation pressure driving forces, which are important processes in understanding feedback and star formation in active galaxies. We compare our simulations to various toy models via traditional time series analysis of our synthetic and observed light curves., The neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U1705-44, which exhibited high amplitude long-term X-ray variability on the order of hundreds of days during the 16-year continuous monitoring by the RXTE ASM (1995-2012), entered an anomalously long high state in July 2012 as observed by MAXI (2009-present)., Accreting black hole systems such as X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei exhibit variability in their luminosity on many timescales ranging from milliseconds to tens of days, and even hundreds of days. The mechanism(s) driving this variability and the relationship between short- and long-term variability is poorly understood. Current studies on accretion disks seek to determine how the changes in black hole mass, the rate at which mass accretes onto the central black hole, and the external environment affect the variability on scales ranging from stellar-mass black holes to supermassive black holes. Traditionally, the fluid mechanics equations governing accretion disks have been simplified by considering only the kinematics of the disk, and perhaps magnetic fields, in order for their phenomenological behavior to be predicted analytically. We seek to employ numerical techniques to study accretion disks including more complicated physics traditionally ignored in order to more accurately understand their behavior over time. We present a proof-of-concept three dimensional, global simulation using the astrophysical hydrodynamic code PLUTO of a simplified thin disk model about a central black hole which will serve as the basis for development of more complicated models including external effects such as radiation and magnetic fields. We also develop a tool to generate a synthetic light curve that displays the variability in luminosity of the simulation over time. The preliminary simulation and accompanying synthetic light curve demonstrate that PLUTO is a reliable code to perform sophisticated simulations of accretion disk systems which can then be compared to observational results., The bright low-mass X-ray binary 4U1705-44 exhibits long-term semi-periodic variability with a timescale of several hundred days. The All-Sky Monitor (ASM) aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Japanese X-ray All-Sky Monitor (MAXI) aboard the International Space Station together have continuously observed the source from December 1995 through the present. The combined ASM-MAXI data provides a continuous time series over fifty times the length of the timescale of interest. The phase space embedding of the flux versus its first derivative shows a strong resemblance to a double-welled nonlinear oscillator. When comparing our time series against well-known nonlinear oscillators, we find that 4U1705-44 exhibits behavior akin to the Duffing oscillator. Topological analysis can help us identify ‘fingerprints’ in the phase space of a system unique to its equations of motion. If such ‘fingerprints’ are the same between two systems, then their equations of motion must be closely related. We therefore found a range of parameters for which the Duffing oscillator closely follows the time evolution of 4U1705-44 and from this range chose 6 different numerical Duffing time series. We can extract low-period, unstable periodic orbits from both the 4U1705-44 and numerical Duffing time series and compare their topological information in phase space, such as their relative rotation rates. We argue that the associated period-1 orbit in 4U1705-44 has a period between 130 and 170 days. The driving periods of our 6 numerical time series correspond to 140 to 175 days. Assigning a logical sequence name to each orbit, the relative rotation rates can be compiled into a unique ‘intertwining’ matrix. The numerical Duffing time series and the 4U1705-44 intertwining matrices are identical, which provides strong evidence that they share the same underlying template. The implications of this equivalence suggests that we can look to the Duffing equation to describe the X-ray binary’s variability.","['2024AAS...24330211P', '2023HEAD...2011732P', '2023AAS...24130236P', 'arXiv:2211.13774', '2023MNRAS.518.4372P', '10.48550/arXiv.2211.13774', '2022arXiv221113774P', '10.1093/mnras/stac3419', '2022MNRAS.tmp.3186P', '2022HEAD...1920006P', '2021AAS...23722609P', '10.48550/arXiv.2001.02800', '2020arXiv200102800P', '2020MNRAS.tmp.2189P', '2020MNRAS.497.3418P', 'arXiv:2001.02800', '10.1093/mnras/staa2069', '2020AAS...23612202P', '2019AAS...23324319P', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.06393', '2018MNRAS.tmp..940P', '2018arXiv180906393P', '2018MNRAS.477.5220P', 'arXiv:1809.06393', '10.1093/mnras/sty970', '2018AAS...23124426P', '2017ATel10742....1P', '2017ATel.10742...1P', '2017HEAD...1610842P', '2016HEAD...1512032P']","[('variability', 41), ('light', 40), ('curve', 40), ('time', 35), ('recurrence', 31), ('agn', 30), ('system', 29), ('analysis', 28), ('ray', 25), ('accretion', 16)]","[(('light', 'curve'), 40), (('recurrence', 'analysis'), 15), (('time', 'series'), 15), (('black', 'hole'), 11), (('recurrence', 'plot'), 11), (('ray', 'binary'), 10), (('phase', 'space'), 9), (('active', 'galactic'), 8), (('galactic', 'nucleus'), 8), (('hundred', 'day'), 7)]","[(('active', 'galactic', 'nuclei'), 8), (('galactic', 'nuclei', 'agn'), 5), (('light', 'curves', 'xrbs'), 5), (('black', 'hole', 'mass'), 4), (('exhibit', 'variability', 'luminosity'), 4), (('variability', 'luminosity', 'timescales'), 4), (('luminosity', 'timescales', 'ranging'), 4), (('timescales', 'ranging', 'milliseconds'), 4), (('curves', 'xrbs', 'agn'), 4), (('stochastic', 'light', 'curves'), 4)]",Dirty

We propose to use a new large-volume hydrodynamic simulation, BonFIRE, to bridge this gap and make robust predictions for early galaxy formation that are ideal for comparison with JWST observations. BonFIRE will simultaneously leverage high resolution and a large volume to make robust predictions for the formation histories of early galaxies and the statistical evolution of the galaxy population at z=8-20. The simulation will allow us to address crucial questions about the onset of galaxy formation, the conditions for early galaxy formation, the number of early galaxies, the role of galaxies in reionizing the Universe, and the emergence of disk morphology. Using BonFIRE, we will make predictions for the ultraviolet luminosity function, the number density of massive galaxies, and the physical mechanisms driving the growth of early galaxies. We plan to re-run the simulation with additional physics models such as AGN feedback and Population III stars to test their effects on the high-redshift galaxy population. We will also generate and publicly release mock observations of the simulated galaxies for direct comparison to observations from JWST. This work will provide insight into the conditions for galaxy formation in the early Universe and set a critical theoretical benchmark for observations of high-redshift galaxies., Data from the first year of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a surprisingly high amount of star formation at high redshifts. These results raise the question of whether standard LCDM-based galaxy formation theory is missing something essential about star formation in the early Universe. We have run a new hydrodynamic simulation, BonFIRE, using the latest galaxy formation models from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project (FIRE-3) to bridge the gap between observations of high-redshift galaxies and theoretical galaxy formation. Leveraging BonFIRE's high resolution, large volume (L = 41.2 cMpc), and high snapshot cadence, we can investigate critical questions about the onset and evolution of star formation in early galaxies at z=8-20. Preliminary results from BonFIRE show a significant cosmic stellar mass density at z=8, indicative of a rapid build-up of stellar mass in the early Universe. Crucially, this result uses physics that were set prior to any knowledge of JWST results. Using BonFIRE, we further quantify the burstiness of this prolific early star formation and make predictions for stellar mass and ultraviolet luminosity functions at z&gt;8., Low-mass galaxies are highly susceptible to environmental effects that can efficiently quench star formation. We explore the role of ram pressure in quenching low-mass galaxies ($M_{*}\sim 10^{5}{-}10^{9}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$) within 2 Mpc of Milky Way (MW) hosts using the FIRE-2 simulations. Ram pressure is highly variable across different environments, within individual MW haloes, and for individual low-mass galaxies over time. The impulsiveness of ram pressure - the maximum ram pressure scaled to the integrated ram pressure prior to quenching - correlates with whether a galaxy is quiescent or star forming. The time-scale between maximum ram pressure and quenching is anticorrelated with impulsiveness, such that high impulsiveness corresponds to quenching time-scales &lt;1 Gyr. Galaxies in low-mass groups ($M_\mathrm{*,host}10^{7}{-}10^{9}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$) outside of MW haloes experience typical ram pressure only slightly lower than ram pressure on MW satellites, helping to explain effective quenching via group preprocessing. Ram pressure on MW satellites rises sharply with decreasing distance to the host, and, at a fixed physical distance, more recent pericentre passages are typically associated with higher ram pressure because of greater gas density in the inner host halo at late times. Furthermore, the ram pressure and gas density in the inner regions of Local Group-like paired host haloes are higher at small angles off the host galaxy disc compared to isolated hosts. The quiescent fraction of satellites within these low-latitude regions is also elevated in the simulations and observations, signaling possible anisotropic quenching via ram pressure around MW-mass hosts., Low-mass galaxies are particularly compelling laboratories for star formation quenching because they are highly susceptible to quenching effects from both internal stellar feedback and external environment. We explore the role of ram pressure in the environmental regulation of gas content and quenching of low-mass galaxies around Milky Way (MW) mass hosts from the FIRE simulations. The quiescent fraction of low-mass galaxies increases as their stellar mass decreases and as their distance to a MW-mass host decreases, similar to the Local Group. In addition, the location of a satellite at quenching (in a MW halo, a low-mass group, or in isolation) and the timing of quenching with respect to different events like infall or pericenter passage depend on the mass of the satellite galaxy. We find that MW satellites can be efficiently quenched before infall into a MW halo by pre-processing in low-mass groups, where they experience ram pressure comparable to that in a MW halo. Interestingly, the density of halo gas near paired Local Group-like hosts is enhanced at small angles/latitudes off the host galaxy disk versus directly above or below the disk. Preliminary results indicate that satellites within these low-latitude regions may be preferentially quenched, similar to recently reported anisotropic quenching in massive galaxy clusters., The star formation and gas content of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) are depleted relative to more isolated galaxies in the Local Group (LG) at fixed stellar mass. We explore the environmental regulation of gas content and quenching of star formation in z = 0 galaxies at $M_{*}=10^{5\!-\!10}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$ around 14 MW-mass hosts from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) simulations. Lower mass satellites ($M_{*}\lesssim 10^7\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$) are mostly quiescent and higher mass satellites ($M_{*}\gtrsim 10^8\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$) are mostly star forming, with intermediate-mass satellites ($M_{*}\approx 10^{7\!-\!8}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$) split roughly equally between quiescent and star forming. Hosts with more gas in their circumgalactic medium have a higher quiescent fraction of massive satellites ($M_{*}=10^{8\!-\!9}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$). We find no significant dependence on isolated versus paired (LG-like) host environments, and the quiescent fractions of satellites around MW-mass and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations are remarkably similar. Environmental effects that lead to quenching can also occur as pre-processing in low-mass groups prior to MW infall. Lower mass satellites typically quenched before MW infall as central galaxies or rapidly during infall into a low-mass group or a MW-mass galaxy. Most intermediate- to high-mass quiescent satellites have experienced ≥1-2 pericentre passages (≈2.5-5 Gyr) within a MW-mass halo. Most galaxies with $M_{*}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$ did not quench before falling into a host, indicating a possible upper mass limit for isolated quenching. The simulations reproduce the average trend in the LG quiescent fraction across the full range of satellite stellar masses. Though the simulations are consistent with the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey's quiescent fraction at $M_{*}\gtrsim 10^8\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$, they do not generally reproduce SAGA's turnover at lower masses., We examine the prevalence, longevity, and causes of planes of satellite dwarf galaxies, as observed in the Local Group. We use 14 Milky Way/Andromeda-(MW/M31) mass host galaxies from the Feedback In Realistic Environments-2 simulations. We select the 14 most massive satellites by stellar mass within $d_\mathrm{host}\le 300\mathrm{\, kpc}$ of each host and correct for incompleteness from the foreground galactic disc when comparing to the MW. We find that MW-like planes as spatially thin and/or kinematically coherent as observed are uncommon, but they do exist in our simulations. Spatially thin planes occur in 1-2 per cent of snapshots during z = 0-0.2, and kinematically coherent planes occur in 5 per cent of snapshots. These planes are generally transient, surviving for &lt;500 Myr. However, if we select hosts with a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite near first pericentre, the fraction of snapshots with MW-like planes increases dramatically to 7-16 per cent, with lifetimes of 0.7-1 Gyr, likely because of group accretion of satellites. We find that M31's satellite distribution is much more common: M31's satellites lie within ~1σ of the simulation median for every plane metric we consider. We find no significant difference in average satellite planarity for isolated hosts versus hosts in LG-like pairs. Baryonic and dark matter-only simulations exhibit similar levels of planarity, even though baryonic subhaloes are less centrally concentrated within their host haloes. We conclude that planes of satellites are not a strong challenge to ΛCDM cosmology., Reproducing the spatial and kinematic distribution of satellite dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG) is an important test of both physical models and numerical resolution in simulations. Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations, we examine the radial distributions of satellites with stellar masses of at least 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB> around 14 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like host galaxies. We find excellent agreement with the inner radial profiles of the MW and M31, and our results suggest more undiscovered classical dwarf-mass satellites in the LG. We also examine the 3D spatial distribution and kinematics of LG satellites in the context of satellite planes. Simulated satellites are usually distributed nearly isotropically around their hosts, but there are a few systems whose satellite populations lie within thin planes. We find that hosts with an LMC-like satellite near first pericenter are more likely to have MW-like satellite planes that are also longer-lived, likely because of group accretion of satellites., While many tensions between Local Group (LG) satellite galaxies and Λ cold dark matter cosmology have been alleviated through recent cosmological simulations, the spatial distribution of satellites remains an important test of physical models and physical versus numerical disruption in simulations. Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations, we examine the radial distributions of satellites with M_*&gt; 10^5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> around eight isolated Milky Way (MW) mass host galaxies and four hosts in LG-like pairs. We demonstrate that these simulations resolve the survival and physical destruction of satellites with M_*≳ 10^5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The simulations broadly agree with LG observations, spanning the radial profiles around the MW and M31. This agreement does not depend strongly on satellite mass, even at distances ≲100 kpc. Host-to-host variation dominates the scatter in satellite counts within 300 kpc of the hosts, while time variation dominates scatter within 50 kpc. More massive host galaxies within our sample have fewer satellites at small distances, likely because of enhanced tidal destruction of satellites via the baryonic discs of host galaxies. Furthermore, we quantify and provide fits to the tidal depletion of subhaloes in baryonic relative to dark matter-only simulations as a function of distance. Our simulated profiles imply observational incompleteness in the LG even at M_*≳ 10^5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>: we predict 2-10 such satellites to be discovered around the MW and possibly 6-9 around M31. To provide cosmological context, we compare our results with the radial profiles of satellites around MW analogues in the SAGA survey, finding that our simulations are broadly consistent with most SAGA systems., version 0.0.6, Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has recently upgraded its Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS12) to provide a comprehensive study of the complex internal structure and dynamics of the nucleon. The upgrade includes new detectors such as the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH). The RICH will use multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMTs) for the detection of Cherenkov photons. Our study compared two models of Hamamatsu MAPMTs (H8500 and H12700) under consideration for the CLAS12 RICH in terms of their single photoelectron (SPE) peak, dark current, and crosstalk. The MAPMTs were tested inside a light-tight box, using a low intensity laser to simulate single photoelectron events similar to Cherenkov radiation. The H12700's SPE peaks were on average 78% the width of the H8500's peaks. For both models, the probability of dark current was on the order of 10<SUP>-4</SUP>. The probability of crosstalk for H8500s was 1.6 to 2.7 times that for H12700s. The H12700s were deemed better because they had negligible crosstalk and dark current while providing a narrower peak for single photoelectron events. <P />Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship.","['2024jwst.prop.6278S', '2024AAS...24325103S', '2022arXiv221207518S', '10.1093/mnras/stad2576', '2023MNRAS.525.3849S', '2023MNRAS.tmp.2436S', 'arXiv:2212.07518', '10.48550/arXiv.2212.07518', '2023AAS...24126005S', '2022arXiv220307385S', '10.48550/arXiv.2203.07385', 'arXiv:2203.07385', '2022MNRAS.514.5276S', '2022MNRAS.tmp.1660S', '10.1093/mnras/stac1706', '10.1093/mnras/stab955', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.08571', '2020arXiv201008571S', 'arXiv:2010.08571', '2021MNRAS.tmp..945S', '2021MNRAS.504.1379S', '2021AAS...23721002S', 'arXiv:1904.11508', '2019arXiv190411508S', '10.48550/arXiv.1904.11508', '10.1093/mnras/stz3054', '2019MNRAS.tmp.2638S', '2020MNRAS.491.1471S', '2018zndo...1489937S', '10.5281/zenodo.1489937', '2015APS..APR.D1054S']","[('galaxy', 46), ('satellite', 45), ('mass', 39), ('host', 34), ('mw', 30), ('simulation', 25), ('formation', 17), ('quenching', 15), ('group', 15), ('low', 14)]","[(('ram', 'pressure'), 14), (('low', 'mass'), 11), (('rm', 'odot'), 9), (('mw', 'mass'), 9), (('galaxy', 'formation'), 8), (('star', 'formation'), 8), (('stellar', 'mass'), 8), (('mass', 'galaxy'), 7), (('local', 'group'), 7), (('host', 'galaxy'), 7)]","[(('low', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 6), (('high', 'redshift', 'galaxy'), 3), (('feedback', 'realistic', 'environments'), 3), (('hosts', 'fire', 'simulations'), 3), (('low', 'mass', 'groups'), 3), (('ram', 'pressure', 'mw'), 3), (('mw', 'mass', 'hosts'), 3), (('mw', 'mass', 'host'), 3), (('local', 'group', 'lg'), 3), (('gtrsim', 'rm', 'odot'), 3)]",Dirty

Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on ""fast"" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors., , Neutrinos can rapidly change flavor in the inner dense regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers due to the neutrino fast flavor instability. If the amount of flavor transformation is significant, the fast flavor instability (FFI) could significantly affect how supernovae explode and how supernovae and mergers enrich the universe with heavy elements. Since many state of the art supernova and merger simulations rely on neutrino transport algorithms based on angular moments of the radiation field, there is incomplete information with which to determine if the distributions are unstable to the FFI. In this work we test the performance of several proposed moment-based instability tests in the literature. We perform time-independent general relativistic neutrino transport on a snapshot of a 3D neutron star merger simulation to generate reasonable neutrino distributions and check where each of these criteria correctly predict instability. In addition, we offer a new ""maximum entropy"" instability test that is somewhat more complex, but offers more detailed (though still approximate) estimates of electron lepton number crossing width and depth. We find that this maximum entropy test and the resonant trajectory test are particularly accurate at predicting instability in this snapshot, though all tests predict instability where significant flavor transformation is most likely., The fast flavor instability (FFI) is expected to be ubiquitous in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. It rapidly shuffles neutrino flavor in a way that could impact the explosion mechanism, neutrino signals, mass outflows, and nucleosynthesis. The variety of initial conditions and simulation methods employed in simulations of the FFI prevent an apples-to-apples comparison of the results. We simulate a standardized test problem using five independent codes and verify that they are all faithfully simulating the underlying quantum kinetic equations under the assumptions of axial symmetry and homogeneity in two directions. We quantify the amount of numerical error in each method and demonstrate that each method is superior in at least one metric of this error. We make the results publicly available to serve as a benchmark., The neutrino fast flavor instability (FFI) can change neutrino flavor on time scales of nanoseconds and length scales of centimeters. It is expected to be ubiquitous in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially modifying the neutrino signal we see, how matter is ejected from these explosions, and the types of heavy elements that form in the ejecta and enrich the universe. There has been a great deal of recent interest in understanding the role the FFI plays in supernovae and mergers, but the short length and time scales and the strong nonlinearity have prevented the FFI from being included consistently in these models. We review the theoretical nature of the FFI starting with the quantum kinetic equations, where the instability exists in neutron star mergers and supernovae, and how the instability behaves after saturation in simplified simulations. We review the proposed methods to test for instability in moment-based calculations where the full distribution is not available and describe the numerical methods used to simulate the instability directly. Finally, we close by outlining the trajectory toward realistic, self-consistent models that will allow a more complete understanding of the impact of the FFI in supernovae and mergers., Neutrino flavor instabilities have the potential to shuffle neutrinos between electron, mu, and tau flavor states, possibly modifying the core-collapse supernova mechanism and the heavy elements ejected from neutron star mergers. Analytic methods indicate the presence of so-called fast flavor transformation instabilities, and numerical simulations can be used to probe the nonlinear evolution of the neutrinos. Simulations of the fast flavor instability to date have been performed assuming imposed symmetries. We perform simulations of the fast flavor instability that include all three spatial dimensions and all relevant momentum dimensions in order to probe the validity of these approximations. If the fastest growing mode has a wave number along a direction of imposed symmetry, then the instability can be suppressed. The late-time equilibrium distribution of flavor, however, seems to be little affected by the number of spatial dimensions. This is a promising hint that the results of lower-dimensionality simulations to date have predictions that are robust against their the number of spatial dimensions, though simulations of a wider variety of neutrino distributions need to be carried out to support this claim more generally., Neutrinos drive core-collapse supernovae, launch outflows from neutron star merger accretion disks, and set the ratio of protons to neutrons in ejecta from both systems that generate heavy elements in the Universe. Neutrinos of different flavors interact with matter differently, and much recent work has suggested that fast flavor instabilities are likely ubiquitous in both systems, but the final flavor content after the instability saturates has not been well understood. In this work we present particle-in-cell calculations which follow the evolution of all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos through saturation and kinematic decoherence. We conduct one-dimensional three-flavor simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics to demonstrate the outcome of this instability in a few example cases. We demonstrate the growth of both axially symmetric and asymmetric modes whose wavelength and growth rate match predictions from linear stability analysis. Finally, we vary the number density, flux magnitude, and flux direction of the neutrinos and antineutrinos and demonstrate that these factors modify both the growth rate and postsaturation neutrino flavor abundances. Weak electron lepton number crossings in these simulations produce both slow growth of the instability and little difference between the flavor abundances in the initial and final states. In all of these calculations the same number of neutrinos and antineutrinos change flavor, making the least abundant between them the limiting factor for postsaturation flavor change. Many more simulations and multidimensional simulations are needed to fully probe the parameter space of the initial conditions., Neutrinos transport energy, drive outflows, and determine the ratio of electrons to protons in the ejecta from neutron star mergers that enriches the surrounding universe with heavy elements. Only electron flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos modify the composition of the ejecta and thus directly affect the synthesis of heavy elements. Instabilities that cause rapid mixing of neutrino flavor are likely ubiquitous in mergers, but are poorly understood and are absent from global simulations. I will present the first (local) three-dimensional simulations of this instability using the new open-source particle-in-cell neutrino quantum kinetics code Emu. I will demonstrate that the growth phase of the instability matches theoretical predictions, describe abundances of each neutrino species after the instability saturates, and discuss the implications for nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. <P />NSF Award No. 2001760; N3AS Fellowship under NSF Grant PHY-1630782 and HSF Grant 2017-228; Exascale Computing Project (DOE Office of Science and NNSA Grant 17-SC-20-SC); simulations performed on the Bridges system (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, NSF award ACI-1445606), Cori (NERSC, DOE), and Summit (Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, DOE)., Many modern simulations of accretion disks use moment-based methods for radiation transport to determine the thermal evolution of the disk and the properties of the ejected matter. The popular M1 scheme that evolves the rank-0 and rank-1 moments requires an analytic approximation for the rank-2 and higher tensors. We present the open-source Monte Carlo steady-state general-relativistic neutrino transport code SedonuGR, which we use to assess fundamental analytic closure assumptions, quantify proposed closure errors, and test an extension of the maximum entropy Fermi-Dirac (MEFD) closure to the rank-3 moment. We demonstrate that the fundamental assumptions employed in all analytic closures are strongly violated. This violation is most evident at the interface between the equatorial disk and the evacuated polar regions. Finally, we calculate the neutrino momentum and energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation, and demonstrate that a moment-based annihilation power calculation is accurate to at most ∼20 % if the rank-2 and higher moments are neglected. Out of a selection of eight closures in the literature, we demonstrate that different closures reproduce different aspects of the radiation field (pressure tensor, rank-3 tensor, pair annihilation rate), though the MEFD, Levermore, and Janka 2 closures are all reasonable. The extra information from the neutrino degeneracy used in the MEFD closure is unable to account for the diversity in the rank-2 and rank-3 moments., SedonuGR is a steady-state general relativistic multidimensional Monte Carlo neutrino radiation transport code., Neutrinos play a critical role of transporting energy and changing the lepton density within corecollapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) combine the effects of neutrino-matter interactions treated in classical Boltzmann transport with the neutrino flavor-changing effects treated in neutrino oscillation calculations. We present a method for extending existing neutrino interaction rates to full QKE source terms for use in numerical calculations. We demonstrate the effects of absorption and emission by nucleons and nuclei, electron scattering, electron-positron pair annihilation, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung, neutrino-neutrino scattering. For the first time, we include all these collision terms self-consistently in a simulation of the full isotropic QKEs in conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. For our choice of parameters, the long-term evolution of the neutrino distribution function proceeds similarly with and without the oscillation term, though with measurable differences. We demonstrate that electron scattering, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung processes, and four-neutrino processes dominate flavor decoherence in the protoneutron star (PNS), absorption dominates near the shock, and all of the considered processes except elastic nucleon scattering and neutrino-neutrino processes are relevant in the decoupling region. Finally, we propose an effective decoherence opacity that at most energies predicts decoherence rates to within a factor of 10 in our model PNS and within 20% outside of the PNS., How neutrinos interact with the debris ejected from merging neutron stars determines how much matter escapes, how hot the matter is, and the relative amounts of neutrons and protons. This makes understanding neutrino irradiation of ejected matter a necessary part of interpreting recent and future observations of so-called ""kilonovae"" to determine whether neutron star mergers can be the origin of heavy elements in the universe. I will discuss a new Monte Carlo method for simulating neutrino transport in these highly relativistic, multi-dimensional environments. I will use this tool to estimate how well approximate transport methods capture the neutrino irradiation and propose improvements to approximate methods that will aid in accurate modeling and interpretation of kilonovae., , The mechanism driving core-collapse supernovae is sensitive to the interplay between matter and neutrino radiation. However, neutrino radiation transport is very difficult to simulate, and several radiation transport methods of varying levels of approximation are available. We carefully compare for the first time in multiple spatial dimensions the discrete ordinates (DO) code of Nagakura, Yamada, and Sumiyoshi and the Monte Carlo (MC) code Sedonu, under the assumptions of a static fluid background, flat spacetime, elastic scattering, and full special relativity. We find remarkably good agreement in all spectral, angular, and fluid interaction quantities, lending confidence to both methods. The DO method excels in determining the heating and cooling rates in the optically thick region. The MC method predicts sharper angular features due to the effectively infinite angular resolution, but struggles to drive down noise in quantities where subtractive cancellation is prevalent, such as the net gain in the protoneutron star and off-diagonal components of the Eddington tensor. We also find that errors in the angular moments of the distribution functions induced by neglecting velocity dependence are subdominant to those from limited momentum-space resolution. We briefly compare directly computed second angular moments to those predicted by popular algebraic two-moment closures, and we find that the errors from the approximate closures are comparable to the difference between the DO and MC methods. Included in this work is an improved Sedonu code, which now implements a fully special relativistic, time-independent version of the grid-agnostic MC random walk approximation., Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by axisymmetric rotating collapse, bounce, and early postbounce phases of a galactic core-collapse supernova are detectable by current-generation gravitational wave observatories. Since these GWs are emitted from the quadrupole-deformed nuclear-density core, they may encode information on the uncertain nuclear equation of state (EOS). We examine the effects of the nuclear EOS on GWs from rotating core collapse and carry out 1824 axisymmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations that cover a parameter space of 98 different rotation profiles and 18 different EOS. We show that the bounce GW signal is largely independent of the EOS and sensitive primarily to the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy, T /|W | , and at high rotation rates, to the degree of differential rotation. The GW frequency (f<SUB>peak</SUB>∼600 - 1000 Hz ) of postbounce core oscillations shows stronger EOS dependence that can be parametrized by the core's EOS-dependent dynamical frequency √{G ρ<SUB>¯ c</SUB> } . We find that the ratio of the peak frequency to the dynamical frequency f<SUB>peak</SUB>/√{G ρ<SUB>c</SUB> ¯ } follows a universal trend that is obeyed by all EOS and rotation profiles and that indicates that the nature of the core oscillations changes when the rotation rate exceeds the dynamical frequency. We find that differences in the treatments of low-density nonuniform nuclear matter, of the transition from nonuniform to uniform nuclear matter, and in the description of nuclear matter up to around twice saturation density can mildly affect the GW signal. More exotic, higher-density physics is not probed by GWs from rotating core collapse. We furthermore test the sensitivity of the GW signal to variations in the treatment of nuclear electron capture during collapse. We find that approximations and uncertainties in electron capture rates can lead to variations in the GW signal that are of comparable magnitude to those due to different nuclear EOS. This emphasizes the need for reliable experimental and/or theoretical nuclear electron capture rates and for self-consistent multidimensional neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of rotating core collapse., Neutrino interactions dominate the energetics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and determine the composition of the matter ejected from CCSNe and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Three dimensional (3D) CCSN and neutron star merger simulations are rapidly improving, but still suffer from approximate treatments of neutrino transport that cripple their reliability and realism. I use my relativistic time-independent Monte Carlo neutrino transport code SEDONU to evaluate the effectiveness of leakage, moment, and discrete ordinate schemes in the context of core-collapse supernovae. I also developed a relativistic extension to the Random Walk approximation that greatly accelerates convergence in diffusive regimes, making full-domain simulations possible. <P />Blue Waters Graduate Fellowship., We carry out axisymmetric simulations of rotating core-collapse, exploring over 92 precollapse rotational configurations and 18 different finite-temperature microphysical equations of state (EOS) using the general-relativistic hydrodynamical code CoCoNuT. Our focus is on gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that the GW wave signature depends systematically on the rotation rate of the inner core at bounce and the compactness of the protoneutron star (PNS), set by the EOS and rotation. The GW signal from core bounce is almost independent of the EOS. However, the frequency of the post-bounce ring down signal from the fundamental quadrupole oscillation mode of the PNS is dependent on both rotation and the EOS, increasing with rotation rate and compactness. We will discuss the origin of the EOS-dependent f-mode frequency variation and its potential observability with Advanced LIGO., We present Sedonu, a new open source, steady-state, special relativistic Monte Carlo (MC) neutrino transport code, available at bitbucket.org/srichers/sedonu. The code calculates the energy- and angle-dependent neutrino distribution function on fluid backgrounds of any number of spatial dimensions, calculates the rates of change of fluid internal energy and electron fraction, and solves for the equilibrium fluid temperature and electron fraction. We apply this method to snapshots from two-dimensional simulations of accretion disks left behind by binary neutron star mergers, varying the input physics and comparing to the results obtained with a leakage scheme for the cases of a central black hole and a central hypermassive neutron star. Neutrinos are guided away from the densest regions of the disk and escape preferentially around 45° from the equatorial plane. Neutrino heating is strengthened by MC transport a few scale heights above the disk midplane near the innermost stable circular orbit, potentially leading to a stronger neutrino-driven wind. Neutrino cooling in the dense midplane of the disk is stronger when using MC transport, leading to a globally higher cooling rate by a factor of a few and a larger leptonization rate by an order of magnitude. We calculate neutrino pair annihilation rates and estimate that an energy of 2.8 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg is deposited within 45° of the symmetry axis over 300 ms when a central BH is present. Similarly, 1.9 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg is deposited over 3 s when an HMNS sits at the center, but neither estimate is likely to be sufficient to drive a gamma-ray burst jet., The merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole are the prime candidate models for short-duration gamma ray bursts and production of r-process elements. Neutrinos can carry away energy and change the ratio of neutrons to protons, in turn affecting the appearance and dynamics of the burst and the types of elements formed from the outflow. We simulate Monte Carlo transport of neutrinos through the accretion disk surrounding the post-merger black hole and/or hypermassive neutron star to explore the influence of neutrinos on the disk composition and temperature profile, and discover faster thermal and composition evolution by a factor of a few when using Monte Carlo as opposed to neutrino leakage. Additionally, we demonstrate smaller (maximum 20%) differences when employing a simplified set of neutrino interactions commonly used in dynamical simulations., The merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole are the prime candidate models for short-duration gamma ray bursts and production of r-process elements. Neutrinos can carry away energy and change the ratio of neutrons to protons, in turn affecting the appearance and dynamics of the burst and the types of elements formed from the outflow. We simulate Monte Carlo transport of neutrinos through the accretion disk surrounding the post-merger black hole or hyper-massive neutron star to explore the influence of neutrinos on the disk composition and temperature profile., We present the first fully 3D general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of stellar collapse in rapidly rotating, magnetized progenitors using a microphysical equation of state and a Leakage neutrino transport approx imation. We perform simulations in 3D both with octant symmetry and with no imposed symmetries of the same 25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> progenitor. We show that in the simulation without symmetries a kink instability disrupts the initial formation of a jet, while octant symmetry allows the jet to stably propagate and leads to a jet-driven explosion. Rising magnetic bubbles expand the shock of the symmetry-free simulations at later times, but the star's ultimate fate is uncertain., We explore the qualitative and quantitative differences between supernova simulations with various neutrino transport approximation schemes. Post-bounce simulations are done in one dimension (with both Newtonian and general relativistic spacetimes) with a non-rotating 15 solar-mass progenitor and the nuclear equation of state with incompressibility 220 MeV of Lattimer &amp; Swesty (1991). We test the neutrino approximations of a simple lightbulb heating and analytic cooling scheme (Murphy &amp; Burrows 2008), the O'Connor &amp; Ott (2010) neutrino leakage scheme, and a two-moment transport scheme with analytic closure (O'Connor and Ott 2012). As it is the most simplistic, the MB method shows evidence of qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that are not present in the M1 scheme. At comparable neutrino luminosities, the simulations incorporating the MB method explode easily while the M1 runs do not. At the input neutrino luminosity suggested by Murphy &amp; Burrows (2008), the MB scheme results in much larger proto-neutron star radii than the M1 scheme. The leakage scheme agrees more closely with M1, though it predicts a smaller proto-neutron star radius, shock radius, and neutrino luminosity than M1.","['arXiv:2409.04405', '10.1103/PhysRevD.110.103019', '2024arXiv240904405R', '2024PhRvD.110j3019R', '10.48550/arXiv.2409.04405', '2024PhRvD.109l9902R', '10.1103/PhysRevD.109.129902', '2022arXiv220608444R', '2022PhRvD.106h3005R', '10.48550/arXiv.2206.08444', 'arXiv:2206.08444', '10.1103/PhysRevD.106.083005', 'arXiv:2205.06282', '2022arXiv220506282R', '10.1103/PhysRevD.106.043011', '10.48550/arXiv.2205.06282', '2022PhRvD.106d3011R', '2022arXiv220703561R', '10.48550/arXiv.2207.03561', 'arXiv:2207.03561', '2021arXiv210908631R', '2021PhRvD.104j3023R', '10.1103/PhysRevD.104.103023', 'arXiv:2109.08631', '10.48550/arXiv.2109.08631', '10.1103/PhysRevD.103.083013', '10.48550/arXiv.2101.02745', 'arXiv:2101.02745', '2021PhRvD.103h3013R', '2021arXiv210102745R', '2021APS..APRG09008R', '2020arXiv200909046R', '10.48550/arXiv.2009.09046', '10.1103/PhysRevD.102.083017', 'arXiv:2009.09046', '2020PhRvD.102h3017R', '2020zndo...3956882R', '10.5281/zenodo.3956882', '2019PhRvD..99l3014R', '2019arXiv190300022R', '10.1103/PhysRevD.99.123014', '10.48550/arXiv.1903.00022', 'arXiv:1903.00022', '2018AAS...23211006R', '2018PhDT........89R', '2017ApJ...847..133R', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa8bb2', '2017arXiv170606187R', 'arXiv:1706.06187', '10.48550/arXiv.1706.06187', '10.48550/arXiv.1701.02752', '10.1103/PhysRevD.95.063019', '2017PhRvD..95f3019R', '2017arXiv170102752R', 'arXiv:1701.02752', '2017APS..APR.U4003R', '2016APS..APRH15009R', '2015ApJ...813...38R', 'arXiv:1507.03606', '2015arXiv150703606R', '10.48550/arXiv.1507.03606', '10.1088/0004-637X/813/1/38', '2015IAUGA..2177826R', '2015APS..APRY14006R', '2014APS..APR.X8004R', '2013AAS...22121407R']","[('neutrino', 78), ('simulation', 36), ('flavor', 29), ('instability', 29), ('neutron', 29), ('star', 29), ('merger', 24), ('core', 21), ('transport', 21), ('supernova', 19)]","[(('neutron', 'star'), 25), (('core', 'collapse'), 15), (('star', 'merger'), 15), (('collapse', 'supernova'), 11), (('neutrino', 'transport'), 10), (('flavor', 'instability'), 9), (('monte', 'carlo'), 9), (('neutrino', 'flavor'), 8), (('fast', 'flavor'), 8), (('heavy', 'element'), 7)]","[(('neutron', 'star', 'mergers'), 12), (('core', 'collapse', 'supernovae'), 9), (('supernovae', 'neutron', 'star'), 6), (('fast', 'flavor', 'instability'), 6), (('collapse', 'supernovae', 'neutron'), 5), (('rotating', 'core', 'collapse'), 4), (('flavor', 'instability', 'ffi'), 3), (('neutron', 'star', 'merger'), 3), (('quantum', 'kinetic', 'equations'), 3), (('number', 'spatial', 'dimensions'), 3)]",Dirty

Using the {Romulus} cosmological simulations we examine the impact of environment on the occupation fraction of MBHs in low mass galaxies. Unlike most modern cosmological simulations, {Romulus} seeds MBHs based on local gas properties, selecting dense (n&gt;3 cm^-3, 15 times the threshold for star formation), pristine (Z&lt;3e-4 Zsol), and rapidly collapsing regions in the early Universe as sites to host MBHs without assuming anything about MBH occupation as a function of galaxy stellar mass, or halo mass, {}. The simulations predict that dwarf galaxies with M&lt;1e9 Msol in cluster environments are ~2 times more likely to host a MBH compared to those in the field. The predicted occupation fractions are remarkably consistent with those of nuclear star clusters. Across cluster and field environments, dwarf galaxies with earlier formation times are more likely to host a MBH. Thus, while the MBH occupation function is similar between cluster and field environments at high redshift (z&gt;3), a difference arises as late-forming dwarfs – which do not exist in the cluster environment – begin to dominate in the field and pull the MBH occupation fraction down for low mass galaxies. Additionally, prior to in-fall some cluster dwarfs are similar to progenitors of massive, isolated galaxies, indicating that they might have grown to higher masses had they not been impeded by the cluster environment. While the population of MBHs in dwarf galaxies is already widely understood to be important for understanding MBH formation, this work demonstrates that environmental dependence is important to consider as future observations search for low mass black holes in dwarf galaxies., , We study the origins of 122 ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Romulus C zoom-in cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster (M<SUB>200</SUB> = 1.15 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), one of the only such simulations capable of resolving the evolution and structure of dwarf galaxies (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We find broad agreement with observed cluster UDGs and predict that they are not separate from the overall cluster dwarf population. UDGs in cluster environments form primarily from dwarf galaxies that experienced early cluster in-fall and subsequent quenching due to ram pressure. The ensuing dimming of these dwarf galaxies due to passive stellar evolution results in a population of very low surface brightness galaxies that are otherwise typical dwarfs. UDGs and non-UDGs alike are affected by tidal interactions with the cluster potential. Tidal stripping of dark matter, as well as mass-loss from stellar evolution, results in the adiabatic expansion of stars, particularly in the lowest mass dwarfs. High-mass dwarf galaxies show signatures of tidal heating while low-mass dwarfs that survive until z = 0 typically have not experienced such impulsive interactions. There is little difference between UDGs and non-UDGs in terms of their dark matter haloes, stellar morphology, colours, and location within the cluster. In most respects cluster UDG and non-UDGs alike are similar to isolated dwarf galaxies, except for the fact that they are typically quenched., Using RomulusC, one of the only cosmological simulations of a galaxy cluster capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, we identify a population of galaxies matching properties of observed ultra-diffuse galaxies. We find that our simulated UDG population is in broad agreement with observations. UDGs in the simulation form primarily from the passive evolution of low mass galaxies quenched due to ram pressure stripping. There is little difference in the halo mass, spin, or galaxy colors of the UDG population compared to the ambient dwarf galaxy population, nor is there much difference in their evolution. UDGs tend to be larger than non-UDGs well before they fall into the cluster and have had their star formation quenched for longer (due to earlier infall)., We present the first results from ROMULUSC, the highest resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a galaxy cluster run to date. ROMULUSC, a zoom-in simulation of a halo with z = 0 mass 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, is run with the same sub-grid physics and resolution as ROMULUS25. With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, ROMULUSC represents a unique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments down to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that ROMULUSC results in an intracluster medium consistent with observations. The star formation history and stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with observations and abundance matching results, indicating that our sub-grid models, optimized only to reproduce observations of field dwarf and Milky Way mass galaxies, are able to produce reasonable galaxy masses and star formation histories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows that coexist with a low-entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member galaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or distance from the cluster centre. This enhanced quenched population extends beyond R<SUB>200</SUB> and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that an SMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG, but show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the brightest active galactic nucleus in the most massive galaxies., Current cosmological simulations have so far been limited to studying the formation of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in isolation, or with environmental effects applied artificially. Here I present the first self consistent prediction for the formation of UDGs in a galaxy cluster. With unprecedented resolution, the RomulusC cosmological simulation of a 1014 M⊙ galaxy cluster is uniquely able to resolve cluster member galaxies down to stellar masses of 107 M⊙ in halos as small as 3x109 M⊙, resulting in 77 resolved UDGs within 1.5 R200 at z = 0. I examine the relative influences of ram pressure stripping and tidal effects due to the environment on the formation of cluster UDGs, giving new insight into different UDG formation channels and their observable consequences., I present a self-consistent prediction for close Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) pair formation timescales following galaxy mergers. Using Romulus25, the first large-scale cosmological simulation to accurately track the orbital evolution of SMBHs within their host galaxies down to sub-kpc scales (Tremmel+ 2015, 2017, 2018), we predict that it is relatively rare for galaxy mergers to result in the formation of close SMBH pairs with sub-kpc separation and those that do form are often the result of Gyrs of orbital evolution following the galaxy merger. The likelihood and timescale to form a close SMBH pair depends on the mass and morphology of the merging galaxies. When galaxies are disrupted during a merger, their SMBHs are deposited on long lived, kpc-scale orbits resulting in a population of ‘wandering’ SMBHs. I discuss the implications of these results for predictions of SMBH merger rates, which have important consequences for the interpretation of future LISA observations. Finally, I examine the population of “wandering” SMBHs that we predict to exist in massive galaxies, like the Milky Way., We present a self-consistent prediction from a large-scale cosmological simulation for the population of “wandering” supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of mass greater than 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> on long-lived, kpc-scale orbits within Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We extract a sample of MW-mass halos from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, which is uniquely able to capture the orbital evolution of SMBHs during and following galaxy mergers. We predict that such halos, regardless of recent merger history or morphology, host an average of 5.1 ± 3.3 SMBHs, including their central black hole, within 10 kpc from the galactic center and an average of 12.2 ± 8.4 SMBHs total within their virial radius, not counting those in satellite halos. Wandering SMBHs exist within their host galaxies for several Gyr, often accreted by their host halo in the early Universe. We find, with &gt;4σ significance, that wandering SMBHs are preferentially found outside of galactic disks., We present the first self-consistent prediction for the distribution of formation time-scales for close supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs following galaxy mergers. Using ROMULUS25, the first large-scale cosmological simulation to accurately track the orbital evolution of SMBHs within their host galaxies down to sub-kpc scales, we predict an average formation rate density of close SMBH pairs of 0.013 cMpc<SUP>-3</SUP> Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We find that it is relatively rare for galaxy mergers to result in the formation of close SMBH pairs with sub-kpc separation and those that do form are often the result of Gyr of orbital evolution following the galaxy merger. The likelihood and time-scale to form a close SMBH pair depends strongly on the mass ratio of the merging galaxies, as well as the presence of dense stellar cores. Low stellar mass ratio mergers with galaxies that lack a dense stellar core are more likely to become tidally disrupted and deposit their SMBH at large radii without any stellar core to aid in their orbital decay, resulting in a population of long-lived `wandering' SMBHs. Conversely, SMBHs in galaxies that remain embedded within a stellar core form close pairs in much shorter time-scales on average. This time-scale is a crucial, though often ignored or very simplified, ingredient to models predicting SMBH mergers rates and the connection between SMBH and star formation activity., We present a novel implementation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation, dynamics and accretion in the massively parallel tree+SPH code, ChaNGa. This approach improves the modelling of SMBHs in fully cosmological simulations, allowing for a more detailed analysis of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution throughout cosmic time. Our scheme includes novel, physically motivated models for SMBH formation, dynamics and sinking timescales within galaxies and SMBH accretion of rotationally supported gas. The sub-grid parameters that regulate star formation (SF) and feedback from SMBHs and SNe are optimized against a comprehensive set of z = 0 galaxy scaling relations using a novel, multidimensional parameter search. We have incorporated our new SMBH implementation and parameter optimization into a new set of high-resolution, large-scale cosmological simulations called Romulus. We present initial results from our flagship simulation, Romulus25, showing that our SMBH model results in SF efficiency, SMBH masses and global SF and SMBH accretion histories at high redshift that are consistent with observations. We discuss the importance of SMBH physics in shaping the evolution of massive galaxies and show how SMBH feedback is much more effective at regulating SF compared to SNe feedback in this regime. Further, we show how each aspect of our SMBH model impacts this evolution compared to more common approaches. Finally, we present a science application of this scheme studying the properties and time evolution of an example dual active galactic nucleus system, highlighting how our approach allows simulations to better study galaxy interactions and SMBH mergers in the context of galaxy-BH co-evolution., , My thesis work has focused on improving the implementation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) physics in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. SMBHs are ubiquitous in mas- sive galaxies, as well as bulge-less galaxies and dwarfs, and are thought to be a critical component to massive galaxy evolution. Still, much is unknown about how SMBHs form, grow, and affect their host galaxies. Cosmological simulations are an invaluable tool for un- derstanding the formation of galaxies, self-consistently tracking their evolution with realistic merger and gas accretion histories. SMBHs are often modeled in these simulations (generally as a necessity to produce realistic massive galaxies), but their implementations are commonly simplified in ways that can limit what can be learned. Current and future observations are opening new windows into the lifecycle of SMBHs and their host galaxies, but require more detailed, physically motivated simulations. Within the novel framework I have developed, SMBHs 1) are seeded at early times without a priori assumptions of galaxy occupation, 2) grow in a way that accounts for the angular momentum of gas, and 3) experience realistic orbital evolution. I show how this model, properly tuned with a novel parameter optimiza- tion technique, results in realistic galaxies and SMBHs. Utilizing the unique ability of these simulations to capture the dynamical evolution of SMBHs, I present the first self-consistent prediction for the formation timescales of close SMBH pairs, precursors to SMBH binaries and merger events potentially detected by future gravitational wave experiments., We introduce a sub-grid force correction term to better model the dynamical friction experienced by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it orbits within its host galaxy. This new approach accurately follows an SMBH's orbital decay and drastically improves over commonly used `advection' methods. The force correction introduced here naturally scales with the force resolution of the simulation and converges as resolution is increased. In controlled experiments, we show how the orbital decay of the SMBH closely follows analytical predictions when particle masses are significantly smaller than that of the SMBH. In a cosmological simulation of the assembly of a small galaxy, we show how our method allows for realistic black hole orbits. This approach overcomes the limitations of the advection scheme, where black holes are rapidly and artificially pushed towards the halo centre and then forced to merge, regardless of their orbits. We find that SMBHs from merging dwarf galaxies can spend significant time away from the centre of the remnant galaxy. Improving the modelling of SMBH orbital decay will help in making robust predictions of the growth, detectability and merger rates of SMBHs, especially at low galaxy masses or at high redshift., Improving the diversity within the rapidly growing fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has become a forefront issue facing collegiate departments today. It is well known that there are large gaps in the participation and performance of minorities, women, and low-income students within these fields and that special attention must be paid in order to close this gap. Since 2005, the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) at the University of Washington (UW) Department of Astronomy has made a concentrated effort to recruit and retain underrepresented undergraduates in STEM, at which it has been very successful. Of course, recruiting these students can be a challenge, as is creating a curriculum and atmosphere that enables undergraduates to successfully participate in real astronomy research during their first or second year at a four-year college. Pre-MAP recruits a significant population of minorities and women into the program. The structure of the seminar is intended to not only provide necessary skills and experience, but also create a collaborative and supportive atmosphere among each cohort. I will discuss the recruitment practices of Pre-MAP as well as the structure of the seminar and how it addresses the goal of early participation and success in STEM research and course work.The intent of this talk is to share our methods so that more programs like Pre-MAP can be adopted successfully in other institutions., Cosmological simulations are an essential tool to understand the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, the limited resolution of these simulations presents unique challenges to successfully modeling black hole dynamics. We present a novel, physically motivated method for improving the dynamics of black holes in cosmological simulations, by accounting for the unresolved dynamical friction that SMBHs feel from stars and dark matter. We show how this approach, which naturally scales with resolution, is a major step forward compared to more commonly used 'advection' models that often assume SMBHs sink very rapidly toward the center of their host galaxies. Here, we demonstrate that our method is able to prevent numerical heating of SMBHs while allowing for realistic dynamics.Our implementation will allow us to more realistically model SMBH dynamics, accretion, and mergers in cosmological simulations, giving us the ability to better understand how SMBHs grow with their host galaxies. This also provides an opportunity for more detailed studies of SMBHs in dwarf galaxies, which can give crucial insight into constraining black hole seed formation models., Graduate students in the astronomy department at the University of Washington began the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) after recognizing that underrepresented students in STEM fields are not well retained after their transition from high school. Pre-MAP is a research and mentoring program that begins with a keystone seminar where they learn astronomical research techniques that they apply to research projects conducted in small groups. Students also receive one-on-one mentoring and peer support for the duration of the academic year and beyond. Successful Pre-MAP students have declared astronomy and physics majors, expanded their research projects beyond the fall quarter, presented posters at the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium, and received research fellowships and summer internships. Here we examine the success of the program in attracting underrepresented minorities and in facilitating better STEM retention and academic performance among incoming UW students. We use the University of Washington Student Database to study both the performance of Pre-MAP students and the overall UW student body over the past 8 years. We show that Pre-MAP students are generally more diverse than the overall UW population and also come in with a variety of different math backgrounds, which we show to be an important factor on STEM performance for the overall UW population. We find that that Pre-MAP students are both more academically successful and more likely to graduate in STEM fields than their UW peers, regardless of initial math placement., , Emission from X-ray binaries (XRBs) is a major component of the total X-ray luminosity of normal galaxies, so X-ray studies of high-redshift galaxies allow us to probe the formation and evolution of XRBs on very long timescales (~10 Gyr). In this paper, we present results from large-scale population synthesis models of binary populations in galaxies from z = 0 to ~20. We use as input into our modeling the Millennium II Cosmological Simulation and the updated semi-analytic galaxy catalog by Guo et al. to self-consistently account for the star formation history (SFH) and metallicity evolution of each galaxy. We run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known from previous studies to affect the evolution of XRBs. We use our models and observationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to create theoretical galaxy X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for several redshift bins. Models with low common envelope efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeper initial mass function exponent, and high stellar wind mass-loss rates best match observational results from Tzanavaris &amp; Georgantopoulos, though they significantly underproduce bright early-type and very bright (L<SUB>x</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>41</SUP>) late-type galaxies. These discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission and SFHs, active galactic nucleus contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed low-mass XRBs. In our highest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emission for most bright galaxies. We also find that the evolution of the normal galaxy X-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by XRBs in galaxies with X-ray luminosities between 10<SUP>40</SUP> and 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>., Emission from X-ray binaries (XRBs) is believed to be a major component to the X-ray luminosity of normal galaxies. We present results from large-scale XRB population synthesis models in galaxies from z=0 to z~20, using the Millennium II Cosmological Simulation and the semi-analytic galaxy catalog by Guo et al. (2011) to account for star formation history and metallicity evolution. We show that the evolution of the normal galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is driven by late-type galaxies at high luminosities (Lx &gt; 1e40 erg/s) and early-types at lower luminosities. We find that late-type galaxies dominate the overall X-ray emission at z&lt;2, which however has non-negligible contribution from low mass XRBs. Finally, we make predictions for high redshift galaxy X-ray number counts.","['2023arXiv230612813T', '2024OJAp....7E..26T', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.12813', 'arXiv:2306.12813', '10.33232/001c.116617', '10.3847/2041-8213/abeaaa', '2021ApJ...909L..30T', 'arXiv:1908.05684', '10.1093/mnras/staa2015', '2020MNRAS.tmp.2147T', '2020MNRAS.497.2786T', '2019arXiv190805684T', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.05684', '2020AAS...23531602T', 'arXiv:1806.01282', '2018arXiv180601282T', '10.1093/mnras/sty3336', '2018MNRAS.tmp.3171T', '2019MNRAS.483.3336T', '10.48550/arXiv.1806.01282', '2019AAS...23341604T', '2019AAS...23314110T', '2018ApJ...857L..22T', '10.3847/2041-8213/aabc0a', 'arXiv:1802.06783', '10.48550/arXiv.1802.06783', '2018arXiv180206783T', '2018MNRAS.tmp..160T', '2018MNRAS.475.4967T', '10.1093/mnras/sty139', 'arXiv:1708.07126', '10.48550/arXiv.1708.07126', '2017arXiv170807126T', '2016arXiv160702151T', 'arXiv:1607.02151', '10.48550/arXiv.1607.02151', '2017MNRAS.470.1121T', '10.1093/mnras/stx1160', '2017PhDT.......141T', '2017PhDT........75T', '10.1093/mnras/stv1060', '2015arXiv150107609T', 'arXiv:1501.07609', '2015MNRAS.451.1868T', '10.48550/arXiv.1501.07609', '2015AAS...22523302T', '2015AAS...22530507T', '2014AAS...22344802T', '2013mbhb.confE...8T', '2012arXiv1210.7185T', '10.1088/0004-637X/766/1/19', '2012arXiv1210.7185F', '10.48550/arXiv.1210.7185', 'arXiv:1210.7185', '2013ApJ...766...19T', '2012xrb..confE..58T']","[('galaxy', 94), ('mass', 39), ('smbh', 33), ('simulation', 32), ('smbhs', 31), ('evolution', 27), ('formation', 26), ('cluster', 26), ('dwarf', 23), ('cosmological', 21)]","[(('cosmological', 'simulation'), 19), (('black', 'hole'), 17), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 14), (('pre', 'map'), 10), (('low', 'mass'), 9), (('star', 'formation'), 9), (('host', 'galaxy'), 9), (('supermassive', 'black'), 8), (('smbh', 'pair'), 8), (('large', 'scale'), 7)]","[(('present', 'consistent', 'prediction'), 5), (('supermassive', 'black', 'hole'), 5), (('black', 'hole', 'smbh'), 5), (('low', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 4), (('large', 'scale', 'cosmological'), 4), (('smbhs', 'host', 'galaxies'), 4), (('close', 'smbh', 'pairs'), 4), (('pre', 'map', 'students'), 4), (('simulation', 'galaxy', 'cluster'), 3), (('star', 'formation', 'history'), 3)]",Dirty

Thus, any simulation of galaxy formation physics that seeks to capture the properties of massive galaxies should include a model for SMBH accretion and feedback. The details of how to implement such a model, however, are far from clear - we know the fundamental physics involved, but cannot possibly resolve it directly in our simulations, so we must invoke some ""sub-grid"" description of the behavior on larger scales. Simulators have a significant amount of flexibility in how they choose to describe the expected behavior, leading to an interpretability problem as the detailed effects on the simulated galaxy may depend on these modeling choices which are not rooted in fundamental physics. I will present a study of SMBH physics in FIRE zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation which explores this question from a different angle: given the large ""allowed parameter space"" of SMBH models, how do our modeling choices affect the outcome of the simulation and what are the common features of models which have outcomes matching known galaxy scaling relations? Our simulation suite includes ~500 runs with halo masses ranging from 10<SUP>10</SUP> - 10<SUP>13</SUP> Msun (i.e., from dwarf to massive galaxies) and a wide variety of models and parameterizations for SMBH accretion and feedback. I will describe several trends which emerge from this suite, including the connection between the growth of BH and stellar mass, the effect of changing accretion and feedback efficiencies, and how these outcomes depend upon halo mass, and I will show several ways that SMBH models can ""fail"" as well as several which can strike a complex series of balances to ""succeed"" across halo mass., Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is thought to be a primary driver of quenching in massive galaxies, but how to best implement SMBH physics into galaxy formation simulations remains ambiguous. As part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, we explore the effects of different modelling choices for SMBH accretion and feedback in a suite of ~500 cosmological zoom-in simulations across a wide range of halo mass (10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Within the suite, we vary the numerical schemes for BH accretion and feedback, accretion efficiency, and the strength of mechanical, radiative, and cosmic ray feedback independently. We then compare the outcomes to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find several models satisfying observational constraints for which the energetics in different feedback channels are physically plausible. Interestingly, cosmic rays accelerated by SMBHs play an important role in many plausible models. However, it is non-trivial to reproduce scaling relations across halo mass, and many model variations produce qualitatively incorrect results regardless of parameter choices. The growth of stellar and BH mass are closely related: for example, overmassive BHs tend to overquench galaxies. BH mass is most strongly affected by the choice of accretion efficiency in high-mass haloes, but by feedback efficiency in low-mass haloes. The amount of star formation suppression by SMBH feedback in low-mass haloes is determined primarily by the time-integrated feedback energy. For massive galaxies, the 'responsiveness' of a model (how quickly and powerfully the BH responds to gas available for accretion) is an additional important factor for quenching., Advances in instrumentation have recently extended detailed measurements of gas kinematics to large samples of high-redshift galaxies. Relative to most nearby, thin disc galaxies, in which gas rotation accurately traces the gravitational potential, the interstellar medium (ISM) of $z$ ≳ 1 galaxies is typically more dynamic and exhibits elevated turbulence. If not properly modelled, these effects can strongly bias dynamical mass measurements. We use high-resolution FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to analyse the physical effects that must be considered to correctly infer dynamical masses from gas kinematics. Our analysis covers a range of galaxy properties from low-redshift Milky-Way-mass galaxies to massive high-redshift galaxies (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> &gt; 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at $z$ = 1). Selecting only snapshots where a disc is present, we calculate the rotational profile $\bar{v}_\phi (r)$ of the cool ($10^{3.5}\,\lt {\it T}\lt 10^{4.5}~\rm {K}$) gas and compare it to the circular velocity $v_{\rm c}=\sqrt{GM_{\rm enc}/r}$. In the simulated galaxies, the gas rotation traces the circular velocity at intermediate radii, but the two quantities diverge significantly in the centre and in the outer disc. Our simulations appear to over-predict observed rotational velocities in the centres of massive galaxies (likely from a lack of black hole feedback), so we focus on larger radii. Gradients in the turbulent pressure at these radii can provide additional radial support and bias dynamical mass measurements low by up to 40 per cent. In both the interior and exterior, the gas' motion can be significantly non-circular due to e.g. bars, satellites, and inflows/outflows. We discuss the accuracy of commonly used analytic models for pressure gradients (or 'asymmetric drift') in the ISM of high-redshift galaxies., Galaxy populations at different cosmic epochs are often linked by cumulative comoving number density in observational studies. Many theoretical works, however, have shown that the cumulative number densities of tracked galaxy populations not only evolve in bulk, but also spread out over time. We present a method for linking progenitor and descendant galaxy populations which takes both of these effects into account. We define probability distribution functions that capture the evolution and dispersion of galaxy populations in number density space, and use these functions to assign galaxies at redshift z<SUB>f</SUB> probabilities of being progenitors/descendants of a galaxy population at another redshift z<SUB>0</SUB>. These probabilities are used as weights for calculating distributions of physical progenitor/descendant properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate or velocity dispersion. We demonstrate that this probabilistic method provides more accurate predictions for the evolution of physical properties than the assumption of either a constant number density or an evolving number density in a bin of fixed width by comparing predictions against galaxy populations directly tracked through a cosmological simulation. We find that the constant number density method performs least well at recovering galaxy properties, the evolving method density slightly better and the probabilistic method best of all. The improvement is present for predictions of stellar mass as well as inferred quantities such as star formation rate and velocity dispersion. We demonstrate that this method can also be applied robustly and easily to observational data, and provide a code package for doing so., Observations of the high-redshift universe have revealed a population of galaxies which are already very massive (~1e11 solar masses at z=2) and have typical sizes of &lt; 2 kpc, much smaller than their counterparts in the local universe. How such dense, massive galaxies form, and why they appear to be less common at low redshift, have been questions of interest for both theorists and observers. I will discuss these questions in the context of the Illustris simulation, a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation in which tens of thousands of galaxies form, evolve, and interact with each other, situated within a cosmological context. I select a group of massive compact galaxies at z=2 in the simulation and trace them back and forth in time to discover both how they formed at high redshift, and what they evolve into at the present day. I find a variety of both progenitors (compact galaxies form in the simulation either via central starbursts generally brought on by mergers, or by racing out to the tip of the SF main sequence and forming very early) and descendants (many formerly-compact galaxies lurk at the core of a more massive galaxy today, others were consumed in mergers, and some evolve passively and undisturbed). I will also discuss the implications of these results for observational methods of connecting galaxy populations across redshifts - in particular, the assumption of a constant cumulative comoving number density - and suggest an improvement to this method which takes the complexity and variety of galaxies' evolutionary paths into account., , Massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshift than today. The strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitor bias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed star formation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. Herein, we select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies (M<SUB>*</SUB> = 1-3 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, M<SUB>*</SUB>/R<SUP>1.5</SUP> &gt; 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>/kpc<SUP>1.5</SUP>) at z = 2 in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris and trace them forwards to z = 0 to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. By z = 0, the original factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. The dark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. The galaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex situ envelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third survive undisturbed and gain very little mass, 15 per cent are consumed in a merger with a more massive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers. The galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only ∼10 per cent remain compact by z = 0. The majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex situ mass. The most massive galaxies at z = 0 are the most likely to have compact progenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes a direct linkage to compact galaxies at z = 2. The compact galaxies' merger rates are influenced by their z = 2 environments, so that isolated or satellite compact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely to survive to the present day., Massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to be considerably more compact than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe. How these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined, though several progenitor populations have been proposed. Here we investigate the formation processes and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in Illustris, a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficiently large volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving the internal structure of galaxies. We select massive (∼10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and compact (stellar half-mass radius &lt;2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z = 2. Within the Illustris suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectly converged, but are reasonably reliable for our purposes. The resulting population is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also find several star-forming compact galaxies. The simulated compact galaxies are similar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. We follow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that there are multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by two mechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggered by gas-rich major mergers between z ∼ 2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radii by a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times when the universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so until z ∼ 2., Black hole binaries exhibit a wide range of variability phenomena, from large-scale state changes to broadband noise and quasi-periodic oscillations, but the physical nature of much of this variability is poorly understood. We examine the variability properties of three GRMHD simulations of thin accretion disks around black holes of varying spin, producing light curves and power spectra as would be seen by observers. We find that the simulated power spectra show a broad feature at high frequency, which increases in amplitude with the inclination of the observer. We show that this high-frequency feature is a product of the Doppler effect and that its location is a function of the mass and spin of the black hole. This Doppler feature demonstrates that power spectral properties of the accretion disk can be tied to, and potentially used to determine, physical properties of the black hole., We present extensive radio observations of the nearby Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) 2004cc, 2004dk, and 2004gq spanning Δt ≈ 8-1900 days after explosion. Using a dynamical model developed for synchrotron emission from a slightly decelerated shock wave, we estimate the velocity and energy of the fastest ejecta and the density profile of the circumstellar medium. The shock waves of all three supernovae are characterized by non-relativistic velocities of \overline{v}\approx (0.1{--}25)c and associated energies of E ≈ (2-10) × 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg, in line with the expectations for a typical homologous explosion. Smooth circumstellar density profiles are indicated by the early radio data and we estimate the progenitor mass-loss rates to be \dot{M}\approx (0.6{--}13)\times 10^{-5} \, M_{\odot }\, yr^{-1} (wind velocity, v<SUB>w</SUB> = 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). These estimates approach the saturation limit (\dot{M}\approx 10^{-4} \, M_{\odot }\, yr^{-1}) for line-driven winds from Wolf-Rayet stars, the favored progenitors of SNe Ibc including those associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Intriguingly, at later epochs all three supernovae show evidence for abrupt radio variability that we attribute to large density modulations (factor of ~3-6) at circumstellar radii of r ≈ (1-50) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm. If due to variable mass loss, these modulations are associated with progenitor activity on a timescale of ~10-100 years before explosion. We consider these results in the context of variable mass-loss mechanisms including wind clumping, metallicity-independent continuum-driven ejections, and binary-induced modulations. It may also be possible that the SN shock waves are dynamically interacting with wind termination shocks; however, this requires the environment to be highly pressurized and/or the progenitor to be rapidly rotating prior to explosion. The proximity of the density modulations to the explosion sites may suggest a synchronization between unusual progenitor mass loss and the SN explosion, reminiscent of Type IIn supernovae. This study underscores the utility of radio observations for tracing the final evolutionary stage(s) of SN progenitor systems., We present extensive radio observations of the nearby Type Ibc supernovae 2004cc, 2004gq, and 2004dk spanning Δ t≈ 8-1800 days after explosion. Using a dynamical model developed for synchrotron emission from a slightly decelerated blastwave, we estimate the velocity and energy of the fastest ejecta and the density profile of the circumstellar medium. The blastwaves for all three supernovae are characterized by non-relativistic velocities of v≈ (0.1-25)c and associated energies of E≈ (2-10)× 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg, in line with the expectations for a typical homologous explosion. Smooth, stellar wind density profiles are indicated by the early radio data and we estimate the progenitor mass loss rates to be ∘ M≈ (8-40)× 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (wind velocity, v<SUB>w</SUB>=103 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). These properties are consistent with those of Wolf-Rayet stars, the favored progenitors of SNe Ibc including those associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts. However, at late time, each of these SNe show evidence for abrupt radio variability which we attribute to significant circumstellar density modulations (factor of 5-100) at radii of R≈ (1-50)× 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm. For SN 2004gq, the density modulations are marginally consistent with the expectations for a variable and/or clumpy Wolf-Rayet line-driven wind. However, in the case of SNe 2004cc and 2004dk, the density modulations are more intense, ∘ M&gt;/ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and possibly attributed to continuum-driven winds or hydrodynamic eruptions. We compare the circumstellar environments for these three SNe with those of other Type Ibc supernovae and nearby gamma-ray bursts and find that they are characterized by a more violent progenitor mass loss history in the decades leading up to explosion.

Ardila reported an anomalous flux variation in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 43 light curve of the white dwarf HZ 4. We show that this flux variation was caused by the main-belt asteroid 4382 Stravinsky traversing the nearby TESS pixels, and it is therefore not a cause for concern regarding the continued use of HZ 4 as a photometric standard star., The asteroseismic radius determination previously reported for the pulsating helium-atmosphere white dwarf star KIC 08626021 is 6σ discrepant with constraints from Gaia astrometry. This calls into question the other results of the asteroseismic analysis, especially the high (central) oxygen abundance that stellar evolutionary models have been unable to reproduce., Pyriod provides basic period detection and fitting routines for astronomical time series. Written in Python and designed to be run interactively in a Jupyter notebook, it displays and allows the user to interact with time series data, fit frequency solutions, and save figures from the toolbar. It can display original or residuals time series, fold the time series on some frequency, add selected peaks from the periodogram to the model, and refine the fit by computing a least-squared fit of the model using Lmfit (ascl:1606.014)., TESS_PRF displays the TESS pixel response function (PRF) at any location on the detector. The package is primarily for estimating how the light from a point source is distributed given its position in a TESS Target Pixel File (TPF) or TESScut postage stamp. By default, it accesses the relevant PRF files on MAST, but can also reference files on a local directory. TESS_PRF assumes the PRF doesn't change considerably within a small TPF. The PRF model can be positioned by passing the relative row and column location within the TPF to the ""resample"" method. The pixel locations follow WCS convention, that an integer value corresponds to the center of a pixel., we use a CV-based strategy for detecting solar-like oscillations in red giants and measuring ν<SUB>max</SUB>. The following method is specifically designed for long-cadence Kepler light curves. It is validated by null results for dwarf stars with super-Nyquist ν<SUB>max</SUB>&gt;500μHz, and by our recovery of catalogued ν<SUB>max</SUB> values for the APOKASC giants. The second APOKASC catalogue (APOKASC-2; Pinsonneault et al. 2018ApJS..239...32P, Cat. J/ApJS/239/32) characterizes 6676 evolved stars with both Kepler light curves and APOGEE spectra (Pinsonneault et al. 2014ApJS..215...19P, Cat. J/ApJS/215/19). It includes ν<SUB>max</SUB> values combined from an ensemble of pipelines. We use these as a benchmark for evaluating the sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of our method of detecting ν<SUB>max</SUB> from CV spectra. Our ν<SUB>max</SUB> measurements from the CV spectra of the full sample of 6656 APOKASC-2 stars with KASOC data are tabulated in Table A1. We also catalogue the associated flags and emphasize that the vast majority of our ν<SUB>max</SUB> values are robust, even when accompanied by flags. <P />(1 data file)., The vast majority of main sequence stars host exoplanets, and the vast majority of stars conclude their evolution as roughly Earth-sized white dwarf stars; therefore, we expect the majority of white dwarfs to host exoplanets. Searching for exoplanet transits of white dwarfs requires different approaches than other areas of exoplanet research, since the compact stars in this case can be totally eclipsed by their larger planets. In this talk, I detail the observational properties of such transits and demonstrate that multiple transits of white dwarfs are likely buried in our current volume of ground-based survey photometry. I share my current approaches to uncovering these systems in public data from the Zwicky Transient Facility and confirming them with ground-based follow-up observations at Apache Point Observatory. Comparing the population of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs to their progenitor systems are needed to constrain theories of planetary migration during post-main-sequence evolution., Python has become the de facto standard programming language for astronomical research, with many open-source packages available for accessing, manipulating, and visualizing photometric time series data from Kepler, K2, and TESS. However, specialized tools for fitting frequency solutions to these time series have been conspicuously absent, causing many researchers to rely on closed-source legacy software, such as Period04. The interactive tutorial at <A href=""https://dirac.us/oil"">https://dirac.us/</A><A href=""https://dirac.us/oil"">oil</A> demonstrates the use of the new Pyriod package for the pre-whitening analysis of time series photometry of pulsating stars that fills this gap in the modern Python workflow for time domain stellar astrophysics. Pyriod can be used either interactively with Jupyter Notebook widgets, or through direct access to functions for automated analyses. It can also be easily extended by the user to provide additional functionality as desired., During its two-year prime mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is obtaining full-frame images with a regular 30-minute cadence in a sequence of 26 sectors that cover a combined 85% of the sky. While its primary science case is to discover new exoplanets transiting nearby stars, TESS data are superb for studying many types of stellar variability, with the number of publications using TESS data for other areas of astrophysics keeping pace with exoplanet papers. Following the conclusion of its prime mission in July 2020, TESS will revisit the sky in an extended mission that records full-frame images at a faster ten-minute cadence. In this note, I demonstrate that choosing a large submultiple of the original exposure times for the new cadence limits the synergy between prime and extended TESS mission data since both sampling rates produce many of the same Nyquist aliases. Adjusting the extended mission exposure time by as little as one second would largely resolve Nyquist ambiguities in the combined TESS data set., Pyriod provides similar functionality as the widely used Period04 software for the modern Python workflow, including a GUI for interactive analysis that works within Jupyter notebooks. All basic functionality is implemented, with more advanced features under development. Code and examples are available at github.com/keatonb/Pyriod/., Planetary materials orbiting white dwarf stars reveal the ultimate fate of the planets of the Solar System and all known transiting exoplanets. Observed metal pollution and infrared excesses from debris disks support that planetary systems or their remnants are common around white dwarf stars; however, these planets are difficult to detect since a very high orbital inclination angle is required for a small white dwarf to be transited, and these transits have very short (minute) durations. The low odds of catching individual transits could be overcome by a sufficiently wide and fast photometric survey. I demonstrate that, by obtaining over 100 million images of white dwarf stars with 30-second exposures in its first three years, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is likely to record the first exoplanetary transits of white dwarfs, as well as new systems of transiting, disintegrating planetesimals. In these proceedings, I describe my project strategy to discover these systems using the ZTF data., Context. Pulsation frequencies reveal the interior structures of white dwarf stars, shedding light on the properties of these compact objects that represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars. Two-minute cadence photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) records pulsation signatures from bright white dwarfs over the entire sky. <BR /> Aims: As part of a series of first-light papers from TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium Working Group 8, we aim to demonstrate the sensitivity of TESS data, by measuring pulsations of helium-atmosphere white dwarfs in the DBV instability strip, and what asteroseismic analysis of these measurements can reveal about their stellar structures. We present a case study of the pulsating DBV WD 0158-160 that was observed as TIC 257459955 with the two-minute cadence for 20.3 days in TESS Sector 3. <BR /> Methods: We measured the frequencies of variability of TIC 257459955 with an iterative periodogram and prewhitening procedure. The measured frequencies were compared to calculations from two sets of white dwarf models to constrain the stellar parameters: the fully evolutionary models from LPCODE and the structural models from WDEC. <BR /> Results: We detected and measured the frequencies of nine pulsation modes and eleven combination frequencies of WD 0158-160 to ∼0.01 μHz precision. Most, if not all, of the observed pulsations belong to an incomplete sequence of dipole (ℓ = 1) modes with a mean period spacing of 38.1 ± 1.0 s. The global best-fit seismic models from both LPCODE and WDEC have effective temperatures that are ≳3000 K hotter than archival spectroscopic values of 24 100-25 500 K; however, cooler secondary solutions are found that are consistent with both the spectroscopic effective temperature and distance constraints from Gaia astrometry. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the value of the TESS data for DBV white dwarf asteroseismology. The extent of the short-cadence photometry enables reliably accurate and extremely precise pulsation frequency measurements. Similar subsets of both the LPCODE and WDEC models show good agreement with these measurements, supporting that the asteroseismic interpretation of DBV observations from TESS is not dominated by the set of models used. However, given the sensitivity of the observed set of pulsation modes to the stellar structure, external constraints from spectroscopy and/or astrometry are needed to identify the best seismic solutions., , Detecting the presence and characteristic scale of a signal is a common problem in data analysis. We develop a fast statistical test of the null hypothesis that a Fourier-like power spectrum is consistent with noise. The null hypothesis is rejected where the local `coefficient of variation' (CV) - the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean - in a power spectrum deviates significantly from expectations for pure noise (CV ≈ 1.0 for a χ<SUP>2</SUP> 2-degrees-of-freedom distribution). This technique is of particular utility for detecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds, as it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected frequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the presence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are dominated by stellar granulation. This approach circumvents the need for background fitting to measure the frequency of maximum solar-like oscillation power, ν<SUB>max</SUB>. In this paper, we derive the basic method and demonstrate its ability to detect the pulsational power excesses from the well-studied APOKASC-2 sample of oscillating red giants observed by Kepler. We recover the catalogued ν<SUB>max</SUB> values with an average precision of 2.7 per cent for 99.4 per cent of the stars with 4 yr of Kepler photometry. Our method produces false positives for &lt; 1{{ per cent}} of dwarf stars with ν<SUB>max</SUB> well above the long-cadence Nyquist frequency. The algorithm also flags spectra that exhibit astrophysically interesting signals in addition to single solar-like oscillation power excesses, which we catalogue as part of our characterization of the Kepler light curves of APOKASC-2 targets., To extend LSST's coverage of the transient and variable sky down to minute timescales, we propose that observations of the Deep Drilling Fields are acquired in sequences of continuous exposures each lasting 2--4 hours. This will allow LSST to resolve rapid stellar variability such as short-period pulsations, exoplanet transits, ultracompact binary systems, and flare morphologies, while still achieving the desired co-added depths for the selected fields. The greater number of observations of each Deep Drilling Field pushes these mini-surveys deep in terms of both sensitivity to low-amplitude variability and co-added depth. Saving the individual 15-second exposures will yield an effective Nyquist limit of $\approx0.031$ Hz (32 seconds). Resolved short-period variability of targets in these fields will aid the interpretation of sparse observations of a greater number of variables in the main survey. If this cadence strategy conflicts with the science goals of individual Deep Drilling Fields, at least a subset of the additional observations of each field should be obtained continuously. This strategy should also be considered for the proposed Galactic Plane mini survey, which will observe a greater number of stellar variables and transients., Regular sampling in the time domain results in aliasing in the frequency domain that complicates the accurate determination of the periods of astrophysical variables. We propose to actively break the regularity of this sampling by providing an additional consideration for the scheduler that weights fields according to when observations will contribute the least to aliasing. The current aliases for each field can be computed during daytime from the history of observations. We can then calculate the times when additional observations would worsen or alleviate these aliases for different fields. The scheduler should give preference to observation epochs that lessen the effect of aliasing, while still meeting all other cadence requirements., Context. The nature of the recently identified ""sdA"" spectroscopic class of stars is not well understood. The thousands of known sdAs have H-dominated spectra, spectroscopic surface gravity values between main sequence stars and isolated white dwarfs, and effective temperatures below the lower limit for He-burning subdwarfs. Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution, whether extremely low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors or blue stragglers in the halo. <BR /> Aims: Stellar eigenfrequencies revealed through time series photometry of pulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural properties. The properties of pulsations exhibited by sdA stars would contribute substantially to our developing understanding of this class. <BR /> Methods: We extend our photometric campaign to discover pulsating extremely low-mass white dwarfs from the McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified from SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search for binary signatures from four new pulsators. <BR /> Results: Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations in 7. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 min to 12.3 h, with most on timescales of approximately one hour. We argue specific classifications for some of the new variables, identifying both compact and likely main sequence dwarf pulsators, along with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star. <BR /> Conclusions: With dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude, the pulsational evidence supports the emerging narrative that the sdA class consists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple types of sdA exhibit stellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe the precise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual subpopulations. <P />Light curves of seven new pulsating variable stars are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/617/A6"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/617/A6</A>, Stars are stretched by tidal interactions in tight binaries, and changes to their projected areas introduce photometric variations twice per orbit. Hermes et al. (2014, ApJ, 792, 39) utilized measurements of these ellipsoidal variations to constrain the radii of low-mass white dwarfs in eight single-lined spectroscopic binaries. We refine this method here, using Monte Carlo simulations to improve constraints on many orbital and stellar properties of binary systems that exhibit ellipsoidal variations. We analyze the recently discovered tidally distorted white dwarf binary system SDSS J1054-2121 in detail, and also revisit the Hermes et al. (2014) sample. Disagreements in some cases between the observations, ellipsoidal variation model, and Gaia radius constraints suggest that extrinsic errors are present, likely in the surface gravities determined through model atmosphere fits to stellar spectra., This work identifies seven new photometrically variable pulsating stars among the targets classified as ""sdA"" from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy. We provide the light curves of these new variables. All data we obtained with a Princeton Instruments ProEM camera on the McDonald Observatory 2.1-meter Otto Struve Telescope. Circular aperture photometry was measured for the targets and comparison stars with the IRAF script ccd_hsp (2002A&amp;A...389..896K). The target flux was divided by the mean comparison star flux and a low-order polynomial fit, and a barycentric correction was applied to the timestamps with the Wqed tools (2013ascl.soft04004T). These light curves are in the format output by Wqed, with headers defined in 2009JPhCS.172a2081T. <P />(3 data files)., With typical periods of the order of 10 minutes, the pulsation signatures of ZZ Ceti variables (pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf stars) are severely undersampled by long-cadence (29.42 minutes per exposure) K2 observations. Nyquist aliasing renders the intrinsic frequencies ambiguous, stifling precision asteroseismology. We report the discovery of two new ZZ Cetis in long-cadence K2 data: EPIC 210377280 and EPIC 220274129. Guided by three to four nights of follow-up, high-speed (≤slant 30 s) photometry from the McDonald Observatory, we recover accurate pulsation frequencies for K2 signals that reflected four to five times off the Nyquist with the full precision of over 70 days of monitoring (∼0.01 μHz). In turn, the K2 observations enable us to select the correct peaks from the alias structure of the ground-based signals caused by gaps in the observations. We identify at least seven independent pulsation modes in the light curves of each of these stars. For EPIC 220274129, we detect three complete sets of rotationally split {\ell }=1 (dipole mode) triplets, which we use to asteroseismically infer the stellar rotation period of 12.7 ± 1.3 hr. We also detect two sub-Nyquist K2 signals that are likely combination (difference) frequencies. We attribute our inability to match some of the K2 signals to the ground-based data to changes in pulsation amplitudes between epochs of observation. Model fits to SOAR spectroscopy place both EPIC 210377280 and EPIC 220274129 near the middle of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, with {T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>} =11590+/- 200 K and 11810 ± 210 K, and masses 0.57 ± 0.03 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.62 ± 0.03 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively., The Kepler and K2 missions have recently revolutionized the field of white dwarf asteroseismology. Since white dwarfs pulsate on timescales of order 10 minutes, we aim to observe these objects at K2’s short cadence (1 minute). Occasionally we find signatures of pulsations in white dwarf targets that were only observed by K2 at long cadence (30 minute). These signals suffer extreme aliasing since the intrinsic frequencies exceed the Nyquist sampling limit. We present our work to recover accurate frequency determinations for these targets, guided by a limited amount of supplementary, ground-based photometry from McDonald Observatory., Venus is quite hot / Stuff rises and breaks a lot / It sometimes bends though., Extensive observations from the Kepler spacecraft have recently revealed a new outburst phenomenon operating in cool pulsating DA (hydrogen atmosphere) <P />white dwarfs (DAVs). With the introduction of two new outbursting DAVs from K2 Fields 7 (EPIC 229228364) and 8 (EPIC 220453225) in these proceedings, <P />we presently know of six total members of this class of object. We present the observational commonalities of the outbursting DAVs: (1) outbursts that increase <P />the mean stellar flux by up to ≈15%, last many hours, and recur irregularly on timescales of days; (2) effective temperatures that locate them near the <P />cool edge of the DAV instability strip; and (3) rich pulsation spectra with modes that are observed to wander in amplitude/frequency., We assess the photometric variability of nine stars with spectroscopic T<SUB>eff</SUB> and log g values from the ELM Survey that locates them near the empirical extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf instability strip. We discover three new pulsating stars: SDSS J135512.34+195645.4, SDSS J173521.69+213440.6, and SDSS J213907.42+222708.9. However, these are among the few ELM Survey objects that do not show radial velocity (RV) variations that confirm the binary nature expected of helium-core white dwarfs. The dominant 4.31 hr pulsation in SDSS J135512.34+195645.4 far exceeds the theoretical cut-off for surface reflection in a white dwarf, and this target is likely a high-amplitude δ Scuti pulsator with an overestimated surface gravity. We estimate the probability to be less than 0.0008 that the lack of measured RV variations in four of eight other pulsating candidate ELM white dwarfs could be due to low orbital inclination. Two other targets exhibit variability as photometric binaries. Partial coverage of the 19.342 hr orbit of WD J030818.19+514011.5 reveals deep eclipses that imply a primary radius &gt;0.4 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>—too large to be consistent with an ELM white dwarf. The only object for which our time series photometry adds support to ELM white dwarf classification is SDSS J105435.78-212155.9, which has consistent signatures of Doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations. We conclude that the ELM Survey contains multiple false positives from another stellar population at T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≲ 9000 K, possibly related to the sdA stars recently reported from SDSS spectra., Data from the Kepler and K2 missions have captured the signatures of a new pulsation-related phenomenon in hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. Some pulsating white dwarfs within 500 K of the empirical cool edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip exhibit outburst-like brightness enhancements of up to 15% that last many hours and recur irregularly on timescales on days. In this thesis talk, I summarize the observational characteristics of this new outbursting class of ZZ Ceti., The unprecedented extent of coverage provided by Kepler observations recently revealed outbursts in two hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs (DAVs) that cause hours-long increases in the overall mean flux of up to 14%. We have identified two new outbursting pulsating white dwarfs in K2, bringing the total number of known outbursting white dwarfs to four. EPIC 211629697, with {T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>} = 10,780 ± 140 K and {log} g = 7.94 ± 0.08, shows outbursts recurring on average every 5.0 days, increasing the overall flux by up to 15%. EPIC 229227292, with {T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>} = 11,190 ± 170 K and {log} g = 8.02 ± 0.05, has outbursts that recur roughly every 2.4 days with amplitudes up to 9%. We establish that only the coolest pulsating white dwarfs within a small temperature range near the cool, red edge of the DAV instability strip exhibit these outbursts., , KIC 4552982 was the first ZZ Ceti (hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarf) identified to lie in the Kepler field, resulting in the longest pseudo-continuous light curve ever obtained for this type of variable star. In addition to the pulsations, this light curve exhibits stochastic episodes of brightness enhancement unlike any previously studied white dwarf phenomenon. We briefly highlight the basic outburst and pulsation properties in these proceedings., We present the Kepler light curve of KIC 4552982, the first ZZ Ceti (hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarf star) discovered in the Kepler field of view. Our data span more than 1.5 years, with a 86% duty cycle, making it the longest pseudo-continuous light curve ever recorded for a ZZ Ceti. This extensive data set provides the most complete coverage to date of amplitude and frequency variations in a cool ZZ Ceti. We detect 20 independent frequencies of variability in the data that we compare with asteroseismic models to demonstrate that this star has a mass {M}<SUB>*</SUB>\gt 0.6 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. We identify a rotationally split pulsation mode and derive a probable rotation period for this star of 17.47 ± 0.04 hr. In addition to pulsation signatures, the Kepler light curve exhibits sporadic, energetic outbursts that increase the star’s relative flux by 2%-17%, last 4-25 hr, and recur on an average timescale of 2.7 days. These are the first detections of a new dynamic white dwarf phenomenon that may be related to the pulsations of this relatively cool ({T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>} \=\10,860+/- 120 K) ZZ Ceti star near the red edge of the instability strip., We announce the discovery of the sixth-known pulsating extremely low-mass (ELM; ∼0.25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) white dwarf star (WD). SDSS J1618+3854 exhibits nonlinear pulse shapes that enable us to asteroseimically investigate the convective properties of ELM WDs for the first time. We present the light curve, its Fourier transform, and our very preliminary findings regarding convection., The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is projected to begin full science operations in 2023. It will photometrically observe roughly 13 million white dwarfs in the southern sky to a single-visit depth of r = 24.5, obtaining parallax, proper motion, and 6-filter color measurements. Perhaps most excitingly, LSST will revisit every field 1000 times over its 10-year operation, holding massive potential for variable white dwarf science. We highlight the beginning steps in our work to test LSST's sensitivity to constrain various aspects of pulsations throughout the multi-parameter color-space of every white dwarf instability regime. We anticipate detecting variability in tens of thousands of white dwarf pulsators through the survey lifetime., , Extremely low-mass (ELM; &lt; 0.25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) white dwarfs form from post-main sequence common envelope mass transfer, leaving them with helium cores and hydrogen atmospheres. As they cool, they pulsate in an extension of the DAV (hydrogen-atmosphere variable) instability strip as ELM white dwarf pulsators. We present a synopsis of all pulsating ELM white dwarfs known to date and highlight recent findings from our time-series analyses., We use ∼12,000 spectra of ∼3500 magnetically active M0-M9 dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey taken at 10-15 minute intervals, together with ∼300 spectra of ∼60 M0-M8 stars obtained hourly with the Hydra multiobject spectrometer, to probe Hα variability on timescales of minutes to weeks. With multiple observations for every star examined, we are able to characterize fluctuations in Hα emission as a function of activity strength and spectral type. Stars with greater magnetic activity (as quantified by L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>) are found to be less variable at all spectral types. We attribute this result to the stronger level of persistent emission in the high-activity stars, requiring a larger heating event in order to produce measurable variability. We also construct Hα structure functions to constrain the timescale of variability. The more active objects with lower variability exhibit a characteristic timescale longer than 1 hr, likely due to larger, longer lasting heating events, while the less active objects with higher variability have a characteristic timescale shorter than 15 minutes., The strength of Hα emission in magnetically active M dwarfs has been observed to increase on very short (seconds) timescales during flares, and to decrease on very long (millions-billions of years) timescales with stellar aging. We utilize a set of 13,000 time-resolved active M dwarf spectra taken on several-minute intervals from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and an independent set of 312 Hydra spectra taken hourly with the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope to study Hα variability on intermediate timescales. With several observations per target, and with many targets observed on multiple nights, we are able to probe variability in the equivalent width measurements of Hα on timescales from minutes to weeks. We will present the variability structure function and discuss it in the context of previous results., Galaxies have been historically classified based on their morphologies, requiring visual identification of their defining structural features. This can be extremely time consuming and especially difficult for galaxies that are poorly resolved or at certain orientations. To quell these issues, a new automated proxy for visual morphological classification is needed. We utilized photometric magnitudes and angular size information from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data releases to categorize galaxies at redshifts near z=0.1 as elliptical, lenticular, spiral, or irregular. A galaxy of interest has its catalog photometry corrected for redshift and is then compared to galaxies of known type from the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (RC3) by a chi-squared goodness-of-fit analysis of their spectral energy distributions, radial light concentrations, ellipticities, and UV-to-optical size ratios. Testing this method on the RC3 galaxies themselves yielded probabilities that each of the four outcomes result from each source type. Overall, results are drawn from the correct sources a majority of the time, at 52% for ellipticals, 45% for lenticulars, 61% for spirals, and 71% for irregular galaxies. These likelihoods held up when the method was tested on galaxies near the target z 0.1 redshift with rough classifications available from the COSMOS survey. Finally, the method was applied to numerous galaxies at z 0.1 with established star formation rates and stellar masses to reveal connections between these values and galactic type. Most notably, lenticular galaxies, while of comparable mass to ellipticals, were shown to be undergoing more current star formation, and irregular galaxies were observed to contain generally less stellar material than spirals.

optical effects of space weathering, as well as the properties of the surface that control optical changes, on asteroid (101955) Bennu. First, we set the stage by briefly reviewing what was known about space weathering of low-albedo materials from telescopic surveys, laboratory simulations, and sample return analysis. We then look at the evidence for the nature of space weathering on Bennu from recent spacecraft imaging and spectroscopy observations, including the visible to near-infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths, followed by other measurements such as normal albedo measurements from LIDAR scans. We synthesize these different lines of evidence in an effort to describe a general model of space weathering processes and resulting color effects on dark C-complex asteroids, with hypotheses that can be tested by analyzing samples returned by the mission. <P />A working hypothesis that synthesizes findings thus far is that the optical effects of maturation in the space environment depend on the level of hydration of the silicate/phyllosilicate substrate. Subsequent variations in color depend on surface processes and exposure age. On strongly hydrated Bennu, in color imaging data, very young craters are darker and redder than their surroundings (more positive spectral slope in the wavelength range 0.4-0.7 μm) as a result of their smaller particle sizes and/or fresh exposures of organics by impacts. Solar wind, dehydration, or migration of fines may cause intermediate-age surfaces to appear bluer than the very young craters. Exposed surfaces evolve toward Bennu's moderately blue global average spectral slope. However, in spectroscopic and LIDAR data, the equator, the oldest surface on Bennu, is darker and redder (wavelength range 0.55-2.0 μm) than average and has shallower absorption bands, possibly due to dehydration and/or nanophase and/or microphase opaque production. <P />Bennu is a rubble pile with an active surface, making age relationships, which are critical for determining space weathering signals, difficult to locate and quantify. Hence, the full story ultimately awaits analyses of the Bennu samples that will soon be delivered to Earth., The surface of Mars has been widely exposed to brines (S, Cl, Br; also P, Zn, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K, C, N, O, H), which include elements essential for life as we know it, providing the potential for widespread urable settings for an origin of life., A systems approach frames hypotheses for the earliest colonizer cells, which depart from ""minimalist"" cells, while consistent with prebiotic evolution., Ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique messengers to the distant universe, as gamma rays and cosmic rays do not arrive unattenuated or undeflected. A promising way to detect these UHE neutrinos is through the radio Cherenkov emission produced by neutrino-nucleon interactions in transparent media like ice. Several experiments are operating, under construction, or planning to observe neutrinos through this method, such as ARA, ARIANNA, RNO-G, and IceCube-Gen2. In this talk, we will discuss development of methods for reconstructing key properties of the neutrino interaction for in-situ neutrino detectors, including the vertex position and shower energy. These methods are based on simulations of a ``deep'' detector, with instrumentation deployed &gt;100m. Reconstruction of the signal polarization, which is also a key measurement, is considered in a separate contribution. <P />We thank the NSF for support through Grants AST 1903885 and PHY 1806923., The IceCube Neutrino Observatory opened the window on high-energy neutrino astronomy by confirming the existence of PeV astrophysical neutrinos and identifying the first compelling astrophysical neutrino source in the blazar TXS0506+056. Planning is underway to build an enlarged detector, IceCube-Gen2, which will extend measurements to higher energies, increase the rate of observed cosmic neutrinos and provide improved prospects for detecting fainter sources. IceCube-Gen2 is planned to have an extended in-ice optical array, a radio array at shallower depths for detecting ultra-high-energy (&gt;100 PeV) neutrinos, and a surface component studying cosmic rays. In this contribution, we will discuss the simulation of the in-ice optical component of the baseline design of the IceCube-Gen2 detector, which foresees the deployment of an additional ~120 new detection strings to the existing 86 in IceCube over ~7 Antarctic summer seasons. Motivated by the phased construction plan for IceCube-Gen2, we discuss how the reconstruction capabilities and sensitivities of the instrument are expected to progress throughout its deployment., The IceCube Neutrino Observatory opened the window on neutrino astronomy by discovering high-energy astrophysical neutrinos in 2013 and identifying the first compelling astrophysical neutrino source, the blazar TXS0506 + 056, in 2017. In this proceeding, we will discuss the science reach and ongoing development of the IceCube-Gen2 facility, which is the planned extension to IceCube. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the rate of observed cosmic neutrinos by an order of magnitude, be able to detect five-times fainter neutrino sources, and extend the measurement of astrophysical neutrinos several orders of magnitude higher in energy. We will discuss the envisioned design of the instrument, which will include an enlarged in-ice optical array, a surface array for the study of cosmic-rays, and a shallow radio array to detect ultra-high energy (&gt;100 PeV) neutrinos. We will also highlight ongoing efforts to develop and test new instrumentation for IceCube-Gen2., The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an experiment deployed at the South Pole to search for ultra-high energy (&gt; 10 PeV) neutrinos. ARA searches for neutrinos by burying clusters of antennas deep (200m) in the glacial ice, and looking for the radio emission produced by neutrino-nucleon interactions. In this talk, I will summarize the status of the experiment. I will discuss the latest results in the ARA search for neutrinos, which produced the best limit from an in-ice radio array above 100 PeV. I will also highlight ongoing work in analysis and reconstruction, and their implications for the design of next generation experiments. <P />NSF Grants 1903885, 2013134, 1806923, 2019597., Now that we know sulfate is everywhere on Mars, the presence of S-reducing chemoautotrophs using H2 should be tested. Obliquity cycling provides higher H2, warmer temps, and liquid H2O. Simulating this more clement climate can test for extant life., We provide an overview of the evidence for space weathering on asteroid (101955) Bennu, and summarize relevant findings from several ongoing parallel studies of surface processes and surface properties., The Viking missions were the only attempts to robotically detect extant life. Results were disappointing. Why? Based on better knowledge, in addition to biosignatures, future investigations, inducing activation of metabolism, should also be explored., In addition to assessing habitability for living organisms, the suitability of extraterrestrial environments for prebiotic evolution for the origin of life must be considered. Many habitable environments are anti-thetical to the origin of life., On the upcoming M2020 Mars rover and sample-return precursor mission, it will be important to select returnable samples not only of Jezero geologic units, but also samples for understanding fundamental processes that have been common on global Mars., The cometary nucleus emits aggregates that have differing compositional biases, as seen in mixed, silicate, and CHON particles and their subclasses., Crater lakes on Mars can create ancillary ponds that are candidate macrobionts, the settings under which prebiotic syntheses for the origin of life occur., Evidence for an absorber near 0.55 microns (iron oxide?) in the Bennu imaging data has sparked a search for supporting evidence in the spectrometer data., , Evidence indicates the composition of comets is variable with location. Data from the PIA instrument on Giotto are re-analyzed with respect to Stardust and Rosetta missions, to reveal associations between Na, O and C in cometary CHON particles., We report a detection of thermal emission from the hot Jupiter WASP-48b in the K<SUB>s</SUB>-band. We used the Wide-field Infra-red Camera on the 3.6-m Canada-France Hawaii Telescope to observe an occultation of the planet by its host star. From the resulting occultation lightcurve we find a planet-to-star contrast ratio in the K<SUB>s</SUB>-band of 0.136 ± 0.014%, in agreement with the value of 0.109 ± 0.027% previously determined. We fit the two K<SUB>s</SUB>-band occultation lightcurves simultaneously with occultation lightcurves in the H-band and the Spitzer 3.6- and 4.5-μm bandpasses, radial velocity data, and transit lightcurves. From this, we revise the system parameters and construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the dayside atmosphere. By comparing the SED with atmospheric models, we find that both models with and without a thermal inversion are consistent with the data. We find the planet's orbit to be consistent with circular (e &lt; 0.072 at 3σ). <P />Tables of light curve data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/615/A86"">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/615/A86</A>, We observed an occultation of WASP-48b on 2012 Aug 6 through the Ks (8302) filter with the Wide-field Infrared Camera (WIRCam) on the 3.6-m Canada-France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). <P />The table contains the twelve WASP-48b Ks-band occultation lightcurves shown in figure 3 of the paper. The aperture size and number of companion stars are noted in the first two columns. <P />The data are binned in intervals of 10 minutes. <P />(1 data file)., From orbital-based ""Mars Base Camp"" (MBC), the first human missions to Mars could teleoperate rovers and other assets with great enhancements in science., We present our analysis of the K2 short-cadence data of two previously known hot Jupiter exoplanets: WASP-55b and WASP-75b. The high precision of the K2 light curves enabled us to search for transit timing and duration variations, rotational modulation, starspots, phase-curve variations and additional transiting planets. We identified stellar variability in the WASP-75 light curve which may be an indication of rotational modulation, with an estimated period of 11.2 ± 1.5 days. We combined this with the spectroscopically measured v\sin ({i}<SUB>* </SUB>) to calculate a possible line of sight projected inclination angle of {i}<SUB>* </SUB>=41^\circ +/- 16^\circ . We also perform a global analysis of K2 and previously published data to refine the system parameters., The presentation will introduce science goals of the OSIRIS-REx mission and will focus on the spectral mapping components, namely the visualization of spectral measurements on the 3D map standard of the mission., The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultra-high energy (&gt;10<SUP>17</SUP> eV) neutrino detector in phased construction at the South Pole. The full detector will consist of 37 autonomous stations of antennas which search for the radio pulses produced by neutrino interactions in the Antarctic ice. Three of the proposed detectors have been installed at up to 200m depth, with an additional two slated for deployment in Austral summer 2017. A prototype of the detector was deployed in January 2011, in time to serendipitously observe the relatively active solar month of February. In this talk, we will present preliminary results from an analysis of radio waveforms associated with an X-class solar flare observed in this prototype station. These are the first reconstructable events of natural origin seen by ARA, and could potentially be a powerful calibration source for the array., Mars rover missions [Spirit (MER-A), Opportunity (MER-B), Curiosity (MSL)] have discovered unexpected geochemical extremes from aqueous alteration. Coatings and certain trace elements show large enrichment's well beyond magmatic differentiation., Our OSIRIS-REx space weathering map of asteroid 101955 Bennu will be an expression of the probability that each surface facet exhibits space weathering. To each surface facet, we will assign a ranking in: slope, band depth, albedo, and context., Martian soils and surface sediments will contain contributions from meteoritic (and IDP) input, with multiple important consequences. Determination of this input must interpret in situ measurements which focus on trace elements and evolved gases., A sentinel discovery by the first in situ measurements on Mars was the high sulfur and chlorine content of global-wide soils. A variety of circumstantial evidence led to the conclusion that soil S is in the form of sulfate, and the Cl is probably chloride. An early hypothesis states that these volatiles are emitted as gases from magmas, and quickly react with dust, soil, and exposed rocks. Subsequent determination that SNC meteorites are also samples of the martian crust revealed a significantly higher S content, as sulfide, than terrestrial igneous rocks but substantially less than in soils. The ensuing wet chemical analyses by the high-latitude Phoenix mission discovered not only chloride but also perchlorate and possibly chlorate. MSL data now also implicate perchlorate at low latitudes. Gaseous interactions may have produced amorphous material on grain surfaces without forming stoichiometric salts. Yet, when exposed to liquid water, Phoenix samples released electrolytes, indicating that the soils have not been leached by rain or fresh groundwater. Sulfate occurrences at many locations on Mars, as well as some chloride enrichments, have now been discovered by remote sensing, Landed missions have discovered Cl-enrichments and ferric, Mg, Ca and more complex sulfates as duricrust, subsurface soil horizons, sandstone evaporites, and rock coatings - most of which cannot be detected from orbit. Salt-forming volatiles affect habitability wherever they are in physical contact: physicochemical parameters (ionic strength, freezing point, water activity); S is an essential element for terrestrial organisms; perchlorate is an oxidant which can degrade some organics but also can be utilized as an energy source; the entire valence range of S-compounds has been exploited by diverse microbiota on Earth. Whether such salt-induced conditions are ""extremes"" of habitability depends on the relative abundance of liquid H2O., Geological samples cached by rovers and returned from the surface of Mars by a MSR mission will be fundamentally different from martian meteorites and must be isolated and given special treatment unlike any previous extraterrestrial materials., Evidence for aqueous alteration of igneous minerals on Mars can be gleaned from data on chemical composition, a capability that is critical for MER Opportunity rover exploration of Endeavour Crater and sample screening on the MSL rover Curiosity., Fracture fill composition in Esperance boxworks is consistent with montmorillonite + silica; a dark coating is rich in mafic sulfates; both potentially habitable., The existence of a global soil unit on Mars hinges on element profiles from five landers. Orbital and in situ data, including Phoenix, combine to explain the shortfall in Viking compositions, explicable as carbonate, H2O, and minor elements., , , , Rocks and sediments in Gusev crater, and especially Columbia Hills, reflect an exceptional geochemical diversity. Extreme variations in element concentrations are indicative, in many cases, of aqueous processes on Mars., During its exploration of the Columbia Hills, the Mars Exploration Rover ``Spirit'' encountered several similar samples that are distinctly different from Martian meteorites and known Gusev crater soils, rocks, and sediments. Occurring in a variety of contexts and locations, these ``Independence class'' samples are rough-textured, iron-poor (equivalent FeO ~ 4 wt%), have high Al/Si ratios, and often contain unexpectedly high concentrations of one or more minor or trace elements (including Cr, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Y). Apart from accessory minerals, the major component common to these samples has a compositional profile of major and minor elements which is similar to the smectite montmorillonite, implicating this mineral, or its compositional equivalent. Infrared thermal emission spectra do not indicate the presence of crystalline smectite. One of these samples was found spatially associated with a ferric sulfate-enriched soil horizon, possibly indicating a genetic relationship between these disparate types of materials. Compared to the nearby Wishstone and Watchtower class rocks, major aqueous alteration involving mineral dissolution and mobilization with consequent depletions of certain elements is implied for this setting and may be undetectable by remote sensing from orbit because of the small scale of the occurrences and obscuration by mantling with soil and dust., Martian soils with high content of compounds of sulfur and chlorine are ubiquitous on Mars, having been found at all five landing sites. Sulfate and chloride salts are implicated by a variety of evidence, but few conclusive specific identifications have been made. Discovery of jarosite and Mg-Ca sulfates in outcrops at Meridiani Planum (MER mission) and regional-scale beds of kieserite and gypsum (Mars Express mission) notwithstanding, the sulfates in soils are uncertain. Chlorides or other Cl-containing minerals have not been uniquely identified directly by any method. Viking and Pathfinder missions found trends in the elemental analytical data consistent with MgSO4, but Viking results are biased by duricrust samples and Pathfinder by soil contamination of rock surfaces. The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) missions have taken extensive data on soils with no confirmation of trends implicating any particular cation. In our model of martian dust and soil, the S and Cl are initially incorporated by condensation or chemisorption on grains directly from gas phase molecules in the atmosphere. It is shown by modeling that the coatings thus formed cannot quantitatively explain the apparent elemental composition of these materials, and therefore involve the migration of ions and formation of microscopic weathering rinds. Original cation inventories of unweathered particles are isochemically conserved. Exposed rock surfaces should also have micro rinds, depending upon the length of time of exposure. Martian soils may therefore have unusual chemical properties when interacting with aqueous layers or infused fluids. Potential ramifications to the quantitative accuracy of x-ray fluorescence and Moessbauer spectroscopy on unprocessed samples are also assessed., , The MER Opportunity Rover has measured additional outcrop at Meridiani Planum, including the most sulfate-rich sample to date. A single basaltic source material reacted with SO3-rich acid brine may account for the observed chemistries., The elements P, Ti and Y are enriched in certain samples in Columbia Hills, Gusev crater, Mars. Similarly, the elements Ni and Cr are lower than typical. This overall signature also occurs in the igneous martian meteorites QUE 94201, EETA79001-B, and Los Angeles., Drawing upon analogs from the rocky planets with geological features, subsurface acquifers and magmatism, the range of surface manifestations of a subsurface ocean on Titan comprise a series of models. Cryovolcanism of aqueous eutectics will produce flows which may be detectable as sporadic outcrops from the hydrocarbon-rich regolith, exhumed by aeolian and/or fluid processes. Solidification of extruded cryomagma, especially if containing a significant water component, should exhibit fractional crystallization of solutes in late-freeze ponds and flow fronts. Abundant higher- Z elements such as Si, S and Fe, as influenced by the Eh-pH field of the liquid phase, might be in evidence, demonstrating communication among the principal mantle components of such bodies. Consequent availability of potential nutrients and chemical energy sources would be a key indicator for habitability by chemoautolithotrophs on Titan. With near-surface mobility and sensing, LIBS as well as active and passive IR mapping spectrometry are all possible in the environment of Titan's lower atmosphere. Although some remote measurements are infeasible because of the atmosphere, near- surface naturally radioactive rock-forming elements such as K, U, and Th could be detected with gamma ray spectrometry. Touch-and-go techniques developed for small- body sampling can provide material for onboard GC, MS, XRD, microscopy and other miniaturized analytical techniques. Surface dwell times of minutes would enable contact XRF with detection of critical element ratio's such as S/Cl, K/Ca, and Mg/Si/Fe, and Raman spectroscopy for organic and mineralogical analysis, . Longer contact times would permit electromagnetic depth sounding. Many IR and particle- detection sensors operate ideally at or near the low temperatures intrinsic to the Titan atmosphere, simplifying those aspects of instrument development. Exploration of Titan by in situ and mobility techniques would capitalize on the investments and lessons- learned from the robotic exploration of Mars and other planetary bodies., The STEP Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle accelerometer sensitivity is achieved using a SQUID-based superconducting circuit with features that enhance sensitivity to differential motion of two test masses The recent success of SQUID measurement systems on GPB demonstrates that SQUID noise performance on the ground can be used during integrated testing to validate on-orbit performance We will present the first measurements of SQUID noise and displacement sensitivity for a brass-board accelerometer with the fidelity to validate the STEP baseline design We will also discuss our expectations for the performance of an engineering model accelerometer that is currently under manufacture, During exploration of Columbia Hills at Gusev crater, the Spirit rover of the MER mission has discovered several separate occurrences of material with a unique elemental signature. As measured by x-ray fluorescence emission using the APXS instrument, these samples stand out for their low Fe content, accompanied by corresponding increases in Al and Si but without high concentrations of mineralogically important cations such as Ca, Mg, Na, or K. No previous martian samples, from five landed missions and numerous martian meteorites, have such low iron content. Chemical trends implicate Mg sulfates and Ca phosphates are important but minor accessory minerals. Moessbauer analysis indicates some or all Ti to be present as ilmenite. The remaining component has high Al and Si abundances in proportions within the range of classical montmorillonite compositions found at various locations on Earth, including their correspondingly low concentrations of major cations. Typically the result of weathering of basaltic ash and often associated with more arid environments, the formation of montmorillonite or its alteration-product precursor implies that significant aqueous activity to facilitate geochemical separations occurred. In addition, various of these samples contain trace element anomalies that are unique for martian materials, including enrichments in Cu, Ni, Y, Ga, Cr, and possibly Pb, Co, Sr, and Zn. Adsorption by high cation exchange minerals such as montmorillonite clays or other alteration materials (allophane, silica, imogolite) often bear similar fingerprints due to their high-area charged surfaces which confer affinities for multivalent metal ions in solution. Samples of this ""Independence Class"" of materials have been found at three separated sites in the upper portion of Husband Hill. The samples are disparate in form, including clods (or peds), an outcrop, and a ""rock"". Their lighter color and rugged morphology are a common feature. The latter may indicate susceptibility to fragmentation, with possible derivation from a deeper-lying layer of source material., The science and technological issues presented at this workshop in honor of Bill Erickson's 74<SUP>th</SUP> birthday, are certainly opening up a new window of astronomical observations at the low end of the radio frequency spectrum. We briefly review some of the contributions concentrating our comments on the topics of science, technology, and history., Analyses of outcrops created by the impact craters Endurance, Fram and Eagle reveal the broad lateral continuity of chemical sediments at the Meridiani Planum exploration site on Mars. Approximately ten mineralogical components are implied in these salt-rich silicic sediments, from measurements by instruments on the Opportunity rover. Compositional trends in an apparently intact vertical stratigraphic sequence at the Karatepe West ingress point at Endurance crater are consistent with non-uniform deposition or with subsequent migration of mobile salt components, dominated by sulfates of magnesium. Striking variations in Cl and enrichments of Br, combined with diversity in sulfate species, provide further evidence of episodes during which temperatures, pH, and water to rock ratios underwent significant change. To first order, the sedimentary sequence examined to date is consistent with a uniform reference composition, modified by movement of major sulfates upward and of minor chlorides downward. This reference composition has similarities to martian soils, supplemented by sulfate anion and the alteration products of mafic igneous minerals. Lesser cementation in lower stratigraphic units is reflected in decreased energies for grinding with the Rock Abrasion Tool. Survival of soluble salts in exposed outcrop is most easily explained by absence of episodes of liquid H <SUB>2</SUB>O in this region since the time of crater formation., , Outcrops of salt-rich silicic sediments at Meridiani Planum were analyzed using sample preparation via grinding to reveal rock interiors. X-ray fluorescence and Moessbauer analysis are combined with IR spectroscopy to infer mineral composition., The unpredicted heterogeneity in particle number density in the coma of Wild 2 is consistent with delayed fragmentation to produce small particles from larger aggregates initially ejected from the cometary nucleus. The resultant heterogeneous inner coma results in stochastic variations in particle number and size distribution. Fragmentation can be accelerated after aggregate release by enhanced heating and one or more additional factors such as abrupt depressurization, phase transitions, exothermic chemical reactions, centrifugal forces, and electrostatic repulsion. Certain predicted characteristics of such in-flight disaggregation in coma particle streams correspond to known cometary phenomena., Infrared observations (0.8-2.5 μm) of 42 asteroids in the X complex are presented. Previous studies of these asteroids and their taxonomic classes are summarized using both the Tholen and the Bus-Binzel taxonomic systems. With this study we seek to extend our compositional information about X-complex asteroids in order to refine our knowledge of the geologic structure of the asteroid regions. Our results suggest that there may be a type of material among X-complex objects that is not related to E-, M-, or P-type object material. This, in turn, suggests that albedo should not be the only criterion for a mineralogy-based subclassification of X-complex objects., The Seven-color Asteroid Survey (SCAS) consists of photometry in seven filters from 0.9 to 2.3 microns, of a total of 126 asteroids of types S, K, and M., Detections of salt-forming elements at previous landing sites have been extended in multiple examples for soils, outcrops, and light and dark rocks at the Meridiani Planum and Gusev Crater rover sites. A general theme of widespread S and Cl and now even Br occurrences is emerging for the planet. Mars Exploration Rover (MER) surface explorations and Mars Express orbital measurements are discovering exposures of very high sulfate concentrations in certain locations. Implicated cations for sulfates include Mg, Ca and Fe. Odyssey observations from orbit show planet-wide abundances of Cl, albeit with intriguing variations. These abundances and their patterns reinforce the evidence for mobilization of soluble salts under aqueous influence, but likewise place significant constraints on the volumes and nature of the interactions of various hydrologic forms of liquid water in the history of the observable martian surface. Physicochemical conditions of diverse weathering regimes may have affected the formation and most certainly the redistribution and diagenetic modification of salt deposits on Mars. Supplementing the abundant geomorphologic evidence for episodic activity by H2O, salt concentrations provide direct evidence for standing bodies of liquid H2O. Future detailed characterization of such salt deposits could establish temperature and saline concentration parameters at times of deposition or alteration, and hence clarify the climate regimes for corresponding times in martian history. Funding support for MER science and mission operations is provided by NASA/JPL., , An improved form of De La Rue's photoheliograph built by Dallmeyer was installed at Melbourne Observatory in time to observe the 1874 transit of Venus. Photographs obtained included some made with De La Rue's version of Janssen's rapid sequence photographic camera. A succession of adverse circumstances has led to the preservation of the photoheliograph at Melbourne, unaltered from its nineteenth century form. It is expected to be usable again in its original domes building for the 2004 transit of Venus., It is modeled that a significant component of the jets of some comets are released as aggregate clumps, which then fragment and shed particles after release, leading to a heterogeneous innermost coma., Spectral data are used in conjunction with a physical model developed from lightcurves and radar images to investigate compositional and textural properties on the near surface of asteroid 2100 Ra Shalom as a function of rotation phase., The Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM) mission proposes to fly through the upper atmosphere of Mars at hypervelocity to collect airborne dust and gas, and return the material to Earth for detailed analysis in a variety of specialized and sophisticated laboratories. SCIM would accomplish the first low-cost return of martian material, and could provide crucial insights into the poorly understood history of water and weathering processes on Mars. Planetary protection forward contamination can be satisfied by straight-forward, established procedures. The more challenging concern for back-contamination of Earth has been directly addressed through a number of detailed engineering analyses to identify which portions of the spacecraft are susceptible to contamination by surviving organisms, combined with in-space heating to sterilize the aerogel collecting medium after acquisition of samples. Systems for ""breaking-the-chain"" of back contamination have been designed. Review of established heat sterilization procedures on Earth have provided a rationale for specifying a conservative temperature-time cycle for sterilization onboard the spacecraft. In-flight monitoring of onborad systems will provide the Planetary Protection Office with confirmatory information needed to enable approval for final re-targeting of the trajectory to return to Earth., Through a variety of mechanisms, aggregates of fine particles may be ejected as discrete clumps in streams from cometary nuclei. Breakup of these clumps during transport to the outer coma results in inhomogeneous, spatially confined plumes of particulates of mixed sizes. Geometrical collimation or supersonic flow may be unnecessary as mechanisms for creating narrow jets apparent during flyby's of comets Halley, Borrelly and Wild 2. Released aggregates would quickly become exposed to strong solar heating and may also experience a sudden lowering in ambient gas pressure. As the material moves toward the outer coma, either or both mechanisms can promote rapid disaggregation via fission, particle shedding, and/or explosive disintegration. Evidence for the proposed mechanism includes: radar observations of large particle swarms near cometary nuclei; o","['2024icrc.confE1149C', '2024PoS...444E1149C', '10.1016/j.icarus.2023.115563', '2023Icar..40015563C', '2023LPICo2689.2001C', '2023LPICo2806.1043C', '2022APS..APRY09001C', '2022icrc.confE1186C', 'arXiv:2107.08500', '2022PoS...395E1186C', '10.22323/1.395.1186', '10.48550/arXiv.2107.08500', '2021arXiv210708500C', '10.48550/arXiv.2108.05292', '10.1088/1748-0221/16/10/C10007', '2021arXiv210805292C', '2021arXiv210805292B', '2021JInst..16C0007C', 'arXiv:2108.05292', '2021APS..APRT18007C', '2019LPICo2108.5008C', '2019LPICo2189.2125C', '2019LPICo2108.5007C', '2019LPICo2134.1006C', '2019LPICo2089.6124C', '2019LPI....50.1302C', '2019LPI....50.1300C', '2019LPI....50.3278C', '2019PhDT.......152C', '2018LPICo2067.6167C', '2018arXiv180401913C', '10.1051/0004-6361/201527071', '10.48550/arXiv.1804.01913', '2018A&A...615A..86C', 'arXiv:1804.01913', '10.26093/cds/vizier.36150086', '2018yCat..36150086C', '2018LPI....49.1189C', '10.48550/arXiv.1802.02132', '10.1088/1538-3873/aaa33e', '2018arXiv180202132C', '2018PASP..130c4401C', 'arXiv:1802.02132', '2017EPSC...11..984C', '2017APS..APR.Y3002C', '2016LPICo1921.6079C', '2015LPICo1878.2036C', '2015LPICo1856.5044C', '2014AGUFM.P23E..05C', '2014LPICo1800.5049C', '2014LPICo1791.1094C', '2014LPI....45.1419C', '2010LPI....41.1419C', '2008LPICo1401...21C', '2008LPICo1405.8304C', '2008LPICo1405.8131C', '2007LPICo1353.3232C', '2007JGRE..11206S01C', '10.1029/2006JE002756', '2007JGRE..112.6S01C', '2006AGUFM.P43A..04C', '2006LPICo1331...28C', '2006msra.work...28C', '2006LPI....37.1711C', '2006LPI....37.1509C', '2006epsc.conf..290C', '2006cosp.meet.3459C', '2006cosp...36.3459C', '2005AGUFM.P12A..04C', '2005ASPC..345..533C', '10.1016/j.epsl.2005.09.040', '2005E&PSL.240...73C', '2005LPICo1280...32C', '2005LPI....36.1446C', '2004JGRE..10912S03C', '10.1029/2004JE002319', '10.1086/424856', '2004AJ....128.3070C', '2004PDSS...21.....C', '2004DPS....36.2702C', '2004BAAS...36.1129C', '2004emge.conf.8075C', '2004JAHH....7...44C', '2004LPI....35.1801C', '2004LPI....35.1120C', '2004cosp...35..555C', '2004cosp.meet..555C', '2004cosp.meet..554C', '2004cosp...35..554C', '2003cdap.work.6005C', '2003mars.conf.3106C', '2003DPS....35.2205C', '2003BAAS...35..955C', '2003LPI....34.1797C', '2003raf..conf....1C', '2003ASPC..300....1C']","[('mar', 29), ('sample', 28), ('surface', 27), ('neutrino', 26), ('mission', 20), ('high', 20), ('material', 19), ('data', 19), ('soil', 19), ('type', 19)]","[(('space', 'weathering'), 8), (('icecube', 'gen'), 8), (('high', 'energy'), 7), (('ultra', 'high'), 5), (('astrophysical', 'neutrino'), 5), (('radio', 'array'), 5), (('gusev', 'crater'), 5), (('meridiani', 'planum'), 5), (('surface', 'mar'), 4), (('mg', 'ca'), 4)]","[(('ultra', 'high', 'energy'), 5), (('http', 'cdsarc', 'strasbg'), 4), (('cdsarc', 'strasbg', 'fr'), 4), (('high', 'energy', 'pev'), 3), (('energy', 'pev', 'neutrinos'), 3), (('emission', 'produced', 'neutrino'), 2), (('produced', 'neutrino', 'nucleon'), 2), (('neutrino', 'nucleon', 'interactions'), 2), (('icecube', 'neutrino', 'observatory'), 2), (('neutrino', 'observatory', 'opened'), 2)]",Dirty

See Section 2.2. <P />The High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck I telescope has a rich history of making stable RV measurements of exoplanet host stars over decades long timescales. We made use of this facility's ability and achieved RV baselines ranging from a few years to a decade for all of our systems.

See Section 2.5. <P />(3 data files)., Discovering and characterizing exoplanets at the outer edge of the transit method's sensitivity has proven challenging owing to geometric biases and the practical difficulties associated with acquiring long observational baselines. Nonetheless, a sample of giant exoplanets on orbits longer than 100 days has been identified by transit hunting missions. We present long-term Doppler spectroscopy for 11 such systems with observation baselines spanning a few years to a decade. We model these radial velocity observations jointly with transit photometry to provide initial characterizations of these objects and the systems in which they exist. Specifically, we make new precise mass measurements for four long-period giant exoplanets (Kepler-111 c, Kepler-553 c, Kepler-849 b, and PH-2 b), we place new upper limits on mass for four others (Kepler-421 b, KOI-1431.01, Kepler-1513 b, and Kepler-952 b), and we show that several confirmed planets are in fact not planetary at all. We present these findings to complement similar efforts focused on closer-in short-period giant planets, and with the hope of inspiring future dedicated studies of cool giant exoplanets., According to the core accretion theory of giant planet formation, runaway gas accretion occurs after a heavy element core reaches a critical mass, typically estimated to be on the order of 10 Earth masses. However, interior structure models have suggested that many giant exoplanets with known masses and radii contain far more than 10 Earth masses of heavy elements. This has called into question the fundamental concepts of how and when giant planets accrete gas and heavier materials. Differences in stellar and disk properties, and the stochastic nature of planet formation, further convolute the processes at play. Here, we present Kepler-511: a curious exoplanet system containing two giant planets, one that experienced runaway gas accretion (planet b) and one that did not (planet c). Both planets have relatively long orbital periods given their transiting geometry (b: 297 days, c: 26.6 days). With an 8.5-year Doppler spectroscopy survey, we have measured the mass of both planets. The planets' different formation pathways were clear once we combined their masses and radii to infer bulk metallicities, which show that the inner planet is composed of 90% heavy elements, amounting to near 30 Earth masses. Interestingly, we find that it is unlikely that either planet experienced significant gas loss due to tidal energy deposition or stellar irradiation. We will discuss the properties of these planets and their (surprisingly) metal poor host star and present possible explanations for how they formed so differently alongside each other. A system of multiple well characterized, cool giant planets like Kepler-511 is a novel and valuable testbed for theories of giant planet formation., Amateur astronomers have the incredible potential to support professional scientific investigations through the contribution of observational data and analysis. The emerging telescope maker, Unistellar, is altering the landscape of citizen science and public engagement in science through the development of the Enhanced Vision Telescope (eVscope), a compact mass-market device capable of acquiring astronomical data. The eVscope is an 11.4 cm aperture telescope designed specifically to work in both urban and countryside environments. At present, almost 10,000 eVscopes are in use, spread across every continent except Antarctica. This includes several dozen community colleges in the United States that received an eVscope as part of our Unistellar College Astronomy Network. The sheer multitude of eVscopes and their latitudinal and longitudinal coverage over the Earth make them an exciting tool for the community to contribute to the forefront of research in astronomy. Here, we will describe the main citizen science cases in astronomy currently being pursued by the Unistellar Network: exoplanet transits, transient events, and planetary defense and situational awareness. We will briefly summarize the thousands of observations that have been submitted by citizen scientists to date. These scientific campaigns comprise a productive and data-rich outreach program that is engaging an active community of amateur astronomers in a new and exciting way., , The union of the transit and radial velocity (RV) techniques, each of which measures a key exoplanet observable, has strongly guided the early development of exoplanet science. However, the short-period selection bias of the transit method has left a dearth of well characterized exoplanets at wider separations that limits tests of planetary formation and structure theories. We will discuss results from the ongoing Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT'EM) survey, which confronts the transit method's selection bias by focusing on planets with orbital periods between 100 and 1,000 days. We conducted four years of Doppler spectroscopy at Keck Observatory of five planetary systems originally identified by the Kepler mission to host giant planet candidates. This resulted in precise mass and eccentricity measurements for six giant planets. Our sample represents a substantial contribution of well characterized worlds to a previously sparse region of parameter space. Owing to their orbital distances, these giant planets' radii are not inflated like those of hot Jupiters. We can therefore combine our mass and radius measurements to gain new insights into the relationship between mass and radius for cool giant planets akin to Jupiter and Saturn., We began a Doppler monitoring campaign with the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope at Lick Observatory as part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS). The APF uses the Levy Spectrograph, a high-resolution (R~114000) slit-fed optical echelle spectrometer. In 2020 August, Lick Observatory and the APF shut down owing to nearby wildfires. To maintain our coverage of the emerging Keplerian RVel signal, we temporarily conducted observations of TOI-2180 using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck I telescope at W. M. Keck Observatory. <P />(1 data file)., The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed a single transit of the giant exoplanet TOI-2180 b in Sector 19 of its primary mission. A subsequent effort to characterize this system found that the orbital period of TOI-2180 b is 260.8 ± 0.6 days. This level of precision precludes most efforts to detect future transits and to further understand this exoplanet. We present a new transit of TOI-2180 b observed by TESS in Sector 48 and update the planet's transit ephemeris with its precisely measured orbital period. The refined ephemeris enables future transit observations to explore this planet's atmosphere or to search for rings or moons., We report the discovery of TOI-2180 b, a 2.8 M <SUB>J</SUB> giant planet orbiting a slightly evolved G5 host star. This planet transited only once in Cycle 2 of the primary Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Citizen scientists identified the 24 hr single-transit event shortly after the data were released, allowing a Doppler monitoring campaign with the Automated Planet Finder telescope at Lick Observatory to begin promptly. The radial velocity observations refined the orbital period of TOI-2180 b to be 260.8 ± 0.6 days, revealed an orbital eccentricity of 0.368 ± 0.007, and discovered long-term acceleration from a more distant massive companion. We conducted ground-based photometry from 14 sites spread around the globe in an attempt to detect another transit. Although we did not make a clear transit detection, the nondetections improved the precision of the orbital period. We predict that TESS will likely detect another transit of TOI-2180 b in Sector 48 of its extended mission. We use giant planet structure models to retrieve the bulk heavy-element content of TOI-2180 b. When considered alongside other giant planets with orbital periods over 100 days, we find tentative evidence that the correlation between planet mass and metal enrichment relative to stellar is dependent on orbital properties. Single-transit discoveries like TOI-2180 b highlight the exciting potential of the TESS mission to find planets with long orbital periods and low irradiation fluxes despite the selection biases associated with the transit method. *Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., Radial velocity (RV) surveys have discovered giant exoplanets on au-scale orbits with a broad distribution of eccentricities. Those with the most eccentric orbits are valuable laboratories for testing theories of high-eccentricity migration. However, few such exoplanets transit their host stars, thus removing the ability to apply constraints on formation from their bulk internal compositions. We report the discovery of Kepler-1704 b, a transiting 4.15 M<SUB>J</SUB> giant planet on a 988.88 day orbit with an extreme eccentricity of ${0.921}_{-0.015}^{+0.010}$ . Our decade-long RV baseline from the Keck I telescope allows us to measure the orbit and bulk heavy-element composition of Kepler-1704 b and place limits on the existence of undiscovered companions. A failed hot Jupiter, Kepler-1704 b was likely excited to high eccentricity by scattering events that possibly began during its gas accretion phase. Its final periastron distance was too large to allow for tidal circularization, so now it orbits its host from distances spanning 0.16-3.9 au. The maximum difference in planetary equilibrium temperature resulting from this elongated orbit is over 700 K. A simulation of the thermal phase curve of Kepler-1704 b during periastron passage demonstrates that it is a remarkable target for atmospheric characterization from the James Webb Space Telescope, which could potentially also measure the planet's rotational period as the hot spot from periastron rotates in and out of view. Continued characterization of the Kepler-1704 system promises to refine theories explaining the formation of hot Jupiters and cool giant planets like those in the solar system. <SUP>*</SUP> Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., Despite the severe bias of the transit method of exoplanet discovery toward short orbital periods, a modest sample of transiting exoplanets with orbital periods greater than 100 days is known. Long-term radial velocity (RV) surveys are pivotal to confirming these signals and generating a set of planetary masses and densities for planets receiving moderate to low irradiation from their host stars. Here we conduct RV observations of Kepler-1514 from the Keck I telescope using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. From these data, we measure the mass of the statistically validated giant (1.108 ± 0.023 R<SUB>J</SUB>) exoplanet Kepler-1514 b with a 218-day orbital period as 5.28 ± 0.22 M<SUB>J</SUB>. The bulk density of this cool (∼390 K) giant planet is ${4.82}_{-0.25}^{+0.26}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, consistent with a core supported by electron degeneracy pressure. We also infer an orbital eccentricity of ${0.401}_{-0.014}^{+0.013}$ from the RV and transit observations, which is consistent with planet-planet scattering and disk cavity migration models. The Kepler-1514 system contains an Earth-size, Kepler Object of Interest on a 10.5-day orbit that we statistically validate against false-positive scenarios, including those involving a neighboring star. The combination of the brightness (V = 11.8) of the host star and the long period, low irradiation, and high density of Kepler-1514 b places this system among a rare group of known exoplanetary systems and as one that is amenable to continued study. <SUP>*</SUP> Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We conducted speckle imaging observations of 53 stellar systems that were members of long-term radial velocity (RV) monitoring campaigns and exhibited substantial accelerations indicative of planetary or stellar companions in wide orbits. Our observations were made with blue and red filters using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument at Gemini-South and the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager at the WIYN telescope. The speckle imaging identifies eight luminous companions within 2″ of the primary stars. In three of these systems—HD 1388, HD 87359, and HD 104304—the properties of the imaged companion are consistent with the RV measurements, suggesting that these companions may be associated with the primary and the cause of the RV variation. For all 53 stellar systems, we derive differential magnitude limits (i.e., contrast curves) from the imaging. We extend this analysis to include upper limits on companion mass in systems without imaging detections. In 25 systems, we rule out companions with masses greater than 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting that the observed RV signals are caused by late-M dwarfs or substellar (potentially planetary) objects. On the other hand, the joint RV and imaging analysis almost entirely rules out planetary explanations of the RV signal for HD 19522 and suggests that the companion must have an angular separation below a few tenths of an arcsecond. This work highlights the importance of combined RV and imaging observations for characterizing the outer regions of nearby planetary systems., Exoplanet characterization typically begins with a measurement of planet mass and radius. The standard method of measuring a planet's radius requires the planet to transit, which severely biases the sample to those with orbital periods of a few dozen days or less. The resulting dearth of well characterized exoplanets at wider separations hinders our ability to answer fundamental questions of planetary formation, evolution, and even habitability. Here, we introduce the Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT 'EM) Survey, an ongoing long-term campaign at the Keck I telescope to measure the masses of giant transiting planets with orbital periods of hundreds to 1,000 days. The GOT 'EM survey is substantially increasing the number of weakly irradiated giant planets with measured mass and radius. This effort is complementary to the characterization of short-period exoplanets and enables novel comparisons between exoplanets and the Solar System giants. The first result of this survey is the confirmation of a 5 Jupiter-mass giant planet in the Kepler-1514 system with an eccentric (e=0.4), 217-day orbit. Known as Kepler-1514b, this planet is one of only a rare few giant planets that receives low enough stellar irradiation that its size, and thereby density, are not affected by radius inflation. We also validate the existence of Kepler-1514c, a transiting Earth-size planet with an orbital period of 10.5 days previously known only as a Kepler Object of Interest. Given the brightness of the host star (V=11.8), we explore this system's potential for continued follow-up characterization, including a possible measurement of stellar obliquity. Finally, we explain how Kepler-1514b, and all of the transiting cool giant planets in the ongoing GOT 'EM survey, are improbable discoveries that greatly inform models of planetary interiors and formation at orbital periods approaching those of the Solar System giant planets., Planetary systems that show single-transit events are a critical pathway to increasing the yield of long-period exoplanets from transit surveys. From the primary Kepler mission, KIC 5951458 b (Kepler-456b) was thought to be a single-transit giant planet with an orbital period of 1310 days. However, radial velocity (RV) observations of KIC 5951458 from the HIRES instrument on the Keck telescope suggest that the system is far more complicated. To extract precise RVs for this $V\approx 13$ star, we develop a novel matched-template technique that takes advantage of a broad library of template spectra acquired with HIRES. We validate this technique and measure its noise floor to be 4-8 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> (in addition to internal RV error) for most stars that would be targeted for precision RVs. For KIC 5951458, we detect a long-term RV trend that suggests the existence of a stellar companion with an orbital period greater than a few thousand days. We also detect an additional signal in the RVs that is possibly caused by a planetary or brown dwarf companion with mass in the range of 0.6-82 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and orbital period below a few thousand days. Curiously, from just the data on hand, it is not possible to determine which object caused the single ""transit"" event. We demonstrate how a modest set of RVs allows us to update the properties of this unusual system and predict the optimal timing for future observations. <SUP>∗</SUP> Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., We began monitoring the Radial Velocity (RV) variation of HD332231 in 2019-October to measure the companion's mass and further characterize the system. The majority of the RV observations were acquired with the 2.4m Automated Planet Finder (APF) Telescope at Lick Observatory under the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) and another program dedicated to single-transit follow-up (2019B-A006, PI:Dalba). We supplemented the APF data set with additional observations from the 10m Keck I telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory. <P />Automated Planet Finder Telescope (APF)-Levy observed HD332231 using the W decker, which has a width of 1"" in the spectral dimension and 3"" in the spatial dimension. This slit provides a resolving power of R~114000 for a continuous spectrum between 3740 and 9700Å. <P />Keck-I is equipped with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES). We acquired 13 high-resolution (R~60000) spectra of HD332231. We also acquired a high-S/N spectral template using Keck-HIRES that was used in the forward modeling procedure to determine the relative Radial Velocities (RVs) of HD332231. <P />Additional RV measurements were collected using the robotic 1m Hertzsprung Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) telescope which is equipped with a high-resolution echelle spectrograph. Thirteen spectra of HD332231 were acquired (R~90000) covering the wavelength range 4400-6900Å. Each spectrum was obtained using an exposure time of 2700s resulting in an S/N of ~50. <P />(1 data file)., We report the detection of a Saturn-size exoplanet orbiting HD 332231 (TOI 1456) in light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). HD 332231 -- an F8 dwarf star with a V-band magnitude of 8.56 -- was observed by TESS in Sectors 14 and 15. We detect a single-transit event in the Sector 15 presearch data conditioning (PDC) light curve. We obtain spectroscopic follow-up observations of HD 332231 with the Automated Planet Finder, Keck I, and SONG telescopes. The orbital period we infer from radial velocity (RV) observations leads to the discovery of another transit in Sector 14 that was masked by PDC due to scattered light contamination. A joint analysis of the transit and RV data confirms the planetary nature of HD 332231 b, a Saturn-size ( ${0.867}_{-0.025}^{+0.027}\ {R}_{{\rm{J}}} ), sub-Saturn-mass ( $0.244\pm 0.021\ {M}_{{\rm{J}}} ) exoplanet on a 18.71 day circular orbit. The low surface gravity of HD 332231 b and the relatively low stellar flux it receives make it a compelling target for transmission spectroscopy. Also, the stellar obliquity is likely measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, an exciting prospect given the 0.14 au orbital separation of HD 332231 b. The spectroscopic observations do not provide substantial evidence for any additional planets in the HD 332231 system, but continued RV monitoring is needed to further characterize this system. We also predict that the frequency and duration of masked data in the PDC light curves for TESS Sectors 14-16 could hide transits of some exoplanets with orbital periods between 10.5 and 17.5 days., We present Spitzer observations of a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog exoplanet with a 2.9-yr orbital period. We refine the ephemeris of this rare outer transiting planet to enable future unprecedented comparative investigations with Jupiter., Relative to the solar system, nearly all of the exoplanets that have been characterized in depth can be described as extreme. They are short-period, blisteringly hot worlds with no analog in the solar system. This inordinate preference of our characterization efforts is driven by the biases of our observational techniques, and primarily those of the transit method. Yet, one of the ultimate goals of exoplanetary science is to place the solar system in a galactic context through comparison to analogous exoplanets. Here, we present Kepler-167e: a true Jupiter-analog exoplanet. Kepler-167e has a Jupiter-like radius, eccentricity, insolation, and temperature. It orbits a K-type star with a period of 1,071 days in a multi-planet system. The 1.6% transit depth and 16-hour transit duration make it a strong target for atmospheric characterization, which stands to be an unprecedented observation. Solar system data have shown the amenability of long-period gaseous exoplanets to transmission spectroscopy, but never before has there been an appropriate target. The Kepler mission caught only two transits of Kepler-167e, revealing its period but leaving the existence of transit timing variations (TTVs) unconstrained. About half of the similarly long-period planets and candidates from Kepler have had TTVs on the order of days, which are devastating to transit follow-up efforts. In the case of Kepler-167e, new Spitzer observations captured the third ever-observed transit of this exoplanet. These observations rule out substantial TTVs for Kepler-167e and refine its transit timing to better than 6 minutes through 2030. Kepler-167e is a transmission spectroscopy opportunity that will not likely be rivaled by a new discovery from any current or planned transit survey. For the remarkable case of Kepler-167e, we describe how Kepler overcame the short-period bias, how Spitzer overcame the TTV uncertainty, and how JWST is poised to make the first atmospheric observation of an exoplanet akin to Jupiter and Saturn., Exoplanets that transit their host stars are an immensely valuable source of information. Their radii can be inferred from the transit flux decrease, their masses can be uniquely measured from the reflex motion of the star, and their atmospheres can be probed via transit spectroscopy. Yet, the transit method is severely biased toward exoplanets with orbital distances much smaller than that of Mercury. The short observational baselines of most exoplanet transit surveys further drive the short-period preference of transit studies. As a result, most known transiting planets are substantially hotter than any planet in the Solar System. Finding potentially habitable worlds then relies on searching cooler stars, which introduces numerous uncertainties about the ability for life to develop and survive in such systems. It may prove beneficial to avoid these issues by extending the search for habitable terrestrial exoplanets to Earth-like orbital distances around Sun-like stars. I will discuss the challenges faced by efforts to detect and characterize transiting exoplanets with orbital periods akin to that of the Earth or even longer. These include the recovery of exoplanets that are only seen to transit once, the refinement of orbital ephemerides that become stale, and the measurement of transit timing variations caused by unknown companions. I will discuss telescope architectures and techniques that can be used to confront these challenges, with an emphasis on the need for community-wide collaboration. Finally, I will offer predictions for the future of efforts to detect and characterize transiting exoplanets with orbital separations akin to the Solar System planets., Kepler-167e is a long-period (P=1,071 days), Jupiter-size exoplanet that was discovered in transit observations by the Kepler spacecraft during its primary mission. Many properties of Kepler-167e including its eccentricity, stellar insolation, and equilibrium temperature are strikingly similar to those of Jupiter, making this exoplanet an excellent candidate for comparative planetology. Kepler observed only two transits of Kepler-167e, which left the existence of transit timing variations (TTVs) unknown. Many long-period exoplanets and candidates have shown TTVs of up to 40 hours in duration. Until the existence of such TTVs are constrained, follow-up transit observations (e.g., for atmospheric characterization) are extremely risky. We present new Spitzer observations of Kepler-167 that recover a partial transit of Kepler-167e. These observations constrain the extent of TTVs in the system, and enable accurate and precise predictions of future transits through the anticipated era of JWST., We use published stellar, orbital, and planetary parameters to estimate the transit probabilities for nearly all exoplanets that have been discovered via the RV method. <P />(1 data file)., We acquired observations of a partial transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog exoplanet on a 1071 day orbit, well beyond its water ice line, with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The timing of the Spitzer transit is consistent with the ephemeris measured from the two transits observed previously by the Kepler Space Telescope. The Spitzer observation rules out the existence of transit timing variations (TTVs) on the order of hours to days that are known to exist for other long-period exoplanets. Such TTVs render transit follow-up efforts intractable due to the substantial observing time required and the high risk of nondetection. For Kepler-167e, however, we are now able to predict future transit times through the anticipated era of the James Webb Space Telescope with uncertainties of less than six minutes. We interpret the lack of TTVs as an indication that Kepler-167e either does not have an exterior massive companion or that the gravitational interactions with any companions are below our detection threshold. We also measure Kepler-167e’s 3.6 μm transit depth and use exoplanet and solar system models to make predictions about its transmission spectrum. The transiting nature of Kepler-167e and its similarity to Jupiter make it a unique and exceptional target for follow-up atmospheric characterization. Kepler-167e falls into a truly rare category among transiting exoplanets, and with a precisely constrained transit ephemeris, it is poised to serve as a benchmark in comparative investigations between exoplanets and the solar system., Radial velocity (RV) surveys have detected hundreds of exoplanets through their gravitational interactions with their host stars. Some will be transiting, but most lack sufficient follow-up observations to confidently detect (or rule out) transits. We use published stellar, orbital, and planetary parameters to estimate the transit probabilities for nearly all exoplanets that have been discovered via the RV method. From these probabilities, we predict that {25.5}<SUB>-0.7</SUB><SUP>+0.7</SUP> of the known RV exoplanets should transit their host stars. This prediction is more than double the amount of RV exoplanets that are currently known to transit. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) presents a valuable opportunity to explore the transiting nature of many of the known RV exoplanet systems. Based on the anticipated pointing of TESS during its two-year primary mission, we identify the known RV exoplanets that it will observe and predict that {11.7}<SUB>-0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> of them will have transits detected by TESS. However, we only expect the discovery of transits for ∼3 of these exoplanets to be novel (i.e., not previously known). We predict that the TESS photometry will yield dispositive null results for the transits of ∼125 RV exoplanets. This will represent a substantial increase in the effort to refine ephemerides of known RV exoplanets. We demonstrate that these results are robust to changes in the ecliptic longitudes of future TESS observing sectors. Finally, we consider how several potential TESS extended mission scenarios affect the number of transiting RV exoplanets we expect TESS to observe., The panoply of exoplanetary discoveries that has emerged over the past three decades has largely been shaped by observational biases. Limited observational baselines and detection efficiencies have so far restricted the majority of exoplanet studies to those with short-period orbits that are strikingly different than the planets in the Solar System. Yet, the fundamental questions surrounding planetary science, ones of formation, evolution, and even habitability, cannot be addressed without probing the outer reaches of planetary systems as well as the inner regions. In my dissertation, I investigated the nature of the cold, long-period worlds that exist at the frontier of exoplanetary science. My studies involved the refinement of orbital ephemerides through transit detection and the development of new atmospheric characterization techniques through atmosphere modeling. Here, I will describe my efforts to recover transits of long-period exoplanets, including new results from a coordinated campaign of ground-based telescopes spread over two continents. I will also discuss my use of Solar System datasets for exoplanet applications. As habitants of Earth, we have the cosmic good fortune of being situated next to several long-period giant planets. These familiar gas giants, and especially the extensive observations of Saturn, enable a comparative approach to the study of exoplanets that is becoming increasingly important. Using Saturn's atmosphere as a ""ground truth,"" I will demonstrate the scientific potential of transmission spectroscopy of cold gas-giant exoplanets. Additionally, I will present new results showing actual observations of refraction phenomena in Saturn's atmosphere and explain its benefit to the characterization of cold gaseous exoplanets. My dissertation laid the foundation for future investigations of cold giant exoplanets, which exist in an almost entirely unexplored regime of exoplanetary science. Using Saturn to provide context and motivation, I will present my efforts to confront the challenges facing this new discipline of exoplanetary science., Titan's ionosphere is an important component of the moon's environment.

We use PRIMO, a novel dictionary-learning-based algorithm that uses high-fidelity simulations of accreting black holes as a training set. By learning the correlations between the different regions of the space of interferometric data, this approach allows us to recover high-fidelity images even in the presence of sparse coverage and reach the nominal resolution of the EHT array. The black hole image comprises a thin bright ring with a diameter of 41.5 ± 0.6 μas and a fractional width that is at least a factor of 2 smaller than previously reported. This improvement has important implications for measuring the mass of the central black hole in M87 based on the EHT images., The sparse interferometric coverage of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) poses a significant challenge for both reconstruction and model fitting of black hole images. PRIMO is a new principal components analysis-based algorithm for image reconstruction that uses the results of high-fidelity general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low-luminosity accretion flows as a training set. This allows the reconstruction of images that are consistent with the interferometric data and that live in the space of images that is spanned by the simulations. PRIMO follows Monte Carlo Markov Chains to fit a linear combination of principal components derived from an ensemble of simulated images to interferometric data. We show that PRIMO can efficiently and accurately reconstruct synthetic EHT data sets for several simulated images, even when the simulation parameters are significantly different from those of the image ensemble that was used to generate the principal components. The resulting reconstructions achieve resolution that is consistent with the performance of the array and do not introduce significant biases in image features such as the diameter of the ring of emission., New horizon-scale images of the Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) recently published by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) allow for new strong-field tests of the Kerr metric in a previously unexplored regime. I will discuss the recent EHT observations of Sgr A* with a particular focus on how these new results can be used to test fundamental physics. I will briefly touch upon the earlier M87 results as well. I will discuss future prospects for the EHT including additional telescopes and a shorter wavelength. Finally, I will introduce a new machine-learning algorithm for EHT data analysis that uses a large library of high-fidelity simulations as a training set. <P />L. M. gratefully acknowledges support from an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship, Award No. AST-1903847., The Event Horizon Telescope recently captured images of the supermassive black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy, which shows a ring-like emission structure with the south side only slightly brighter than the north side. This relatively weak asymmetry in the brightness profile along the ring has been interpreted as a consequence of the low inclination of the observer (around 17° for M87), which suppresses the Doppler beaming and boosting effects that might otherwise be expected due to the nearly relativistic velocities of the orbiting plasma. In this work, we use a large suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to reassess the validity of this argument. By constructing explicit counterexamples, we show that low inclination is a sufficient but not necessary condition for images to have low brightness asymmetry. Accretion flow models with high accumulated magnetic flux close to the black hole horizon (the so-called magnetically arrested disks) and low black hole spins have angular velocities that are substantially smaller than the orbital velocities of test particles at the same location. As a result, such models can produce images with low brightness asymmetry even when viewed edge on., In April of 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) published the first image of a supermassive black hole resolved to event horizon scales. This image led to the first measurement of the size of a black-hole shadow, the shadow that the black hole casts on the surrounding emission. We use analytic calculations and numerical simulations to place constraints on regular, parametric, non-Kerr metrics and to identify the common characteristic among these different parametrizations that controls the predicted shadow size. We also connect our work to previous tests and show that spacetimes that deviate from the Kerr metric but satisfy weak-field tests can lead to large deviations in the predicted black-hole shadows that are inconsistent with even the current EHT measurements. <P />NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow., The identity and experience of past human societies has crystallized in the buildings that survive up to the present day, as architectural and archaeological heritage. The challenges of their study, management and communication are now in constant reshaping, as new technologies consistently bring new tools, opportunities and trials. Today, the values and meanings attached to this heritage by their communities are to be promoted by the strategies towards cultural heritage research, protection, enhancement, reuse or dissemination, as defined by the Faro Convention (CoE, 2005), but community involvement and interdisciplinarity are still goals often difficult to attain. In this contribution we aim to present two different case studies where strategies of state-of-the-art documentation and historical-archaeological assessment were brought together to address communities' requests for heritage valorization while providing opportunities for interdisciplinary work, specialized education, and content creation. One is in the Finnish town of Hamina, a star-like fortress system which echoes the Renaissance urban ideals, achieved only in another place in Europe (Palma Nova, Italy), where an International Summer School took place to address the community's requests for study and documentation. Another is in the Portuguese village of Muge, Salvaterra de Magos, where the need for scientific study and documentation addressed the owner's goals for site musealization while providing interdisciplinary work and education to several undergrad and masters students in archaeology and architecture, while building contents for community engagement and outreach., The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is taking the first images of black holes resolved at horizon scales to measure their shadows and probe accretion physics. A promising avenue for testing the hypothesis that astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr solution to Einstein's equations is to compare the size and shape of the shadow a black hole casts on the surrounding emission to the predictions of the Kerr metric. We develop here an efficient parametric framework to perform this test. We carry out ray-tracing simulations for several parameterized non-Kerr metrics to create a large data set of non-Kerr shadows that probe the allowed parameter space for the free parameters of each metric. We then perform principal components analysis (PCA) on this set of shadows and show that only a small number of components are needed to accurately reconstruct all shadows within the set. We further show that the amplitude of the PCA components are smoothly related to the free parameters in the metrics and, therefore, that these PCA components can be fit to EHT observations in order to place constraints on the free parameters of these metrics that will help quantify any potential deviations from the Kerr solution., Our understanding of black holes assumes that they are described by the Kerr solution to Einstein's equations. A promising avenue for testing the Kerr hypothesis is to detect the shadow a black hole casts on the surrounding emission and compare its size and shape to the predictions of the Kerr metric. On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a very long baseline interferometry experiment, released the first image of a black hole resolved to event horizon scales. I will discuss how we can use the Event Horizon Telescope to test the Kerr nature of black holes, both with this first image and in the future., The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a mm-wavelength very long baseline interferometer (VLBI), aims to take the first ever resolved image of a black hole at event horizon scales. I will discuss how I use numerical simulations to characterize the effect of intrinsic source variability and deviations from the Kerr geometry on interferometric observables. I show that intrinsic source variability will significantly affect conventional image reconstruction techniques and that variability must be taken in to account for both image synthesis and model fitting. Furthermore, I explore the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to characterize the structural variability in GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and find that simulations can be compactly represented with a PCA-derived basis of eigenimages. This allows for detailed comparisons between variable observations and time-dependent models. Finally, I use parametrized metrics that deviate from the Kerr metric and that can be used to approximate several modified gravity theories, to simulate a large number of black hole shadows. I apply PCA to the set of shadows and show that only a handful of ""eigen-shadows"" are necessary to reconstruct the full set of non-Kerr and Kerr shadows., , We explore the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize high-fidelity simulations and interferometric observations of the millimeter emission that originates near the horizons of accreting black holes. We show mathematically that the Fourier transforms of eigenimages derived from PCA applied to an ensemble of images in the spatial domain are identical to the eigenvectors of PCA applied to the ensemble of the Fourier transforms of the images, which suggests that this approach may be applied to modeling the sparse interferometric Fourier-visibilities produced by an array such as the Event Horizon Telescope. We also show that the simulations in the spatial domain can themselves be compactly represented with a PCA-derived basis of eigenimages, which allows for detailed comparisons to be made between variable observations and time-dependent models, as well as for detection of outliers or rare events within a time series of images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectrum of PCA eigenvalues is a diagnostic of the power spectrum of the structure and, hence, of the underlying physical processes in the simulated and observed images., The Event Horizon Telescope will generate horizon scale images of the black hole in the center of the Milky Way, Sgr A*. Image reconstruction using interferometric visibilities rests on the assumption of a stationary image. We explore the limitations of this assumption using high-cadence disk- and jet-dominated GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*. We also employ analytic models that capture the basic characteristics of the images to understand the origin of the variability in the simulated visibility amplitudes. We find that, in all simulations, the visibility amplitudes for baselines oriented parallel and perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole follow general trends that do not depend strongly on accretion-flow properties. This suggests that fitting Event Horizon Telescope observations with simple geometric models may lead to a reasonably accurate determination of the orientation of the black hole on the plane of the sky. However, in the disk-dominated models, the locations and depths of the minima in the visibility amplitudes are highly variable and are not related simply to the size of the black hole shadow. This suggests that using time-independent models to infer additional black hole parameters, such as the shadow size or the spin magnitude, will be severely affected by the variability of the accretion flow., Closure phases along different baseline triangles carry a large amount of information regarding the structures of the images of black holes in interferometric observations with the Event Horizon Telescope. We use long time span, high cadence, GRMHD+radiative transfer models of Sgr A* to investigate the expected variability of closure phases in such observations. We find that, in general, closure phases along small baseline triangles show little variability, except in the cases when one of the triangle vertices crosses one of the small regions of low visibility amplitude. The closure phase variability increases with the size of the baseline triangle, as larger baselines probe the small-scale structures of the images, which are highly variable. On average, the funnel-dominated MAD models show less closure phase variability than the disk-dominated SANE models, even in the large baseline triangles, because the images from the latter are more sensitive to the turbulence in the accretion flow. Our results suggest that image reconstruction techniques need to explicitly take into account the closure phase variability, especially if the quality and quantity of data allow for a detailed characterization of the nature of variability. This also implies that, if image reconstruction techniques that rely on the assumption of a static image are utilized, regions of the u-v space that show a high level of variability will need to be identified and excised., We present results from a study of a sample of 144 SDSS quasars with measured black hole masses. The sample consists of 84 high-redshift (z&gt;2.5) radio-loud quasars with black hole masses derived from CIV line widths, and 60 low-redshift quasars (1.5&lt;z&lt; 2.2) with mass measurements based on the FWHM of both the Balmer and CIV lines. We applied a power law model to the baseline continuum to derive the spectral index and the luminosity at 2500A. Using a standard accretion disk model, we derived the maximum disk temperature, the mass of the central black hole, the mass accretion rate, the disk luminosity, and the Eddington luminosity ratio. We found that quasars in the high redshift sample had slightly lower black hole masses (log(M/M_sun) = 8.3 to 9.4) compared to the low redshift sample (log(M/M_sun) = 8.6 to 9.5). The range of accretion disk temperatures in the high-redshift quasars extended toward higher values than in the low redshift sample (2e4 K to 1e5 K versus 2e4 K to 7e4 K, respectively). The high redshift sample was characterized by a median Eddington luminosity ratio of 0.2 as opposed to 0.1 for the low redshift sample, confirming that quasars were growing more rapidly in the early universe. We found the precision of the black hole mass estimation method based on the standard accretion disk model to be comparable to that relying on the properties of the CIV line. In the future, our mass measurement method could be applied to the photometric data of SDSS quasars that lack spectroscopic information.

The WM is treated as a reduced relativistic gas (RRG) and the other three components are treated in the usual way. The solutions achieved contains one, two or three components of which one component is of WM type. A solution involving all the four components was not found., This work presents a complete cyclic cosmological scenario based on nonlinear magnetic field. It is constructed from a model composed of five fluids, namely baryonic matter, dark matter, radiation, neutrinos and a cosmological magnetic field. The first four fluids are treated in the standard way and the fifth fluid, the magnetic field, is described by a nonlinear electrodynamics. The free parameters are fitted by observational data (SNIa, CMB, extragalactic magnetic fields, etc.) and by simple theoretical considerations. As a result arises a cyclic cosmological model that preserves the main successes of the standard Big Bang model and solves some other problems such as the initial singularity, the present acceleration and the Big Rip., We present findings from an ammonia molecular line study of the Serpens South star-forming cluster, within the Serpens molecular cloud, performed using the K-band Focal Plane Array at the GBT. We have mapped a 40' by 30' area in the NH3 (1,1), (2,2) and (3,3) inversion transitions, as well as in HC7N 21-20. The NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) emission was used to derive kinetic temperatures across the region, which range from 7.5 K to 17.5 K. Despite a 10 K range of temperature for NH3, all of the HC7N was found within the 2 K range of 9.5 K and 11.5 K. We find the distribution of both molecules throughout the cloud is different, although the line-of-sight velocities agree well. The HC7N emission peaks do not coincide with peaks in NH3 emission, and we additionally find HC7N in areas with very low NH3 abundance. Where present, the abundance of HC7N is broadly consistent with previous studies of other carbon chain producing regions. Finally, we find self-absorbed HC7N emission towards several dense cores, with line profiles suggesting both infall and outflow motions. We fit the line profiles to determine infall and outflow velocities for these regions., Entende-se por cosmoeducação o desenvolvimento vivencial da unidade homem-cosmo. Este conceito é norteado pela psicologia transpessoal, que estuda o ser humano em sua totalidade, onde suas relações ecológicas e cósmicas são de grande importância. Constata-se uma necessidade latente no ser humano moderno em resgatar uma relação holística com o Universo. Neste trabalho exploramos meios de cultivar a consciência de que o ser humano constitui parte integrante do cosmo e se relaciona com este com o objetivo de promover em si uma percepção ambiental mais ampla. Nossa hipótese de trabalho inicial foi que o ensino de conteúdos básicos em astronomia realizado através de uma abordagem holística, que incorpore práticas vivenciais correlacionadas àqueles conteúdos, pode despertar no indivíduo sua identidade cósmica. O método que utilizamos é o fenomenológico e o universo desta pesquisa é um grupo de estudantes da disciplina de Astronomia (Curso de Licenciatura em Geografia/UFRN), onde realizamos observação participante, entrevistas, depoimentos e as práticas vivenciais mencionadas. Neste caso estamos desenvolvendo e adaptando exercícios de algumas técnicas terapêuticas de psicologia transpessoal, que um de nós (LALM) tem aplicado no contexto clínico, para trabalhar aspectos cognitivos envolvidos naquele processo de conscientização cósmica. Resultados parciais claramente referendam a hipótese inicial. Um resultado a destacar é fruto de uma dinâmica de representação corporal interiorizada do eclipse lunar, envolvendo um pequeno grupo daqueles estudantes, na qual conteúdos míticos afloraram de maneira espontânea e contundente para todos, sugerindo ressonância, ou pelo menos isomorfismo, entre o macro e o microcosmo. Este e outros resultados são discutidos em detalhe neste trabalho.

Recent results from JWST have reinforced the status of XMDs as nearby laboratories for protogalaxy star formation processes. The persistence of this population of galaxies at z = 0 has been attributed at different times to either the efficient removal of metals via outflows, or to inflows of pristine gas from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The bulk environmental properties of XMDs provide clues to their interactions with the IGM. We discuss the completeness of current XMD samples, their bulk properties, and the spatial distribution of known XMDs within D &lt; 100 Mpc. We find that XMDs are preferentially located along the edges of large-scale filaments and superclusters. In the Local Volume (D &lt; 11 Mpc), the bulk of XMDs are clustered at right ascensions between 9h-10h, to the west of the Virgo cluster, with a roughly co-linear north-south alignment. In three dimensions, this resolves to a large (~10 Mpc) filamentary structure, approximately parallel to previously-known filaments on the western side of the Virgo cluster. The existence of this filament suggests that the ongoing star formation in XMDs is fueled by a common reservoir of nearly pristine intergalactic gas. We identify a sample of XMDs within the Illustris TNG-100 simulation at z = 0, and perform a similar analysis on their environment and clustering characteristics. We find that the Illustris XMDs are found in less dense environments than a sample of mass-matched ""normal"" metallicity dwarf galaxies. When examining the bulk astrophysical properties of the Illustris XMDs over cosmic time, we discover that these galaxies do not possess ""extreme"" metallicities over their entire histories: instead there is a drop in gas-phase metallicity approximately 2 Gyr prior to selection, which corresponds to a drop in star formation rate. While the specific inflow and outflow histories vary greatly between individual XMDs within TNG-100, the decline in metallicity of these galaxies does follow the metallicity of the inflowing material from the IGM. We conclude that is the combination of these two shared features — low metallicity inflows paired with decreased star formation efficiency — that creates the population of XMDs in the modern universe., Extremely metal-deficient (XMD) galaxies, with nebular oxygen abundances of less than one-tenth the Solar abundance, are a rare class of nearby dwarf galaxies commonly treated as Local analogs for early protogalaxies — despite the presence of underlying evolved stellar populations and [alpha/Fe] ratios consistent with multiple prior generations of star formation. The low metallicities of XMDs are commonly understood to be the result of low galactic halo masses, which permit efficient ejection the products of stellar nucleosynthesis into the intergalactic medium. I discuss the completeness of current XMD samples within 100 Mpc, and the spatial distribution of XMDs within the Local Volume (D &lt; 11 Mpc). I find that XMDs are preferentially located along the edges of large-scale filaments and superclusters. In the Local Volume, the bulk of XMDs are clustered at right ascensions between 9h - 10h, to the west of the Virgo cluster, in a roughly co-linear alignment with a north-south orientation. This suggests that the current star formation in these galaxies is fueled by a common reservoir of nearly pristine intergalactic gas, located on the near west side of the Virgo supercluster., Many of the canonical star-forming laws commonly used in the local universe are found to deviate at extreme metallicities, typically at nebular oxygen abundances below 12+[O/H] &lt; 8.1, or 1/5 1/10 the Solar abundance. The behavior of the infrared-radio relationship at low metallicities is not well known, however, largely due to lack of radio continuum detections at the low luminosity end. It is possible to correct this situation with the upgraded Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). Using a sample of 10 extreme dwarf galaxies with archival mid- and far-infrared data, and nebular oxygen abundances ranging from 8.1 &lt; 12 + [O/H] &lt; 7.1, I investigate the effects of extreme metallicities on the infrared-radio relationship using 40 hours of C, S, and L-band observations with the JVLA. C-band (4-8 GHz) radio continuum emission is detected from all 10 of these galaxies. These represent the deepest observations at these frequencies for all of these galaxies, and the first radio continuum detections from five galaxies: Leo A, UGC 4704, HS 0822+3542, SBS 0940+544, and SBS 1129+476. The radio continuum in these galaxies is strongly associated with the presence of optical H-alpha emission, with flat spectral slopes suggesting a mix of thermal and non-thermal continuum., In the upcoming decade, powerful new astronomical facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and ground-based 30-meter telescopes will open up the epoch of reionization to direct astronomical observation. One of the primary tools used to understand the bulk astrophysical properties of the high-redshift universe are empirically-derived star-forming laws, which relate observed luminosity to fundamental astrophysical quantities such as star formation rate. The radio/infrared relation is one of the more mysterious of these relations: despite its somewhat uncertain astrophysical origins, this relation is extremely tight and linear, with 0.3 dex of scatter over five orders of magnitude in galaxy luminosity. The effects of primordial metallicities on canonical star-forming laws is an open question: a growing body of evidence suggests that the current empirical star forming laws may not be valid in the unenriched, metal-poor environment of the very early universe.In the modern universe, nearby dwarf galaxies with less than 1/10th the Solar metal abundance provide an opportunity to recalibrate our star formation laws and study the astrophysics of extremely metal-deficient (XMD) environments in detail. I assemble a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies, all within 100 megaparsecs, with nebular oxygen abundances between 1/5th and 1/50th Solar. I identify the subsample of these galaxies with space-based mid- and far-infrared data, and investigate the effects of extreme metallicities on the infrared-radio relationship. For ten of these galaxies, I have acquired 40 hours of observations with the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). C-band (4-8 GHz) radio continuum emission is detected from all 10 of these galaxies. These represent the first radio continuum detections from seven galaxies in this sample: Leo A, UGC 4704, HS 0822+3542, SBS 0940+544, and SBS 1129+476. The radio continuum in these galaxies is strongly associated with the presence of optical H-alpha emission, with spectral slopes suggesting a mix of thermal and non-thermal sources. I use the ratio of the radio and far-infrared emission to investigate behavior of the C-band (4-8 GHz) radio/infrared relation at metallicities below 1/10th Solar. I compare the low metallicity sample with the 4.8 GHz radio/infrared relationship from the KINGFISHER nearby galaxy sample Tabatabaei et al. 2017 and to the 1.4 GHz radio/infrared relationship from the blue compact dwarf galaxy sample of Wu et al. 2008. The infrared/radio ratio q of the low metallicity galaxies is below the average q of star forming galaxies in the modern universe. I compare these galaxies' infrared and radio luminosities to their corresponding Hα luminosities, and find that both the infrared/Hα and the radio/H-alpha ratios are reduced by nearly 1 dex in the low metallicity sample vs. higher metallicity galaxies; however the deficit is not straightforwardly interpreted as a metallicity effect., Attendance at meetings and conferences is a critical component of an astronomer's professional life, providing opportunities for presenting one's work, staying current in the field, career networking, and scientific collaboration. Exclusion from these gatherings due to lack of accessibility and accommodation failure is a reality for disabled astronomers, and contributes substantially to low levels of representation in the senior-most levels of the field. We present a preview of the AAS Working Group for Accessibility and Disability's best practice recommendations for meetings accessibility. Applying the principles of universal access and barrier-free design, we model a paradigm of anticipating and removing accessibility barriers in advance, rather than putting the burden of requesting accommodation solely on disabled astronomers and students. We cite several professional and nonprofessional societies identified as meetings accessibility exemplars, and model our guidelines on their best practices. We establish standards for accessibility budgeting, venue choice, publication of policies online, designating point persons, and identifying barriers. We make recommendations for oral and poster presentations, event registration, receptions and banquets, excursions, and other typical conference activities. For meetings which are constrained by fixed budgets and venue choice, we identify a number of low cost/high reward accessibility steps which might still have a large beneficial impact. We likewise provide adapted recommendations for low budget meetings. THIS IS A POSTER LOCATED IN THE AAS BOOTH, Empirically-determined star formation relations link observed galaxy luminosities to extrapolated star formation rates at almost every observable wavelength range. These laws are a cornerstone of extragalactic astronomy, and will be critically important for interpreting upcoming observations of early high-redshift protogalaxies with JWST and WFIRST. There are indications at a variety of wavelengths that these canonical relations may become unreliable at the lowest metallicities observed. This potentially complicates interpretation of the earliest protogalaxies, which are expected to be pristine and largely unenriched by stellar nucleosynthesis. Using a sample of 15 local dwarf galaxies with 12+[O/H] &lt; 8.2, I focus on two of these relations: the far-infrared/radio relation and the H-alpha/ultraviolet relation. The sample is chosen to have pre-existing far-IR and UV observations, and to span the full spread of the galaxy mass-metallicity relationship at low luminosity, so that luminosity and metallicity may be examined separately. Radio continuum observations of low metallicity dwarf galaxies 1 Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052E suggest that the far-IR/radio relation probably deviates at low metallicities, but the low luminosity end of the relation is not well sampled. The upgraded Jansky Very Large Array has the sensitivity to fill in this gap. I have obtained 45 hours of L- and C-band continuum data of my dwarf galaxy sample. I present radio continuum imaging of an initial sub-sample of Local Group dwarfs, some of which have never before been detected in radio continuum. The H-alpha/UV relationship is likewise known to become unreliable for dwarf galaxies, though this has been attributed to dwarf galaxy ""bursty-ness"" rather than metallicity effects. I have conducted a parallel survey of emission line imaging to study the underlying astrophysics of the H-alpha/UV relation. Using Balmer decrement imaging, I map out the pixel-to-pixel dust distribution and geometry within the nearest galaxies in my sample. I compare this to GALEX UV imaging. I discuss implications for UV escape fraction, and present initial results of the canonical star-forming relations at low galaxy luminosity and metallicity. THIS IS A POSTER AND WILL BE LOCATED IN THE AAS BOOTH., We present 20-cm Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) observations of the star-forming dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Located at the outer edge of the Local Group, with an oxygen abundance of less than one-tenth of the Solar abundance (12+log O/H = 7.49), Sextans A provides a nearby laboratory for the study of low-metallicity star formation processes. This galaxy is a weak source in the infrared, but exhibits evidence for vigorous star formation-powered outflows in ionized gas, including large-scale H-alpha shells and filaments up to a kpc in length. Sextans A has not previously been detected in radio continuum. The upgraded JVLA and WIDAR correlator provide enhanced sensitivity over previous studies. We resolve a 3.0 mJy (+/- 0.3 mJy) continuum source centered on the brightest star formation region in Sextans A. Using two relatively interference-free windows at 1.4 GHz and 1.85 GHz, we are able to measure the spectral slope of the detected emission. We estimate the non-thermal contribution and the strength of the galaxy's magnetic field. We discuss the impact of low metallicity on the reliability of the IR/radio relation., Optical emission line imaging can produce a wealth of information about the conditions of the interstellar medium, but a full set of custom emission-line filters for a professional-grade telescope camera can cost many thousands of dollars. A cheaper alternative is to use commercially-produced 2-inch narrow-band astrophotography filters. In order to use these standardized filters with professional-grade telescope cameras, custom filter mounts must be manufactured for each individual filter wheel. These custom filter adaptors are produced by 3-D printing rather than standard machining, which further lowers the total cost.I demonstrate the feasibility of this technique with H-alpha, H-beta, and [OIII] emission line mapping of the low metallicity star-forming galaxies IC10 and NGC 1569, taken with my astrophotography filter set on three different 2-meter class telescopes in Southern Arizona., The Working Group on Accessibility and Disability (WGAD) was formed by the Council of the American Astronomical Society in late 2015 in order to monitor and addresses issues of inclusivity in the astronomical community related to disability. WGAD promotes of the principles of universal accessibility and disability justice in both professional astronomy and astronomy education. The short term goals of WGAD for the next two years include producing a set of guidelines for a wide range of activities including supporting improved access to journals, data, and conferences. We will provide information and training regarding universal design as a guiding principle. The longer term goals of WGAD include integrating universal design as primary design strategy across the board in our many aspects of daily work life., Prior to reionization, at redshifts 15 &lt; z &lt; 40, the sudden flux of resonant ultraviolet photons from the first generation of stars is predicted to decouple the ambient intergalactic hydrogen spin temperature from the CMB temperature via the Wouthuysen-Field effect. These Cosmic Dawn photons should therefore be indirectly detectable as a broad and shallow absorption trough in the global redshifted 21-cm spectrum, observable at frequencies in the range of 30 MHz to 100 MHz. Here, we present the results of detailed multi-frequency characterization of the primary beam of the first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1). Our analysis is based on early observations acquired with LWA1 as part of a program that aims to detect the global 21-cm signal between 30 and 88 MHz. We pay particular attention to the problem of controlling the LWA1 beam structure over the wide range of frequencies observed, using customized beamforming coefficients to match the beam shape at high and low frequencies, and to minimize the inadvertant coupling of frequency-dependent sidelobe structure to Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. The LWA1 was commissioned in 2011 and is operated by the University of New Mexico, Virginia Tech and the Naval Research Laboratory. Support for operations and continuing development of the LWA is provided by the NSF under grant AST-1139974 of the University Radio Observatory program. Support for this project is provided by the NSF under grant AST-1109865., We examine the behavior of galaxy luminosity at 6-9 μm, a region of the MIR which includes contributions from several PAH bands, as a function of total infrared luminosity L_{IR}(8-1000 μm), using integrated 8 and 70 μm fluxes for star-forming galaxies in the SWIRE/SDSS overlap sample. Our total sample includes 497 galaxies at z &lt; 0.4, with bolometric luminosities between 8.0 &lt; log(L_{IR}/L_⊙) &lt; 11.8. We measure f_{ν}(8)/f_{ν}(70) flux ratios as a function of L_{IR}, and use spectral line indices from the MPA/JHU Value-Added Catalog to study the behavior of our measured relation as function of galaxy metallicity and nuclear activity. We find that nuclear activity does not systematically change the MIR-FIR relation at these wavelengths. However, metallicity does have a strong effect, with galaxies at 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.8 exhibiting systematically lower f_{ν}(8)/f_{ν}(70) flux values. The 8 μm/FIR relation for the entire SWIRE/SDSS sample has an RMS scatter of 0.2 dex (factor of 2); if only sources with approximately solar metallicity are considered, the RMS scatter drops to 0.128 dex (≈ 30%). A comparison with pre-Spitzer spectral templates suggests that empirical refinements can be made which would improve the agreement of the MIR/FIR ratios. This low-redshift recalibration may be important when interpreting MIPS 24 μm observations of galaxies at z ∼ 2., We examine the behavior of the 6-9 μ m PAH complex as a function of L<SUB>IR</SUB>, using integrated 8, 24, and 70 μ m fluxes for star-forming galaxies in the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE). Using redshifts measured by the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey, we measure 8 μ m-FIR flux ratios for 520 galaxies at z &lt; 0.3, with 8-1000 μ m bolometric luminosities between 8.0 &lt; log<SUB>10}(L<SUB>{IR</SUB>)</SUB> &lt; 11.8. We use spectral line indices from the MPA/JHU Value-Added Catalog to study the behavior of the (f<SUB>8/f<SUB>IR})-L_{IR</SUB></SUB> relation as a function of metallicity and nuclear activity. Comparing with pre-Spitzer spectral templates (e.g., Chary &amp; Elbaz 2001; Dale &amp; Helou 2002) suggests that empirical refinements can be made which would improve the agreement of the mid- to far-infrared luminosity ratios. This low-redshift recalibration may be important when interpreting mid-infrared (e.g. MIPS 24 μ m) observations of galaxies at z ∼ 2.","['2023AAS...24134803M', '2020AAS...23534504M', '2019AAS...23343502M', '2019PhDT.......141M', '2018AAS...23136504M', '2018AAS...23131205M', '2017AAS...23021405M', '2017AAS...22943706M', '2016AAS...22811202M', '2013AAS...22134110M', '2008ASPC..381..332M', '2005AAS...207.6325M', '2005BAAS...37R1250M']","[('galaxy', 50), ('radio', 26), ('star', 24), ('metallicity', 22), ('low', 22), ('sample', 19), ('infrared', 19), ('relation', 18), ('xmds', 16), ('dwarf', 15)]","[(('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 14), (('star', 'formation'), 13), (('radio', 'continuum'), 11), (('star', 'forming'), 10), (('low', 'metallicity'), 8), (('infrared', 'radio'), 7), (('oxygen', 'abundance'), 5), (('ghz', 'radio'), 5), (('radio', 'infrared'), 5), (('galaxy', 'sample'), 5)]","[(('nebular', 'oxygen', 'abundances'), 4), (('star', 'forming', 'laws'), 4), (('jansky', 'large', 'array'), 4), (('star', 'forming', 'galaxies'), 4), (('extremely', 'metal', 'deficient'), 3), (('nearby', 'dwarf', 'galaxies'), 3), (('canonical', 'star', 'forming'), 3), (('infrared', 'radio', 'relationship'), 3), (('radio', 'continuum', 'detections'), 3), (('large', 'array', 'jvla'), 3)]",Dirty

Galaxies that inhabit low-mass dark matter halos provide an ideal test bed for dark matter models by linking observational properties of galaxies at small scales (low mass, low velocity) to low-mass dark matter halos. However, the observed kinematics of these galaxies do not align with the kinematics of the dark matter halos predicted to host them, obscuring our understanding of the low-mass end of the galaxy–halo connection. We use deep H I observations of low-mass galaxies at high spectral resolution in combination with cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies to better understand the connection between dwarf galaxy kinematics and low-mass halos. Specifically, we use H I line widths to directly compare to the maximum velocities in a dark matter halo and find that each deeper measurement approaches the expected one-to-one relationship between the observed kinematics and the predicted kinematics in ΛCDM. We also measure baryonic masses and place these on the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR). Again, our deepest measurements approach the theoretical predictions for the low-mass end of this relation, a significant improvement on similar measurements based on line widths measured at 50% and 20% of the peak. Our data also hint at the rollover in the BTFR predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of ΛCDM for low-mass galaxies., The number of observed low mass galaxies is in conflict with the number predicted by standard cosmological models. Rotation velocities of galaxies provide the observational link to compare the number density of galaxies with a dark matter halo (velocity function). We have used highly sensitive observations of extremely low mass galaxies to populate the unconstrained low mass end of the velocity function of galaxies and compare these observations with simulations of dark matter halos., We present the analysis of the diffuse, low column density H I environment of 18 MHONGOOSE galaxies. We obtained deep observations with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and reached down to a 3σ column density detection limit of N<SUB>HI</SUB> = 6.3 × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> over a 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> line width. We analyze the environment around these galaxies, with a focus on H I gas that reaches column densities below N<SUB>HI</SUB> = 10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We calculate the total amount of H I gas in and around the galaxies, revealing that nearly all of these galaxies contained excess H I outside of their disks. We quantify the amount of diffuse gas in the maps of each galaxy, defined by H I gas with column densities below 10<SUP>19</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, and find a large spread in percentages of diffuse gas. However, by binning the percentage of diffuse H I into quarters, we find that the bin with the largest number of galaxies is the lowest quartile (0%-25% diffuse H I). We identified several galaxies that may be undergoing gas accretion onto the galaxy disk using multiple methods of analysis, including azimuthally averaging column densities beyond the disk, and identifying structure within our integrated intensity (moment 0) maps. We measured H I mass outside the disks of most of our galaxies, with rising cumulative flux even at large radii. We also find a strong correlation between the fraction of diffuse gas in a galaxy and its baryonic mass, and we test this correlation using both Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. We see evidence of a dark matter halo mass threshold of M<SUB>halo</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>11.1</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in which galaxies with high fractions of diffuse H I all reside below. It is in this regime that cold-mode accretion should dominate. Finally, we suggest a rotation velocity of v<SUB>rot</SUB> ∼ 80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> as an upper threshold to find diffuse-gas-dominated galaxies., We present a sample of the Imaging Galaxies Intergalactic and Nearby Environment (IMAGINE) survey with the Parkes Radio Telescope. The IMAGINE survey with Parkes maps the region around 28 galaxies extending out to the virial radius of each galaxy. Within each map, we reached 1σ column density sensitivities of N<SUB>HI</SUB> = 10<SUP>16.15-16.62</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> per channel, and HI mass sensitivities down to M<SUB>HI</SUB> = 10<SUP>4.87</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We were able to quantify the amount of HI mass detected in the circumgalactic medium of each of these galaxies. This allowed us to calculate depletion timescales of each galaxy using the total HI mass throughout the galaxy haloes. We find that most of our galaxies currently contain a sufficient amount of neutral gas to sustain star formation for well over a Hubble time. With this information, we are closer to understanding the role neutral hydrogen plays in galaxy star formation., We report deep, single-dish 21 cm observations of NGC 1052-DF2, taken with the Green Bank Telescope. NGC 1052-DF2, proposed to be lacking in dark matter, is currently classified as an ultra-diffuse galaxy in the NGC 1052 group. We do not detect the galaxy, and derive an upper limit on the H I mass. The galaxy is extremely gas poor, and we find that a 3σ {M}<SUB>{{H</SUB>}{{I}}} detection at a distance of 19 Mpc and using a line width of 3.2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> would have an upper limit of {M}<SUB>{{H</SUB>}{{I}},{lim}}&lt; 5.5× {10}<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. At this mass limit, the gas fraction of neutral gas mass to stellar mass is extremely low, at M <SUB>H I </SUB>/M <SUB>⋆</SUB> &lt; 0.0027. This extremely low gas fraction, comparable to Galactic dwarf spheroidals and gas-poor dwarf ellipticals, implies that either the galaxy is within the virial radius of NGC 1052, where its gas has been stripped due to its proximity to the central galaxy, or that NGC 1052-DF2 is at a distance that is large enough to inhibit detection of its gas. We also estimate the upper limit of the H I mass of NGC 1052-DF2 resided at 13 Mpc. This would give an H I mass of {M}<SUB>{{H</SUB>}{{I}},{lim}}&lt; 2.5× {10}<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an H I gas fraction if M <SUB>H I </SUB>/M <SUB>⋆</SUB> &lt; 0.0024, becoming even more extreme for its environment. While the dark matter fraction would be less extreme at this distance, the neutral gas fraction would be unprecedented for an object in a low-density environment., , The universe contains an abundance of neutral atomic hydrogen, or HI. This HI holds the key to knowing how stars are born, how galaxies form and develop, and how dark matter halos accrete gas from the cosmic web. One of the most crucial questions regarding galaxy formation today is how galaxies accrete their gas and how accretion processes affect subsequent star formation. We are trying to answer these questions by mapping the HI content in a four square degree region around galaxies NGC 1744 and NGC 7424, galaxies to be observed as part of the MHONGOOSE survey. NGC 1744 has already been observed extensively with the VLA, so we will be able to quantify the differences in emission. To do this our GBT maps must be sensitive to column densities on the order of ~10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. With such low column densities, we will be able to search for features of the cosmic web in the form of tidal interactions and cosmic web filaments with its relation to star-forming galaxies.","['arXiv:2306.07417', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad250f', '2023arXiv230607417S', '2024ApJ...964..135S', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.07417', '2022AAS...24013601S', '2021arXiv210107822S', 'arXiv:2101.07822', '10.48550/arXiv.2101.07822', '10.3847/1538-4357/abde45', '2021ApJ...910...69S', '2020AAS...23544401S', '2019ApJ...871L..31S', '2019arXiv190107586S', 'arXiv:1901.07586', '10.3847/2041-8213/ab0084', '10.48550/arXiv.1901.07586', '2019PhDT.......216S', '2017AAS...22913205S']","[('galaxy', 44), ('mass', 24), ('gas', 20), ('low', 17), ('halo', 12), ('dark', 11), ('matter', 11), ('density', 10), ('diffuse', 9), ('ngc', 9)]","[(('low', 'mass'), 11), (('dark', 'matter'), 11), (('matter', 'halo'), 8), (('column', 'density'), 8), (('mass', 'galaxy'), 6), (('line', 'width'), 4), (('diffuse', 'gas'), 4), (('ngc', 'df'), 4), (('gas', 'fraction'), 4), (('mass', 'end'), 3)]","[(('dark', 'matter', 'halos'), 5), (('low', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 4), (('low', 'mass', 'end'), 3), (('dark', 'matter', 'halo'), 3), (('low', 'mass', 'dark'), 2), (('mass', 'dark', 'matter'), 2), (('green', 'bank', 'telescope'), 2), (('reached', 'column', 'density'), 2), (('column', 'densities', 'cm'), 2), (('imagine', 'survey', 'parkes'), 2)]",Dirty

The targets were supplied by PSST and ZTF respectively., , , We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Type Icn supernova (SN Icn) 2022ann, the fifth member of its newly identified class of SNe. Its early optical spectra are dominated by narrow carbon and oxygen P-Cygni features with absorption velocities of ~800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>; slower than other SNe Icn and indicative of interaction with a dense, H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM) that is outflowing slower than typical Wolf-Rayet wind velocities of &gt;1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We identify helium in NIR spectra 2 weeks after maximum and in optical spectra at 3 weeks, demonstrating that the CSM is not fully devoid of helium. Unlike other SNe Icn, the spectra of SN 2022ann never develop broad features from SN ejecta, including in the nebular phase. Compared to other SNe Icn, SN 2022ann has a low luminosity (o-band absolute magnitude of ~-17.7), and evolves slowly. The bolometric light curve is well-modelled by 4.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of SN ejecta interacting with 1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of CSM. We place an upper limit of 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in the explosion. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of 10<SUP>7.34</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (implied metallicity of log(Z/Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>) ≈ 0.10) and integrated star-formation rate of log (SFR) = -2.20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>; both lower than 97 per cent of galaxies observed to produce core-collapse supernovae, although consistent with star-forming galaxies on the galaxy Main Sequence. The low CSM velocity, nickel and ejecta masses, and likely low-metallicity environment disfavour a single Wolf-Rayet progenitor star. Instead, a binary companion is likely required to adequately strip the progenitor and produce a low-velocity outflow., We report the classifications of AT2023ghq and AT2023gjg from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope obtained on 2023 Apr 23 UT.

Detection of the signal will require a model of the radio bright foreground. The foreground, which is mostly radio galaxies, is 4-5 orders of magnitude brighter than the signal and will therefore play a crucial role in its detection. Previously, most radio sources have been modeled as bright points to be subtracted from the data and used in calibration. Our approach combines observations of various objects over multiple nights to build more accurate models of the radio sky. We do this by using a software package called FHD (Fast Holographic Deconvolution), which models objects with complicated internal structures as several points. We combine these point sources over multiple observations by treating them as Gaussian surfaces after extracting the brightest points to be omitted from this smoothing. We believe that using our new models for calibration of the observations could reduce contamination of the reionization signal from foreground emission. Although this research was conducted as part of the HERA (Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array) group, the data used was taken at the MWA (Murchison Widefield Array). The MWA has a much higher resolution than HERA and allows for the creation of better models. If successful, this approach will help narrow the probable limits for 21cm detection., The Twenty-one centimeter emission has the potential to trace the ionization of neutral Hydrogen in the early universe and map its structure.

If successful, this approach will help narrow the probable limits for 21cm detection., In the age of high precision astronomy, detailed instrument characterization will be required to advance scientific observations. In the millimeter and sub-millimeter regime (~90 GHz-5THz) beam characterization of independent pixels in a large format array can be measured for accurate image reconstruction. Broadly speaking, there are two types of beam characterization methods available in this regime: thermal beam mapping and complex beam mapping. The former method is the most basic type of beam measurement, where beams are probed with a single, thermal source and the response of the detector is recorded as a function of source probe position. With complex field patterns, the amplitude and phase pattern of the instrument's beam is measured. Assuming a Gaussian beam, the fundamental beam parameters can be determined by fitting a model function to the measured complex field. The model function can then be used for further optical analysis. With just two orthogonal measurements using a polarized source probe, the beam pattern measurement in a single scan plane can simultaneously characterize a beam's ellipticity, astigmatism, polarization orientation, side lobe level, and coupling fraction to a simulated profile. We present a robust measurement system capable of acquiring complex field radiation pattern measurements of direct detector arrays, which are inherently phase-insensitive. This technique has been demonstrated with microwave kinetic inductance detectors (M-KIDs) but can be expanded to transition edge sensor (TES) arrays with frequency domain multiplexing techniques. We also present an analysis pipeline to extract relevant optical properties from the system. These advantages may be particularly attractive for the next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) mapping missions envisioned for both ground and space-based CMB Stage 4 (CMB-S4) direct-detector based instruments, or for imaging instruments studying extended sources, such as the polarization of thermal emission from dusty molecular clouds as the grains align to the galactic field lines., Complex field measurements are increasingly becoming the standard for state-of-the-art astronomical instrumentation. Complex field measurements have been used to characterize a suite of ground, airborne, and space-based heterodyne receiver missions,<SUP>1-6</SUP> and a description of how to acquire coherent field maps for direct detector arrays was demonstrated in Davis et. al. 2017<SUP>7</SUP>. This technique has the ability to determine both amplitude and phase radiation patterns from individual pixels on an array for direct comparison to optical simulations. Phase information helps to better characterize the optical performance of the array (as compared to total power radiation patterns) by constraining the fit in an additional plane.<SUP>4</SUP> This is a powerful technique to diagnose optical alignment errors through the optical system, as a complex field scan in an arbitrary plane can be propagated either forwards or backwards through optical elements to arbitrary planes along the principal axis. Complex radiation patterns have the advantage that the effects of optical standing waves and alignment errors between the scan system and the instrument can be corrected and removed during post processing. Here we discuss the mathematical framework used in an analysis pipeline developed to process complex field radiation pattern measurements. This routine determines and compensates misalignments of the instrument and scanning system. We begin with an overview of Gaussian beam formalism and how it relates to complex field pattern measurements. Next we discuss a scan strategy using an offset in z along the optical axis that allows first-order optical standing waves between the scanned source and optical system to be removed in post-processing. Also discussed is a method by which the co- and cross-polarization fields can be extracted individually for each pixel by rotating the two orthogonal measurement planes until the signal is the co-polarization map is maximized (and the signal in the cross-polarization field is minimized). We detail a minimization function that can fit measurement data to an arbitrary beam shape model. We conclude by discussing the angular plane wave spectral (APWS) method for beam propagation, including the near-field to far-field transformation., To understand how space suit materials degrade on Mars in-situ, JSC has included space suit materials on the calibration target for the SHERLOC instrument., The Milky Way galaxy is a powerful dynamic system that is highly efficient at recycling material. Stars are born out of intergalactic gas and dust, fuse light elements into heavier elements in their cores, then upon stellar death spread material throughout the galaxy, either by diffusion of planetary nebula or by explosive events for high mass stars, and that gas must cool and condense to form stellar nurseries. Though the stellar lifecycle has been studied in detail, relatively little is known about the processes by which hot, diffuse gas ejected by dying stars cools and conglomerates in the interstellar medium (ISM). Much of this mystery arises because only recently have instruments with sufficient spatial and spectral resolution, sensitivity, and bandwidth become available in the terahertz (THz) frequency spectrum where these clouds peak in either thermal or line emission. In this dissertation, I will demonstrate technology advancement of instruments in this frequency regime with new characterization techniques, machining strategies, and scientific models of the spectral behavior of gas species targeted by these instruments. I begin this work with a description of radiation pattern measurements and their use in astronomical instrument characterization. I will introduce a novel technique to measure complex (phase-sensitive) field patterns using direct detectors. I successfully demonstrate the technique with a single pixel microwave inductance detectors (MKID) experiment. I expand that work by measuring the APEX MKID (A-MKID) focal plane array of 880 pixel detectors centered at 350 GHz. In both chapters I discuss the development of an analysis pipeline to take advantage of all information provided by complex field mapping. I then discuss the design, simulation, fabrication processes, and characterization of a circular-to-rectangular waveguide transformer module integrated into a circularly symmetric feedhorn block. I conclude with a summary of this work and how to advance these technologies for future ISM studies., Here we summarize the initial results from a complex field radiation pattern measurement of a kinetic inductance detector instrument. These detectors are phase insensitive and have thus been limited to scalar, or amplitude-only, beam measurements. Vector beam scans, of both amplitude and phase, double the information received in comparison to scalar beam scans. Scalar beam measurements require multiple scans at varying distances along the optical path of the receiver to fully constrain the divergence angle of the optical system and locate the primary focus. Vector scans provide this information with a single scan, reducing the total measurement time required for new systems and also limiting the influence of system instabilities. The vector scan can be taken at any point along the optical axis of the system including the near-field, which makes beam measurements possible for large systems at high frequencies where these measurements may be inconceivable to be tested in-situ. Therefore, the methodology presented here should enable common heterodyne analysis for direct detector instruments. In principle, this coherent measurement strategy allows phase dependent analysis to be performed on any direct-detect receiver instrument., , Introduction&lt;/u&gt; The development of a mini STEM-based classroom activity designed to integrate these two fields into one project for middle school aged students is presented here. This lesson involves small groups of students constructing a small AM radio receivers. The lesson surrounding the activity focuses on both the physical nature of electromagnetic and AC waves, circuit design, practical applications to AM radio broadcasting, and research applications of radio telescopes. These tools have shown a significant increase in the lesson's primary concept understanding among 6th grade students, as well as net positive STEM awareness and enthusiasm.Content &lt;/u&gt;The primary teaching point for the students to consider and learn during this lesson is 'How does scientific application influence engineering design, and vice versa?' The lesson surrounds the hands-on activity of having students construct their own AM radio receiver. Wave theory and the use of radio instruments for astronomy research are also taught in a traditional lecture format. The activity is designed to complement middle school curriculum, although it has been tested and found suitable for high school and older students as well as the general public.Evaluation and Impact&lt;/u&gt;The evaluation tool that used for the student groups in this project was a Fryer chart, which is a four panel chart with the main topic listed in the center and a single question in each of the four panels. The students are asked to answer the questions in the chart before and after they participate in the lesson activity, each time in a different colored pencil so that the scores can be given to each student before and after they participated in the activity. Student scores improved from 4.5 to 17.9 out of a total of 20 possible points. This is an overall increase of 67% of the total possible points. The questions asked on the quiz cover the range of wave theory, circuit design, and scientific explanation. This factor of improvement shows that the lesson designed for this fellowship project is effective at teaching students about each of those concepts with a single teaching activity., Here we present the methodology and initial results for a new near-field antenna radiation measurement system for submillimeter receivers. The system is based on a 4-port vector network analyzer with two synthesized sources. This method improves on similar systems employing this technique with the use of the network analyzer, which reduces the cost and complexity of the system. Furthermore, a single set of test equipment can analyze multiple receivers with different central frequencies; the frequency range of the system is limited by the output range of the network analyzer and/or the power output of the source signal. The amplitude and phase stability of the system in one configuration at 350 GHz was measured and found to be accurate enough to permit near field antenna measurements. The proper characterization of phase drifts across multiple test configurations demonstrates system reliability. These initial results will determine parameters necessary for implementing a near-field radiation pattern measurement of a Schottky diode receiver operating between 340-360 GHz., The LUNAR (Lunar University Network for Astrophysics Research) team has proposed a revolutionary new telescope design that will make observations from the lunar farside. In order to withstand the harsh conditions on the lunar surface, the telescope must be extremely durable, and lightweight to save on launch costs. The LUNAR Radio Array will thus be made of long Kapton arms to that hold the photon-collecting dipoles. The LUNAR Simulation Laboratory team at the University of Colorado has designed and constructed a vacuum chamber to measure the durability of these antennae materials, as well as test deployment scenarios. The chamber replicates the vacuum, thermal, and UV radiation environment on the lunar surface. Additionally, the chamber houses a lunar simulant bed upon which the experiments are performed. The simulant temperature is controlled by a thermal plate underneath the bed. In the early summer of 2012, the team will run an experiment within the chamber to test the thermal properties of a sheet of Kapton film that has been coated with copper to simulate the dipole array. Several thermocouples will be placed on top of the film to monitor the temperature swings between daytime and nighttime conditions. A video camera will monitor the thermal expansion and contraction of the film. This experiment will follow up on previous testing where the film was placed directly on the thermal plate. The team will determine the difference in temperature transition time since the contact area between a solid plate and a bed of particulates is significant.This will be the pilot experiment that the team has done on top of lunar simulant. The team will be testing the thermal properties of the simulant itself, as well as testing the filtration system that guards the vacuum pumps against contamination. Subsequent experiments will use this data as a baseline., , , This is a position paper advocating the need for a knowledge management approach to integrating the independent areas of robotics research and development., Short-lived radionuclides with half-lives of order 3.7 to .10 Myr appear to have been present and live with abundances higher than background ISM levels during the solar system's formation. Their lifetimes are short compared to the freefall time of the presolar cloud, especially given the time necessary to transport these radionuclides from their creation site to the solar origin site. A SN event has been hypothesized as both the generator of the radionuclides and a trigger to initiate rapid collapse of the presolar cloud. In this model the SN ejecta carries the radionuclides to the solar formation site. This scenario has been well studied via the interaction of a shock with a hypothetical presolar cloud. However, the material of the shock is not the ejecta itself, but the material that lies between the SN and the cloud. Given that low mass stars can often form from dense cores in larger molecular clouds the presolar cloud may have been protected by less dense material surrounding the dense core that became the solar system. The parameters that may affect the possibility of injection are varied, but include, the distance of the cloud from the SN, the ratios of densities in the cloud and the ambient medium, and the thermodynamic properties of the gases in question. We use Zeus-2d to explore the effect these parameters have on the possibility of radionuclide injection, having modified it to include cooling and track the supernova ejecta explicitly., Short-lived radionuclides (RNs) such as <SUP>60</SUP>Fe, <SUP>53</SUP>Mn, an","['2024ATel16895....1D', '2024TNSCR4339....1D', '2024ATel16792....1D', '2024TNSCR3122....1D', '2024TNSCR2792....1D', '2024ATel16754....1D', '2024ATel16733....1D', '2024TNSCR2621....1D', '2024TNSCR2572....1D', '2024ATel16740....1D', '2024TNSCR2034....1D', '2024ATel16664....1D', '2024ATel16478....1D', '2024TNSCR.521....1D', '2024ATel16479....1D', '2024TNSCR.249....1D', '2024ATel16416....1D', '2023TNSAN.348....1D', '2023TNSCR3170....1D', '2023ATel16384....1D', '2023TNSCR3364....1D', '2023ATel16385....1D', '2023ATel16366....1D', '2023ATel16393....1D', '2023TNSCR3315....1D', '2023ATel16372....1D', '2023TNSCR2995....1D', '2023ATel16325....1D', '2023ATel16342....1D', '2023TNSCR2871....1D', '2023ATel16298....1D', '2023TNSCR2644....1D', '2023ATel16236....1D', '2023TNSCR2235....1D', '2023TNSCR2148....1D', '10.48550/arXiv.2211.05134', 'arXiv:2211.05134', '2023MNRAS.523.2530D', '2023MNRAS.tmp.1424D', '2022arXiv221105134D', '10.1093/mnras/stad1433', '2023ATel16009....1D', '2023TNSCR.905....1D', '2023TNSCR.598....1D', '2023ATel15954....1D', '2023TNSCR.685....1D', '2023ATel15966....1D', '2023ATel15961....1D', '2023TNSCR.622....1D', '2023ATel15885....1D', '2023TNSCR.270....1D', '2023ATel16156....1D', '2023TNSCR.145....1D', '2023ATel15869....1D', '2022TNSCR2779....1D', '2022ATel15628....1D', '2022ATel15573....1D', '2022ATel15535....1D', '2022TNSCR2480....1D', '2022TNSCR2186....1D', '2022ATel15498....1D', '2022TNSCR1881....1D', '2022ATel15413....1D', '2022TNSCR1543....1D', '2022TNSCR1756....1D', '2022TNSCR1542....1D', '2022ATel15464....1D', '2022ATel15360....1D', '2022ATel15364....1D', '2022TNSCR1177....1D', '2022TNSCR1189....1D', '2022TNSCR1176....1D', '2022TNSCR.867....1D', '2022ATel15309....1D', '2022ATel15263....1D', '2022ATel15279....1D', '2022TNSCR.714....1D', '2022TNSCR.619....1D', '2022TNSCR.362....1D', '2022TNSCR.520....1D', '2022ATel15221....1D', '2022ATel15242....1D', '2022TNSCR..44....1D', '2022ATel15154....1D', '2021TNSCR4199....1D', '2021ATel15137....1D', '2021TNSCR3790....1D', '2021ATel15047....1D', '2021TNSCR3968....1D', '2021TNSCR3967....1D', '2021TNSCR3966....1D', '2021TNSCR3592....1D', '2021ATel14986....1D', '2021TNSCR3045....1D', '2021TNSCR3133....1D', '2021ATel14905....1D', '2021ATel14892....1D', '2021TNSCR3046....1D', '2021TNSCR2746....1D', '2021ATel14833....1D', '2021ATel14771....1D', '2021ATel14373....1D', '2021TNSCR.382....1D', '2020TNSCR3904....1D', '2020ATel14286....1D', '2020AAS...23634002D', '2020AAS...23510802D', '2019AAS...23343702D', '2018arXiv180908341D', '10.1117/12.2314383', '2018SPIE10708E..2RD', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.08341', 'arXiv:1809.08341', '2018LPI....49.1476D', '2018PhDT........26D', '2016SPIE.9914E..1RD', '10.1117/12.2233760', '2016sgcc.confE...1D', '2015AAS...22543603D', '10.1117/12.2056844', '2014SPIE.9153E..3FD', '2012AAS...22013617D', '2007LPICo1371.3048D', '2007eelo.work.3048D', '2007eelo.work.3074D', '2007LPICo1371.3074D', '2006LPI....37.1072D', '2005BAAS...37.1154D', '2005AAS...207.0408D', '2004BAAS...36.1435D', '2004AAS...205.5621D', '2004BAAS...36.1459D', '2004AAS...205.6806D', '2003BAAS...35.1397D', '2003AAS...20311604D', '2003AAS...202.2908D', '2003BAAS...35..738D', '2003BAAS...35..755D', '2003AAS...202.3905D']","[('observation', 61), ('target', 59), ('classification', 55), ('telescope', 54), ('report', 48), ('spectroscopic', 48), ('spectrograph', 47), ('ut', 46), ('supplied', 46), ('made', 37)]","[(('report', 'classification'), 47), (('spectroscopic', 'observation'), 47), (('target', 'supplied'), 41), (('ut', 'target'), 39), (('telescope', 'made'), 22), (('observation', 'kast'), 18), (('kast', 'spectrograph'), 18), (('shane', 'telescope'), 18), (('goodman', 'spectrograph'), 17), (('soar', 'telescope'), 17)]","[(('ut', 'targets', 'supplied'), 21), (('spectroscopic', 'observations', 'kast'), 18), (('observations', 'kast', 'spectrograph'), 18), (('ut', 'target', 'supplied'), 17), (('kast', 'spectrograph', 'shane'), 16), (('spectrograph', 'shane', 'telescope'), 16), (('identified', 'target', 'management'), 16), (('target', 'management', 'platform'), 16), (('management', 'platform', 'yse'), 16), (('platform', 'yse', 'pz'), 16)]",Dirty

The code is designed to be intuitive to use and as modular as possible, making it possible to use each of its functionalities independently or together. ArtPop has a wide range of scientific and pedagogical use cases, including the measurement of detection efficiencies in current and future imaging surveys, the calculation of integrated stellar population parameters, quantitative comparisons of isochrone models, and the development and validation of astronomical image-processing algorithms. In this paper, we give an overview of the ArtPop package, provide simple coding examples to demonstrate its implementation, and present results from some potential applications of the code. We provide links to the source code that created each example and figure throughout the paper. ArtPop is under active development, and we welcome bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions from the community. https://artpop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ https://github.com/ArtificialStellarPopulations/ArtPop/ https://artpop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html https://github.com/ArtificialStellarPopulations/artpop-paper-figures/blob/main/scripts/, ArtPop (Artificial Stellar Populations) synthesizes stellar populations and simulates realistic images of stellar systems. The code is modular, making it possible to use each of its functionalities independently or together. ArtPop can build stellar populations independently from generating mock images, as one might want to do when interested only in calculating integrated photometric properties of the population. The code can also generate stellar magnitudes and artificial galaxies, which can be inject into real imaging data., We present an in-depth study of surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) in low-luminosity stellar systems. Using the MIST models, we compute theoretical predictions for absolute SBF magnitudes in the LSST, HST ACS/WFC, and proposed Roman Space Telescope filter systems. We compare our calculations to observed SBF-color relations of systems that span a wide range of age and metallicity. Consistent with previous studies, we find that single-age population models show excellent agreement with observations of low-mass galaxies with 0.5 ≲ g - i ≲ 0.9. For bluer galaxies, the observed relation is better fit by models with composite stellar populations. To study SBF recovery from low-luminosity systems, we perform detailed image simulations in which we inject fully populated model galaxies into deep ground-based images from real observations. Our simulations show that LSST will provide data of sufficient quality and depth to measure SBF magnitudes with precisions of ∼0.2-0.5 mag in ultra-faint $\left({10}^{4}\leqslant {M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot }\leqslant {10}^{5}\right)$ and low-mass classical (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≤ 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) dwarf galaxies out to ∼4 Mpc and ∼25 Mpc, respectively, within the first few years of its deep-wide-fast survey. Many significant practical challenges and systematic uncertainties remain, including an irreducible ""sampling scatter"" in the SBFs of ultra-faint dwarfs due to their undersampled stellar mass functions. We nonetheless conclude that SBFs in the new generation of wide-field imaging surveys have the potential to play a critical role in the efficient confirmation and characterization of dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe., The new generation of wide-field imaging surveys will uncover thousands of diffuse dwarf galaxy candidates beyond the Local Group. Reliable distances will be required to confirm the nature of these candidates and to study their numbers and physical properties as a function of environment. Surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) offer a powerful method for measuring galaxy distances using imaging data alone, making it one of the most promising tools for finding and studying dwarf galaxies with current and future wide-field surveys. I will present a detailed study of both the power and limitations of the SBF method in the ultra-low stellar mass regime. Using realistic image simulations in which galaxies are built star-by-star, I will show the dependence of SBF on stellar mass (with incomplete sampling of the IMF), image resolution (seeing), and galaxy distance. I will focus in particular on cases where the traditional assumptions of SBF breakdown and on what other observables might be available to select likely nearby dwarfs for additional follow-up observations. Completing the galaxy census in the nearby universe at very low stellar mass (and generally low surface brightness) will provide some of the most stringent tests of galaxy formation and evolution in LCDM. Therefore, pushing the limits of SBF and understanding what to do when it fails will be essential as we move into the LSST/WFIRST era of wide-field astronomy., Spectra of 59 objects were obtained using the SpeX spectrograph (Rayner et al. 2003PASP..115..362R) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. Observations were conducted between the dates of UT 2016 February 24 and UT 2017 November 22. Spectra of five objects were obtained with the Folded-Port Infrared Echellete (FIRE; Simcoe et al. 2013PASP..125..270S) spectrograph on the Magellan 6.5 m Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Observations were conducted on UT 2016 July 18. One object was observed on UT 2016 December 9 with Astronomy Research using the Cornell Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (ARCoIRIS) on the 4 m Blanco telescope located at the Cerro Tolo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). <P />(7 data files)., We present a high-resolution H- and K-band spectral sequence of ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M1.5 to T5. All spectra were obtained using the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) at a resolving power of R~45,000. Our sample contains both field objects and known low gravity objects, which we are using to empirically search for gravity sensitive features. We are also performing model comparisons between our spectra and the new generation of model atmospheres of Marley et al. 2017, to get measurements of specific properties, including T<SUB>eff</SUB>, logg, and cloud properties for our objects., Our search is based on the first ~200deg<SUP>2</SUP> from the Wide layer Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP; internal data release S16A), an ambitious 300-night imaging survey using the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. An overview of the full survey design is given in Aihara+ (2018PASJ...70S...4A), and the first public data release, which covers ~100deg2, is described in Aihara+ (2018PASJ...70S...8A). <P />(2 data files)., New generation optical imaging surveys are uncovering vast numbers of diffuse galaxies for which obtaining spectroscopic redshifts will be extremely difficult if not impossible. We investigate the use of globular cluster populations as a distance indicator for our new sample of very low surface brightness galaxies discovered with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). The depth of HSC-SSP makes it sensitive to the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) out to distances of ~80 Mpc. Hence, using HSC-SSP imaging data alone, the GCLF should provide distance constraints for many of these galaxies, as well as insight into their formation histories and perhaps their dark matter halos. Our catalog of low surface brightness galaxies will ultimately grow to thousands of objects, which span galaxy morphologies, gas fractions, and halo environments. We will characterize the globular cluster populations for hundreds of these systems, using spectroscopic follow-up for a subset of objects to shed light on the utility of the GCLF as a distance indicator for diffuse galaxies in the LSST era., We present optical long-slit spectroscopy and far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting of two diffuse dwarf galaxies, LSBG-285 and LSBG-750, which were recently discovered by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure redshifts using Hα line emission and find that these galaxies are at comoving distances of ≈25 and ≈41 Mpc, respectively, after correcting for the local velocity field. They have effective radii of r <SUB>eff</SUB> = 1.2 and 1.8 kpc and stellar masses of M <SUB>⋆</SUB> ≈ (2-3) × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. There are no massive galaxies ({M}<SUB>\star </SUB>&gt; {10}<SUP>10</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>) within a comoving separation of at least 1.5 Mpc from LSBG-285 and 2 Mpc from LSBG-750. These sources are similar in size and surface brightness to ultradiffuse galaxies, except they are isolated, star-forming objects that were optically selected in an environmentally blind survey. Both galaxies likely have low stellar metallicities [Z <SUB>⋆</SUB>/Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>] &lt; -1.0 and are consistent with the stellar mass-metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies. We set an upper limit on LSBG-750's rotational velocity of ∼50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is comparable to dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass with estimated halo masses &lt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find tentative evidence that the gas-phase metallicities in both of these diffuse systems are high for their stellar mass, though a statistically complete, optically selected galaxy sample at very low surface brightness will be necessary to place these results into context with the higher surface brightness galaxy population., We present a catalog of extended low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) identified in the Wide layer of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using the first ∼200 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the survey, we have uncovered 781 LSBGs, spanning red (g - i ≥ 0.64) and blue (g - i &lt; 0.64) colors and a wide range of morphologies. Since we focus on extended galaxies (r <SUB>eff</SUB> = 2.″5-14″), our sample is likely dominated by low-redshift objects. We define LSBGs to have mean surface brightnesses {\bar{μ }}<SUB>eff</SUB>}(g)&gt; 24.3 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>, which allows nucleated galaxies into our sample. As a result, the central surface brightness distribution spans a wide range of μ <SUB>0</SUB>(g) = 18-27.4 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>, with 50% and 95% of galaxies fainter than 24.3 and 22 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>, respectively. Furthermore, the surface brightness distribution is a strong function of color, with the red distribution being much broader and generally fainter than that of the blue LSBGs, and this trend shows a clear correlation with galaxy morphology. Red LSBGs typically have smooth light profiles that are well characterized by single-component Sérsic functions. In contrast, blue LSBGs tend to have irregular morphologies and show evidence for ongoing star formation. We cross-match our sample with existing optical, H I, and ultraviolet catalogs to gain insight into the physical nature of the LSBGs. We find that our sample is diverse, ranging from dwarf spheroidals and ultradiffuse galaxies in nearby groups to gas-rich irregulars to giant LSB spirals, demonstrating the potential of the HSC-SSP to provide a truly unprecedented view of the LSBG population., , We report the discovery of a diffuse stellar cloud with an angular extent ≳30″, which we term ""Sumo Puff"", in data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). While we do not have a redshift for this object, it is in close angular proximity to a post-merger galaxy at redshift z = 0.0431 and is projected within a few virial radii (assuming similar redshifts) of two other ∼L<SUB>⋆</SUB> galaxies, which we use to bracket a potential redshift range of 0.0055 &lt; z &lt; 0.0431. The object's light distribution is flat, as characterized by a low Sérsic index (n ∼ 0.3). It has a low central g-band surface brightness of ∼26.4 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>, large effective radius of ∼13″ (∼11 kpc at z = 0.0431 and ∼1.5 kpc at z = 0.0055), and an elongated morphology (b/a ∼ 0.4). Its red color (g - i ∼ 1) is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population and similar to the nearby post-merger galaxy, and we may see tidal material connecting Sumo Puff with this galaxy. We offer two possible interpretations for the nature of this object: (1) it is an extreme, galaxy-sized tidal feature associated with a recent merger event, or (2) it is a foreground dwarf galaxy with properties consistent with a quenched, disturbed, ultra-diffuse galaxy. We present a qualitative comparison with simulations that demonstrates the feasibility of forming a structure similar to this object in a merger event. Follow-up spectroscopy and/or deeper imaging to confirm the presence of the bridge of tidal material will be necessary to reveal the true nature of this object., Interest in ultra-low-surface brightness galaxies has been reignited by the discovery of a substantial population of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in dense clusters. These galaxies are characterized by dwarf-like stellar masses spread across giant-galaxy sizes, and their prolonged survival in clusters suggests that they may be extremely dark-matter dominated. The dark matter halos of a handful of UDGs in dense clusters have been weighed by the detection of rich globular cluster (GC) systems ( 20-100 GCs), and indeed, their inferred mass-to-light ratios (M/L &gt; 1000) are unprecedented for their stellar masses. More recently, galaxies with UDG-like properties have been discovered in much lower-density environments. However, the connection between UDGs across the full range of halo environments remains uncertain. Do extreme mass-to-light ratios persist throughout this population regardless of environment? Or, is this a unique characteristic of UDGs in galaxy clusters? Thanks to the depth and wide-area coverage afforded by our ongoing Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, we are carrying out the first truly blind search for UDGs to address this question. We currently have a sample of 300 UDG candidates in environments ranging from the field to intermediate-mass groups. We propose to use ACS/WFC imaging to study the GC systems of 10 UDGs selected for their association with poor groups that span a range in environment a factor of 10 to 100 less dense than Coma. Our program has the potential, for the first time, to establish a connection between the extremely dark-matter dominated UDGs in dense galaxy clusters and those being discovered in much lower-density environments., The recovery of an exoplanet’s atmospheric parameters from its spectrum requires accurate knowledge of the spectral errors and covariances. Unfortunately, the complex image processing used in high-contrast integral-field spectrograph (IFS) observations generally produces spectral covariances that are poorly understood and often ignored. In this work, we show how to measure the spectral errors and covariances and include them self-consistently in parameter retrievals. By combining model exoplanet spectra with a realistic noise model generated from the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) early science data, we show that ignoring spectral covariance in high-contrast IFS data can both bias inferred parameters and lead to unreliable confidence regions on those parameters. This problem is made worse by the common practice of scaling the χ <SUP>2</SUP> per degree of freedom to unity; the input parameters then fall outside the 95% confidence regions in as many as ∼80% of noise realizations. The biases we observe can approach the typical levels of precision achieved in high-contrast spectroscopy. Accounting for realistic priors in fully Bayesian retrievals can also have a significant impact on the inferred parameters. Plausible priors on effective temperature and surface gravity can vary by an order of magnitude across the confidence regions appropriate for objects with weak age constraints; priors for objects with good age constraints are dominated by modeling uncertainties. Our methods are directly applicable to existing high-contrast IFSs including GPI and SPHERE, as well as upcoming instruments like CHARIS and, ultimately, WFIRST-AFTA., Motivated by the possibility that a coronagraph will be put on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)/Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (AFTA), we explore the direct detectability of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) in the optical. We quantify a planet's detectability by the fraction of its orbit for which it is in an observable configuration ({f}<SUB>{obs</SUB>}). Using a suite of Monte Carlo experiments, we study the dependence of {f}<SUB>{obs</SUB>} upon the inner working angle (IWA) and minimum achievable contrast ({C}<SUB>{min</SUB>}) of the direct-imaging observatory; the planet's phase function, geometric albedo, single-scattering albedo, radius, and distance from Earth; and the semimajor axis distribution of EGPs. We calculate phase functions for a given geometric or single-scattering albedo, assuming various scattering mechanisms. We find that the Lambertian phase function can predict significantly larger {f}<SUB>{obs</SUB>}s with respect to the more realistic Rayleigh phase function. For observations made with WFIRST/AFTA's baseline capabilities ({C}<SUB>{min</SUB>}∼ {10}<SUP>-9</SUP>, {IWA}∼ 0\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 2), Jupiter-like planets orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 pc of Earth have volume-averaged observability fractions of ∼12%, 3%, and 0.5%, respectively. At 10 pc, such observations yield {f}<SUB>{obs</SUB>}\gt 1% for low- to modest-eccentricity planets with semimajor axes in the range ∼2-10 AU. If {C}<SUB>{min</SUB>}={10}<SUP>-10</SUP>, this range extends to ∼35 AU. We find that, in all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for detection in a blind search is low (&lt; 5%). However, with orbital parameter constraints from long-term radial-velocity campaigns and Gaia astrometry, the tools we develop in this work can be used to determine both the most promising systems to target and when to observe them., We use the Planck full mission temperature maps to examine the stacked thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (tSZ) signal of 188,042 “locally brightest galaxies” (LBGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Our LBG sample closely matches that of Planck Collaboration XI (PCXI), but our analysis differs in several ways. We work directly in terms of physically observable quantities, requiring minimal assumptions about the gas pressure profile. We explicitly model the dust emission from each LBG and simultaneously measure both the stacked tSZ and dust signals as a function of stellar mass {M}<SUB>*</SUB>. There is a small residual bias in stacked tSZ measurements; we measure this bias and subtract it from our results, finding that the effects are non-negligible at the lowest masses in the LBG sample. Finally, we compare our measurements with two pressure profile models, finding that the profile from Battaglia et al. provides a better fit to the results than the Arnaud et al. “universal pressure profile.” However, within the uncertainties, we find that the data are consistent with a self-similar scaling with mass—more precise measurements are needed to detect the relatively small deviations from self-similarity predicted by these models. Consistent with PCXI, we measure the stacked tSZ signal from LBGs with stellar masses down to {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({M}<SUB>*</SUB>/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>) ∼ 11.1-11.3. For lower stellar masses, however, we do not see evidence for a stacked tSZ signal. We note that the stacked dust emission is comparable to, or larger than, the stacked tSZ signal for {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({M}<SUB>*</SUB>/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>)≲ 11.3. Future tSZ analyses with larger samples and lower noise levels should be able to probe deviations from self-similarity and thus provide constraints on models of feedback and the evolution of hot halo gas over cosmic time., We present a K-band spectroscopic study of the stellar and gas kinematics, mass distribution, and stellar populations of the archetypical starburst galaxy M82. Our results are based on a single spectrum at a position angle of 67fdg5 through the K-band nucleus. We used the <SUP>12</SUP>CO stellar absorption band head at 2.29 μm (CO<SUB>2.29</SUB>) to measure the rotation curve out to nearly 4 kpc radius on both the eastern and western sides of the galaxy. Our data show that the rotation curve is flat from 1 to 4 kpc. This stands in sharp contrast to some previous studies, which have interpreted H I and CO emission-line position-velocity diagrams as evidence for a declining rotation curve. The kinematics of the Brγ, H<SUB>2</SUB>, and He I emission lines are consistent with, although characterized by slightly higher velocities than, the stellar kinematics. We derived M82's mass distribution from our stellar kinematic measurements and estimate that its total dynamical mass is ~10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We measured the equivalent width of CO<SUB>2.29</SUB> (W <SUB>2.29</SUB>) as a function of distance from the center of the galaxy to investigate the spatial extent of the red supergiant (RSG) population. The variation in W <SUB>2.29</SUB> with radius clearly shows that RSGs dominate the light inside 500 pc radius. M82's superwind is likely launched from this region, where we estimate that the enclosed mass is lsim2 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>., M82 is often considered the archetypical starburst galaxy because of its spectacular starbust-driven superwind. Its close proximity of 3.6 Mpc and nearly edge-on geometry make it a unique laboratory for studying the physics of rapid star formation and violent galactic winds. In addition, there is evidence that it has been tidally-truncated by its interaction with M81 and therefore has essentially no dark matter halo. The mass distribution of this galaxy is needed to estimate the power of its superwind, as well as determine if a dark matter halo is still present. Numerous studies have used stellar and gas dynamics to estimate the mass distribution, yet the substantial dust attenuation has been a significant challenge. We have measured the stellar kinematics in the near-infrared K-band with the LUCI-1 spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope. We used the '<SUP>2</SUP>CO stellar absorption bandhead at 2.29µm to measure the stellar rotation curve out to ∼4kpc, and our results confirm that the dark matter halo is still present. This is in stark contrast with the nearly Keplerian gas dynamics measured with HI and CO emission from the interstellar medium. We estimate M82's dynamical mass to be ∼10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We have also measured the equivalent width of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO bandhead to provide new constraints on the spatial extent of the red supergiant population. The variation in the CO equivalent width with radius clearly shows that supergiants dominate the light within 0.5kpc radius. The superwind is likely launched from this region, where we estimate the enclosed mass is 2×10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.","['2022ApJ...941...26G', 'arXiv:2109.13943', '10.3847/1538-4357/ac75b7', '2021arXiv210913943G', '10.48550/arXiv.2109.13943', 'ascl:2110.006', '2021ascl.soft10006G', '10.48550/arXiv.2004.07273', '2021ApJ...908...24G', 'arXiv:2004.07273', '10.3847/1538-4357/abd030', '2020arXiv200407273G', '2020AAS...23544104G', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51580182', '2020yCat..51580182G', '2020AAS...23514802G', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18570104', '2019yCat..18570104G', '2019AAS...23341602G', '10.3847/1538-4357/aae0f4', '2018ApJ...866..112G', '2018arXiv180504118G', 'arXiv:1805.04118', '10.48550/arXiv.1805.04118', '2018ApJ...857..104G', '2017arXiv170904474G', '10.3847/1538-4357/aab842', 'arXiv:1709.04474', '10.48550/arXiv.1709.04474', '2018PhDT.......149G', '2018PASJ...70S..19G', '2017arXiv170406681G', '10.48550/arXiv.1704.06681', '10.1093/pasj/psx051', 'arXiv:1704.06681', '2017hst..prop15277G', '2016arXiv160200691G', '10.48550/arXiv.1602.00691', '2016ApJ...833..134G', 'arXiv:1602.00691', '10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/134', '10.48550/arXiv.1505.07832', '2015arXiv150507832G', 'arXiv:1505.07832', '10.1088/0004-637X/808/2/172', '2015ApJ...808..172G', '10.48550/arXiv.1409.6747', '2014arXiv1409.6747G', '2015ApJ...808..151G', 'arXiv:1409.6747', '10.1088/0004-637X/808/2/151', '10.48550/arXiv.1202.0824', '2012arXiv1202.0824G', '10.1088/0004-637X/757/1/24', 'arXiv:1202.0824', '2012ApJ...757...24G', '2012AAS...21924632G']","[('galaxy', 54), ('stellar', 36), ('mass', 29), ('population', 19), ('low', 19), ('object', 17), ('surface', 15), ('data', 14), ('brightness', 14), ('wide', 13)]","[(('surface', 'brightness'), 14), (('stellar', 'mass'), 13), (('stellar', 'population'), 9), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 8), (('hsc', 'ssp'), 8), (('hyper', 'suprime'), 7), (('suprime', 'cam'), 7), (('dark', 'matter'), 7), (('low', 'surface'), 6), (('cam', 'subaru'), 6)]","[(('hyper', 'suprime', 'cam'), 7), (('low', 'surface', 'brightness'), 6), (('suprime', 'cam', 'subaru'), 6), (('cam', 'subaru', 'strategic'), 5), (('subaru', 'strategic', 'program'), 5), (('strategic', 'program', 'hsc'), 5), (('program', 'hsc', 'ssp'), 5), (('surface', 'brightness', 'galaxies'), 4), (('stacked', 'tsz', 'signal'), 3), (('dark', 'matter', 'halo'), 3)]",Dirty

We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of <inline-formula> </inline-formula> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a cooling age of ~400 Myr. This requires a WD progenitor of ~3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, significantly larger than the current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We suggest the WD progenitor star formed several hundred megayears ago via the merger of two stars near the turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL. The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common envelope in the future and thus could result in a short-period double WD binary or merger of a 0.72 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> C/O WD and a 0.38 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> helium WD, making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova., To begin, we take the entire sample of RS CVn variable stars identified in the American Association of Variable Star Observers' (AAVSO) International Variable Star Index (VSX) catalog (Watson+ 2006SASS...25...47W ; see B/vsx). We use the 2021 April version of this catalog. See Section 2.1. <P />We match this sample of 73203 VSX RS CVns to the Gaia EDR3 catalog starting with a 1.4"" searching radius. We find unique Gaia matches for 71463 sources in the VSX catalog and the cuts yield a sample of 22372 stars. See Section 2.2. <P />Out of our original list we select a total of 1723 stars that have well-determined Gaia matches, astrometric solutions, and low-extinction values, which appear to be true RS CVns rather than misclassified MS stars. See Section 2.3. <P />(1 data file)., Many important systems result from mass transfer (MT) in low-mass binaries including double white dwarf (WD) binaries and Type Ia supernovae. A key uncertainty in modeling these systems is whether the MT will be unstable, resulting in a common envelope that dramatically shrinks the binary orbit. In particular, theory suggests that most MT from an RGB donor should be unstable, but observations reveal many systems that challenge this hypothesis. Here we target WOCS 14020, a main sequence-WD binary in open cluster M67. The orbital period of 359 days suggests the system evolved through stable MT from an RGB donor star. WOCS 14020 is uniquely poised to test the limits of MT stability; the primary main-sequence star is one of the lowest mass outcomes of MT in the cluster, and canonical MT models predict MT on to lower mass accretors to be increasingly unstable. We request 10 orbits of COS FUV spectroscopy to measure the WD mass and cooling age in this system, which together define the evolutionary state of the donor star during MT. Further, WOCS 14020's membership in M67 provides many important constraints that are not usually available in modeling post-MT binaries. Together, this will allow us to construct an unusually detailed evolutionary history for WOCS 14020, and explore whether non-conservative mass transfer models yield stable MT evolution and reproduce the observed system. The results will be an important test of whether non-conservative MT models can empirically match the extent of the post-MT population of a benchmark open cluster. The precise WD mass and age measurements required are only possible with FUV spectroscopy, a capability unique to HST., Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) fall below the subgiant branch and/or red of the giant branch, an area of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) not populated by standard stellar evolution tracks. Only 65 SSGs have been identified in the literature, all found in star clusters. These SSGs are short-period binary systems with giant star primaries that are rapidly rotating and magnetically active. One explanation for SSGs is that their strong magnetic fields inhibit convection, creating giants with inflated radii and cooler surface temperatures— a similar effect as is observed in active M-dwarfs. By cross-referencing a catalog of known active giants in the field with Gaia photometry and parallaxes, we can now precisely position a large sample of active giants in a CMD. Out of a sample of 1723 active giants, 448 fall below a 14 Gyr isochrone, classifying them as field SSGs. This result demonstrates that active stars often evolve to be much redder and fainter giants than predicted by standard models. I will discuss the rotation period and CMD distributions of this new SSG population, and what these teach us about the interplay between rotation, magnetic activity, and the evolutionary trajectory of active stars beyond the main sequence., Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) fall below the subgiant branch and/or red of the giant branch in open and globular clusters, an area of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) not populated by standard stellar evolution tracks. One hypothesis is that SSGs result from rapid rotation in subgiants or giants due to tidal synchronization in a close binary. The strong magnetic fields generated inhibit convection, which in turn produces large starspots, radius inflation, and lower-than-expected average surface temperatures and luminosities. Here we cross-reference a catalog of active giant binaries (RS CVns) in the field with Gaia EDR3. Using the Gaia photometry and parallaxes, we precisely position the RS CVns in a CMD. We identify stars that fall below a 14 Gyr, metal-rich isochrone as candidate field SSGs. Out of a sample of 1723 RS CVn, we find 448 SSG candidates, a dramatic expansion from the 65 SSGs previously known. Most SSGs have rotation periods of 2-20 days, with the highest SSG fraction found among RS CVn with the shortest periods. The ubiquity of SSGs among this population indicates that SSGs are a normal phase in evolution for RS CVn-type systems, not rare by-products of dynamical encounters found only in dense star clusters as some have suggested. We present our catalog of 1723 active giants, including Gaia photometry and astrometry, and rotation periods from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and International Variable Star Index (VSX). This catalog can serve as an important sample to study the impacts of magnetic fields in evolved stars., We use photometry and proper motions from Gaia DR2 to determine the blue straggler star (BSS) populations of 16 old (1-10 Gyr), nearby (d &lt; 3500 pc) open clusters. We find that the fractional number of BSS compared to red giant branch stars increases with age, starting near zero at 1 Gyr and flattening to ∼0.35 by 4 Gyr. Fitting stellar evolutionary tracks to these BSSs, we find that their mass distribution peaks at a few tenths of a solar mass above the main-sequence turnoff. BSSs more than 0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> above the turnoff make up only ∼25% of the sample, and BSSs more than 1.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> above the turnoff are rare. We compare this to Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code population synthesis models of BSSs formed via mass transfer. We find that standard population synthesis assumptions dramatically under-produce the number of BSS in old open clusters. We also find that these models overproduce high-mass BSSs relative to lower-mass BSSs. The expected number of BSSs formed through dynamics do not fully account for this discrepancy. We conclude that in order to explain the observed BSS populations from Roche lobe overflow, mass transfer from giant donors must be more stable than assumed in canonical mass-transfer prescriptions, and including nonconservative mass transfer is important in producing realistic BSS masses. Even with these modifications, it is difficult to achieve the large number of BSSs observed in the oldest open clusters. We discuss some additional physics that may explain the large number of observed blue stragglers among old stellar populations., Recent HST/COS UV spectroscopy of white dwarf companions to two blue straggler stars in the old (6 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 have yielded precise measurements of the white dwarf masses and ages. These measurements show definitively that these blue straggler stars formed from mass transfer from an evolved binary companion. These new measurements, combined with the stars' membership in a well-studied open cluster, and long-term radial-velocity monitoring, provide excellent constraints on the stellar and orbital parameters of these post-mass-transfer systems. Here we present formation models for these two systems based on a grid of accretion models from the stellar evolution code MESA. These models show that one system, WOCS 4540, likely resulted from stable mass transfer from an AGB donor. This evolutionary scenario is generally consistent with expectations from recent blue straggler studies, though its non-zero orbital eccentricity is a challenge to explain theoretically. The other system, WOCS 5379, appears to have resulted from mass transfer from an RGB donor, but its blue color, 120-day orbital period, and non-zero orbital eccentricity make it difficult to explain using the standard assumptions of binary evolution theory. Both systems demonstrate the value of using detailed analysis to test our understanding of binary evolution processes., At an age of 4 Gyr, typical solar-type stars in M67 have rotation rates of 20-30 days. Using K2 Campaign 5 and 16 light curves and the spectral archive of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we identify 11 3D kinematic members of M67 with anomalously fast rotation periods of 2-8 days, implying ages of less than 1 Gyr. We hypothesize that these anomalously fast rotators have been spun up by mass transfer, mergers, or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters within the 1 Gyr and thus represent lower-luminosity counterparts to the blue straggler stars. These 11 candidate post-interaction stellar systems have much in common with the blue stragglers, including a high binary fraction (73%); a number of long-period, low-eccentricity binary systems; and in at least one case a UV excess consistent with the presence of a hot white dwarf companion. The identification of these 11 systems provides the first picture of the low-luminosity end of the blue straggler distribution, providing new constraints for detailed binary evolution models and cluster population studies. This result also clearly demonstrates the need to properly account for the impact of binaries on stellar evolution, as significant numbers of post-interaction binaries likely exist on cluster main sequences and in the field. These stars are not always easy to identify but make up ∼10% or more of the spectroscopic binary population among the solar-type stars in M67., Theory predicts that blue stragglers and other mass-transfer products are born with rapid rotation rates, but little work has been done to understand the angular momentum evolution of these stars as they age. Here we present an observational study of post-mass-transfer angular momentum evolution in these systems. For a sample of known post-mass-transfer binaries, we present rotation periods from v sini measurements or photometric spot modulation, and ages from white dwarf cooling models. This sample includes F-type blue stragglers in the cluster NGC 188 and post-mass-transfer FGK main-sequence stars in the field, all wide binaries (88 &lt; Porb &lt; 3030 days) with white dwarf companions. Within several Myr of formation these systems are rotating at a significant fraction of break-up velocity. They then spin down as they age. Strikingly, the spin-down rate agrees with spin-down models developed for standard solar-type main-sequence stars. We suggest that spin-down in post-mass-transfer stars is physically similar to the typical spin-down behavior observed in single main-sequence stars and can be described by the same magnetic braking prescriptions. Critically, this opens up the possibility of using gyrochronology to determine the time since formation of blue straggler stars and other post-mass-transfer binaries, and to detect hidden populations of post-mass-transfer binaries in clusters based on their anomalously fast rotation rates. The authors acknowledge funding support from NSF AST- 1714506, NSF AST-1801937 and NASA-NNX15AW69G, Blue stragglers and other mass transfer/collision products are likely born with rapid rotation rates due to angular momentum transfer during mass-transfer, merger, or collisional formation. However, less is known about the angular momentum evolution of these stars as they age. Here we compare rotation rates and post-formation ages of mass-transfer products to models of angular momentum evolution for normal main-sequence (MS) stars and collisionally formed blue stragglers. In our sample, we include both F- and G-type blue stragglers in the cluster NGC 188 and post-mass-transfer GK MS stars in the field, all binaries with white dwarf (WD) companions. We compare ages derived from WD cooling models to photometric rotation periods and/or spectral v sin i measurements. We demonstrate that these systems have rapid rotation rates soon after formation. They then spin down as they age, much like standard solar-type MS stars do. We discuss the physical implications of this result, which suggests that the spin-down of post-mass transfer stars can be described by standard magnetic-braking prescriptions. This opens up the possibility of using gyrochronology as a method to determine the time since formation of blue straggler stars and other post-mass-transfer binaries., Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of open clusters reveal many stars that do not fall on standard isochrones, and thus are not evolving according to standard theory. The most numerous of these are the blue straggler stars (BSSs), stars brighter and bluer than the cluster turnoff that are likely formed from binary mass transfer, stellar mergers, or collisions during dynamical encounters. Many other non-standard stars are also found in fclusters, but their origins are not well understood. These include the 'yellow stragglers' found between the BSS region and the red giant branch, and 'sub-subgiants' found fainter and redder than the giant branch. Using the 4 Gyr open cluster M67 as an exemplar, I present results of the first comprehensive study to move beyond the BSS population and begin to understand these other types of non-standard stars. First, I present an asteroseismic analysis of a yellow straggler in M67, demonstrating that it is an evolved blue straggler star of twice the cluster turnoff mass. Next, I present theoretical formation models for the sub-subgiant stars. I focus on three hypotheses of sub-subgiant formation: Roche lobe overflow in binary systems, rapid envelope mass loss from subgiant stars, e.g. during grazing dynamical encounters, and inhibition of convection in giant stars with strong magnetic fields. Finally, I use K2 light curves to identify stars on the M67 main sequence with unusually fast rotation rates given the old age of the cluster. I hypothesize that these stars have been spun up due to recent mergers, collisions, or episodes of mass-transfer, and thus represent lower-luminosity analogs to the blue stragglers. Together, these studies present a much more complete view of the post-merger, collision, and mass-transfer population of M67, and demonstrate that BSSs account for only about half of the post-interaction population. These stars represent the early stages of binary evolution pathways that may lead to many astrophysically important objects including X-ray binaries, double degenerates, and Type 1a supernovae. Studying these products of binary evolution across cluster CMDs is a critical step towards developing better models of binary evolutionary pathways and understanding the impact of binaries on stellar populations., Optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of open clusters reveal large populations of stars that do not fall along standard isochrones, and thus are not evolving according to standard theory. The most numerous of these stars are the blue stragglers, stars brighter and bluer than the cluster turnoff that are likely formed from mass transfer in a binary, stellar mergers, or collisions during dynamical encounters. The origins of other non-standard stars are not well understood, including the “yellow stragglers” found between the blue straggler region and the red giant branch, and “sub-subgiants” found fainter and redder than the giant branch. Understanding the formation and evolution of these non-standard stars is critical to properly modeling galactic stellar populations and revealing the binary evolution channels that form exotic end products like X-ray binaries, double degenerates, and Type 1a supernovae. In this talk I will present results of the first asteroseismic study of a yellow straggler in the old open cluster M67. This study shows the yellow straggler to be a red clump giant with a mass of at least twice the turnoff mass of M67, suggesting it is an evolved blue straggler formed from a merger or collision. I will also discuss the observed properties of the growing population of sub-subgiants discovered in open and globular clusters, and present models describing three possible formation pathways for these stars: mass-transfer in a binary, rapid envelope mass loss, and inhibition of convection due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. These studies represent some of the first efforts to understand cluster CMD outliers beyond the blue stragglers, and are a critical step forward in understanding binary evolution pathways., , Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) lie to the red of the main sequence and fainter than the red giant branch in cluster color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), a region not easily populated by standard stellar evolution pathways. While there has been speculation on what mechanisms may create these unusual stars, no well-developed theory exists to explain their origins. Here we discuss three hypotheses of SSG formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2) stripping of a subgiant’s envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and (3) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective efficiency and produce large starspots. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of these mechanisms can create stars or binary systems in the SSG CMD domain. We also calculate the frequency with which each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in open clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in higher mass globular clusters. <P />This is paper number 74 in the WIYN Open Cluster Study., Yellow straggler stars (YSSs) fall above the subgiant branch in optical color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), between the blue stragglers and the red giants. YSSs may represent a population of evolved blue stragglers, but none have the direct and precise mass and radius measurements needed to determine their evolutionary states and formation histories. Here we report the first asteroseismic mass and radius measurements of such a star, the yellow straggler S1237 in the open cluster M67. We apply asteroseismic scaling relations to a frequency analysis of the Kepler K2 light curve and find a mass of 2.9 ± 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a radius of 9.2 ± 0.2 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. This is more than twice the mass of the main-sequence turnoff in M67, suggesting that S1237 is indeed an evolved blue straggler. S1237 is the primary in a spectroscopic binary. We update the binary orbital solution and use spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the CMD location of the secondary star. We find that the secondary is likely an upper main-sequence star near the turnoff, but a slightly hotter blue straggler companion is also possible. We then compare the asteroseismic mass of the primary to its mass from CMD fitting, finding that the photometry implies a mass and radius more than 2σ below the asteroseismic measurement. Finally, we consider formation mechanisms for this star and suggest that S1237 may have formed from dynamical encounters resulting in stellar collisions or a binary merger. <P />This is paper 73 in the WIYN Open Cluster Study., Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) lie red of the main-sequence and fainter than the red giant branch in optical color-magnitude diagrams, a region not easily populated by standard stellar evolution pathways. Discoveries of dozens of SSGs in both open and globular clusters solidifies these stars as a unique class sharing several properties: X-ray emission, photometric variability, and, where binary status is known, orbital periods between 2-18 days.While there has been speculation on what mechanisms may create these unusual stars, no theory has yet been developed to explain their origins. Here we focus on three hypotheses of SSG formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2) tidally induced mass loss from a subgiant star during a dynamical encounter, and (3) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective efficiency and produce large star spots.Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with the six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. We calculate the frequency with which each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open clusters. Mass transfer and dynamical encounters may also create SSGs, but have lower expected formation frequencies. They may be more important mechanisms in globular clusters with higher encounter rates and larger populations of subgiants., In this second paper (see also Geller et al. 2010, cat. J/AJ/139/1383) in a series studying the dynamical state of the young (150Myr) open cluster M35 we present an updated version of our complete radial velocity database for the cluster. Our sample is selected to cover the range of the M35 main sequence from 0.8 to 1.6M<SUB>ȯ</SUB> out to 30' from cluster center. In the 17 years that we have observed M35, we have gathered ~8000 moderate-precision (σ<SUB>i</SUB>=0.5km/s) spectra of ~1300 stars. We find 418 of these to be confirmed radial velocity cluster members or likely members. Within our sample of 418 cluster members or likely members, we detect 64 velocity-variable stars. We present orbital solutions for 52 (see Tables 5 and 7) of these 64 systems, in addition to 28 (see Tables 6 and 8) completed orbital solutions for non-member binaries in our field of view. <P />The binaries are drawn from a sample initially derived from the photometry of T. von Hippel taken at KPNO on the Burrell Schmidt telescope. Observations were taken on 1993 November 18-19, and include B and V photometry down to a magnitude of V=17 lying within a 70'*70' field of view. Subsequently, we updated this photometry for 74% of our sources with more precise BV photometry from C. P. Deliyannis (2006, private communication; Sarrazine et al., 2000AAS...197.4107S). This new photometry was taken on the WIYN 0.9m telescope with the S2KB imager and covers a 40'*40' field of view. See Geller et al. 2010 (cat. J/AJ/139/1383) for more information on these two sets of photometry. <P />Beginning in 1997 September, we have obtained spectra for the stars in our sample at the WIYN 3.5m telescope at KPNO using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS). For a detailed description of our observing and data reduction procedure see Geller et al. 2008 (cat. J/AJ/135/2264). In short, we typically use Hydra's blue sensitive fibers and an echelle grating providing a resolution of R~20000. These spectra are centered on 512.5nm, and span a ~25nm wavelength range, covering several prominent absorption lines including the MgB triplet. We present here all radial velocity measurements of the 1355 stars in our sample to date (see Table4), totaling ~8000 radial velocities (see Table3). <P />M35 was observed in the X-ray by the XMM-Newton orbiting observatory for 8.6ks (02:37:10-05:00:50 UT) on 2008 September 20. The telescope boresight location was 6<SUP>h</SUP>8<SUP>m</SUP>54<SUP>s</SUP>, +24°20'00'' (J2000). The XMM field of view with r=15' does not extend as far from cluster center as the WOCS radial velocity survey (r=30', α=06<SUP>h</SUP>09<SUP>m</SUP>07.5<SUP>s</SUP>, δ=+24°20'28''). We cross-correlate the position of each X-ray source with the WOCS catalog to find potential optical counterparts to the X-ray sources (see Table9). <P />(7 data files)., The young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 (NGC 2168) has been one of the core clusters of the WIYN Open Cluster Study since 1997. Over these 17 years we have obtained approximately 8000 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of stars in the M35 field, which we provide here. Our target sample consists of 1355 photometrically selected stars in the field of M35 within the main sequence and binary sequence of the cluster and within 13≤slant V≤slant 16.5 and (B-V)≥slant 0.6. Using our RV measurements we cleanly separate likely cluster members from field stars. We calculate RV membership probabilities for over 1200 stars in our sample. 418 are probable cluster members, of which 64 are velocity-variable (binary) systems. Here we present 52 orbital solutions for binary members of M35. This sample defines the hard binary population of M35 that dynamically powers the cluster. We also present XMM-Newton X-ray detections within the cluster. We use our large binary sample to search for interacting binaries among the X-ray sources, investigate M35's period-eccentricity distribution, and determine binary frequency. We find a circularization period of 9.9 ± 1.2 days and a binary frequency of 24% ± 3% for main-sequence binaries with P\lt {10}<SUP>4</SUP> days. Determining these properties in a young cluster like M35 is key to defining the initial conditions used in models of cluster dynamical evolution., , The young (150 Myr) open cluster M35 has been one of the core clusters of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) since 1997. Over these 15 years we have obtained nearly 8000 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of stars in the M35 field. Our target sample consists of 1355 photometrically selected stars in the field of M35 within the main sequence and binary sequence of the cluster with 13 &lt; V &lt; 16.5 and (B-V) &gt; 0.6. It also includes a few X-ray sources revealed in XMM-Newton observations. Using our RV measurements we have been able to adequately separate likely cluster members from field stars. We have RV membership probabilities for over 1200 stars in our sample, over 400 of which are probable cluster members. Our survey has also revealed 240 velocity-variable stars. Here we present more than 50 orbital solutions of variable cluster members. This sample defines the hard binary population of M35 that dynamically powers the cluster, and enables us to investigate important properties such as the period-eccentricity distribution, binary frequency, and the secondary mass distribution of M35. Understanding these properties in a young cluster is key to defining the initial conditions used in models of cluster dynamical evolution.

In the outer solar system pit chains are most clearly observed on Enceladus. In this paper, we test three techniques for using pit chain morphometry to probe the regolith thickness across Enceladus accumulated as fall-back from its plume eruptions. We favor the precision of the Slope Angle Method (SAM), allowing for spatially related heterogeneities in regolith characteristics, and we measured regolith thicknesses up to 700 m (mean = 250 m, n = 116). We combine models of plume deposition rates with observed regolith thicknesses and assume lunar-like crater-generated regolith production. We constrain the time needed to deposit the observed sequences of regolith to extrapolate the age of the plume source and its liquid reservoir. The porosity and density of the plume-generated regolith are unconstrained parameters that affect the rate at which the regolith is deposited. Assuming a constant deposition mass flux, we explored the parameter space of regolith density (0.02-0.92 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>) and porosity (0-90%) that would deposit a thick enough regolith to match the pit chain observations. Only by using the lowest density (0.2 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>) and highest porosity (90%) are we able to reproduce the maximum regolith thicknesses within the age of the solar system. We interpret the long deposition times needed to match regolith thicknesses to suggest that Enceladus's mass flux from the plume needs to have been significantly higher, that the regolith is possibly a low-density/high-porosity material, and/or additional regolith-forming processes (like alternative vent localities) exist, or have existed., Ocean worlds evolve / Dione as endmember / Global SIM progress., Evidence of significant extension on the Moon is associated with nearside mare. The load induced by the mare basalts resulted in lithospheric flexure and graben forming extension. We use high-resolution topographic and image data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the SELenological and ENngineering Explorer (SELENE) to generate detailed fault displacement-length (D/L) scaling observations for graben bounding normal faults. Specifically, we focus on the D<SUB>max</SUB>/L relations of graben within three geologic settings: lunar highlands, mare, and mixed highlands-mare terrains. The population scaling factor γ for the measured lunar graben is 4.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> (n = 50), falling within the range for terrestrial normal faults. The scatter in the D<SUB>max</SUB>/L data for mare graben (γ = 4.9 × 10<SUP>-3,</SUP>n = 25) is significantly higher than that for graben in highlands (γ = 6.3 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, n = 16) and mixed terrains (γ = 3.0 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, n = 9). The shape of a displacement profiles for faults is indicative of the mode of growth (i.e., restricted or unrestricted). Displacement plots show 52% of mare graben exhibit plateau-shaped profiles, indicating restricted fault growth, compared to 19% and 33% for highlands and mixed terrain graben, respectively. We attribute the large percentage of plateau-shaped profiles and the scatter in mare graben D<SUB>max</SUB>/L data to restricted fault growth controlled by the local thickness of the mare basalts. Finally, we consider whether observationally based estimates of the distribution of mare basalt thicknesses is consistent with the width-depth relation of the inferred restricted graben., Triton, Dione/ Maps of ocean worlds are cool/ updates on progress., As the population of Earth's orbital environment and human exploration of space intensifies, it is critical to have a strong ethical framework in place so that mistakes of the past are learned from and not repeated., Codes to reprocess all data and reproduce all Figures of ""Observed mixing at Maud Rise, Weddell Sea"".

These structures are long (10s 100s km), narrow (1-10 km), bright streaks with an equatorial-parallel distribution that we term linear virgae (Martin &amp; Patthoff, 2018). Wherever these features are observed, they appear to cross cut all other structures suggesting they are some of the youngest features on Dione. Diones linear virgae are proposed to form most likely from an exogenic mechanism emplacing material across the surface sourced from either Saturns rings, co-orbital moons, or an encounter with planetocentric debris. Regardless of which of these three sources is the most likely, it is unclear whether the formation of linear virgae has occurred system wide, or if it is specific to Dione. We have identified similar linear virgae-like structures on Rhea; however, those have a distribution and orientation unlike those on observed on Dione. This suggests Rheas linear virgae-like structures could have a differing formation mechanism than those on Dione. We aim to better understand whether linear virgae are unique to Dione or may be more broadly distributed across the Saturnian system. We will present a constraint on the geographic distribution of linear virgae across the Saturnian system and catalog the viewing conditions in which they are likely to be detected. We aim to better understand if there are biases in the Cassini data sets that may influence the detection of linear virgae across the Saturn system. We will also produce a catalog of morphometric characterizations of linear virgae where they are detected. Elucidating the origin of linear virgae will enhance our understanding of the most recent exogenic activity on the mid-sized icy satellites, including the delivery of exogenic materials to the surfaces of icy worlds.

This work is being carried out using public data from large area optical surveys such as DES and PANStarrs. We focus on a search for g-band emission as an analogue to terrestrial bioluminiscence. The amount of bioluminiscent molecules in the photospheres of Y dwarfs is constrained by the optical to mid infrared colors. Future plans to extend this search using current telescopic facilities and upcoming surveys such as Euclid and Vera Rubin LSST are discussed., , Graben are a common tectonic landform associated with lunar mare. These graben are hypothesized to have formed either due to subsidence induced flexure resulting from loading of the lithosphere by mare basalt (mascon tectonics) or by dikes related to intrusive volcanism. High-resolution topography derived from data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and SELenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) allow for the detailed analysis of flat-floored mare-radial and mare-concentric graben. Modeling of graben formation from dike-induced dilation predicts rises on graben flanks that decay in relief with distance from the central trough. Graben formation from passive extensional stresses are not expected to produce discernable flank rises. We take a systematic approach to assessing morphology of flat-floored graben in mascon and non-mascon mare settings. Modeling of dilation effects due to intrusion of dikes of realistic dimension and depth indicate that the predicted relief of flank rises are at or below the limits of detection using best available topography. However, it is concluded that the lack of evidence of flank rises indicates nearside graben formed by passive extension. The presence of graben in both mascon (e.g., Mare Humorum) and non-mascon settings (e.g., Oceanus Procellarum) suggests that flexure and extension are strongly influenced by the local thickness and/or strength of the mechanical lithosphere., The nearside mare are closely associated with concentric and radial graben frequently attributed to mascon tectonics. Previous work suggests that in the cases of mare not associated with mascons, the loading of the basalt on a thinner or weaker lithosphere may be sufficient to produce graben comparable to mascon mare. To assess whether there are sufficient loads to induce lithospheric flexure we must first understand the spatial distribution and variability of mare basalt thickness. Thus, an accurate assessment of the thickness is critical to constraining stresses from loading by mare basalts on the lunar lithosphere. <P />The thicknesses of mare basalt on the nearside has been the focus of myriad studies, employing various techniques including the use of ghost craters to estimate the minimum basalt fill. We aim to better understand the controls on mare localized graben formation by using graben as a means of inferring the minimum depth of the brittle basalt sequence in which they formed. In the case of a simple graben made up of two antithetic normal faults, the graben width is related to the depth of convergence of the faults and is often controlled by the depth to a mechanical discontinuity. For graben in mare basalts, this convergence depth may be to an interbed in lava flow sequence or more likely the contact between the basalt sequence and the highlands substrate. Thus, assuming a simple graben made of two 60° dipping faults, the depth where the normal faults intersect should represent a local minimum estimate of the thickness of the mare basalts. <P />We find graben widths in mare range from ~400 m to ~5 km with a mean of ~2 km. This corresponds to a mean convergence depth of ~1.7 km. If our assumption that fault convergence depths represent a minimum mare basalt depth, 1.7 km is significantly larger than previous estimates based on depth-diameter relations of buried impact craters., On Enceladus, pit chains are observed primarily within the cratered terrains on the Saturnian and Anti-saturnian hemispheres. Tectonically formed pit chains have been used to signal the presence of loose, unconsolidated material we refer to as regolith. Regolith deposited on Enceladus may have originated from three different sources: 1) impact craters, 2) plume fall-back, 3) deposition of E ring material. Regolith thicknesses are likely to vary spatially across Enceladus due to variations in jet localities, eruption directionality, and preservation of like impact crater-generated regolith. <P />We have adapted a technique for inferring the volume of individual pits into a tool for inferring the minimum depth of the regolith in which that pit forms. Using the pit diameter, length of shadow inside the pit and the sun angle, we can infer the depth of an individual pit. The pit depth is therefore the assumed depth of the regolith it forms in: this is a minimum estimate because we cannot know whether the pit extends to the base of the regolith. <P />We present an updated global map of the distribution of pit chains across the surface of Enceladus, as well a map of where we have measured the depth of the regolith from individual pits. We find that regolith depths across the surface of Enceladus range from 80 meters to ~1 km. The median regolith depth is approximately 400 m which could take as little as 400,000 years or as many as 4 Ga to deposit, depending on the modeled deposition rate at a given location. <P />We present updated and refined estimates of regolith depths including estimates that consider the contribution of impact generated regolith. We also present refined estimates of the time needed for the deposition plume-generated regolith, which will constrain a lower-limit on the age of plume activity., Exoplanets are abundant in our galaxy and yet characterizing them remains a technical challenge. Solar System planets provide an opportunity to test the practical limitations of exoplanet observations with high signal-to-noise data that we cannot access for exoplanets. However, data on Solar System planets differ from exoplanets in that Solar System planets are spatially resolved while exoplanets are unresolved point-sources. We present a novel instrument designed to observe Solar System planets as though they are exoplanets, the Planet as Exoplanet Analog Spectrograph (PEAS). PEAS consists of a dedicated 0.5-m telescope and off-the-shelf optics, located at Lick Observatory. PEAS uses an integrating sphere to disk-integrate light from the Solar System planets, producing spatially mixed light more similar to the spectra we can obtain from exoplanets. This paper describes the general system design and early results of the PEAS instrument., List of member candidates of Coma Ber with UKIDSS GCG DR9 (Cat. II/319/), Pan-STARR DR1 (Cat.

The first version of this catalog was published in 2010, including 829 guide star entries identified at optical wavelengths during the first 10 years of the Chandra mission. Of these 587 were classified as definitely variable and 242 suspected to be variable. Of the definite variable star entries, 319 were previously unidentified. Version 2 includes 1347 entries from the first 18 years of the Chandra mission, of which 216 are newly discovered variables. The variable guide stars are identified from light curves from the Aspect Camera onboard Chandra, which is sensitive to 4000-9000 A and has been sufficiently photometrically stable to allow analysis of multiple light curves throughout the mission. Guide stars used for Chandra operations are usually 6th to 10th magnitude and may be observed continuously for up to two days, as well as multiple times. We analyze the properties of the new VGUIDE catalog with respect to spectral type and variable type, and show examples of discovery light curves., This catalogue includes Spitzer photometry for 27 objects, including preliminary parallaxes for 19 Y dwarfs and 3 late-T dwarfs from the Spitzer parallax program (PI: Kirkpatrick, aiming to measure distances to all of the nearby late-T and Y dwarfs within 20pc that are not being covered by ground-based astrometric monitoring). The Spitzer observations are obtained with the with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) channel 2, and they cover baselines of ~2-7years. <P />Besides, near-infrared images of WISE 0336-0143, WISE0550-1950, WISE0615+1526, WISE 0642+0423, WISE 1055-1652, WISE 1220+5407, and WISE 2203+4619 were obtained using the WIRC on the 200 inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory on 2012 January 4 (WISE 0336-0143, WISE 1055-1652), 2014 March 7 (WISE 2203+4619) and 2016 February 26 (WISE 0550-1950, WISE 0615+1526, WISE 0642+0423, WISE 1220+5407). WIRC has a pixel scale of 0.2487""/pixel providing a total field of view of 8.7"". For each object, fifteen 2-minute images were obtained in the J filter (30 minutes total exposure time). <P />The catalogue also includes spectral types of four targets from the original Spitzer Parallax Program with unknown or uncertain spectral types: WISE 0336-0143, WISE 1051-2138, WISE 1055-1652, and WISE 1318-1758. These types were obtained using J-band spectroscopic observations (R~1500) at the NIRSPEC instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory (see section 3.2 for further details). <P />(6 data files)., The coldest brown dwarfs, late-T and Y dwarfs, are testbeds for atmospheric studies of the extremely cold atmospheres of free-floating planetary-mass objects and provide insights into the lowest mass end of the star formation process. Using Spitzer/IRAC imaging, we present new and updated parallaxes for &gt;140 late-T and Y dwarfs in the nearest 20 pc (Martin et al. 2018, Kirkpatrick et al. 2019). In this talk, I will present an updated understanding of the physical properties of the coldest brown dwarfs based on these parallaxes. I will also present a new look at the substellar field mass function, which shows that the star formation process does not have a physical cut-off at the deuterium burning limit, and if a low-mass cut-off exists, it is likely below 5 Jupiter masses. Finally, I will present the first-ever Keck/NIRES spectra of Y dwarfs; the highest resolution near-infrared spectra of Y dwarfs to date (Martin et al, in prep). These spectra combined with our new parallaxes give us a detailed look at the coldest, free-floating, planetary mass objects., We present updates to the new Triton USGS SIM., Looking at cold moons / Thick snow on Enceladus? / Iceland pits will help., We evaluate two mechanisms for producing basin-centric graben on the Moon: (1) Extension due to lithospheric flexure, or (2) shallow-dike-induced dilation., Tectonic structures can be used to probe the evolution of the stress state of planetary bodies. Similarly, the morphology of individual tectonic structures can be diagnostic of the source of stressed that induced their formation. On the Moon, some of the youngest landforms include lobate scarps that reveal evidence of near-surface contraction. An earlier period of basin localized deformation produced tectonic structures that are radial and concentric to the nearside mare basins. These older features within and proximal to the mare basins include graben and wrinkle ridges that may have been formed by tectonic stresses related to loading by mare basalts. Alternatively, volcanic dike intrusions have been hypothesized to form basin concentric graben. <P />Elucidating the distribution and characteristics of nearside graben is a key component of mare-localized tectonics. An established relationship between the topographic profile of graben and source of stress can be used to determine whether the graben formed as a result of dike intrusion or passive faulting. A graben by the emplacement of a subsurface dike will have prominent flank uplifts that decay with distance away from the central trough while graben formed by passive faulting exhibit little or no flank uplifts. We take a systematic approach to exploring graben around mascon basins and non-mascon mare and make observations of the graben topography assessing their flank uplift morphology for both mascon (Mare Humorum and Mare Serenitatis) and non-mascon (Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Frigoris) basins. <P />Preliminary results show no definitive evidence of dike-related graben associated with either mascon (Humorum and Serenitatis) or non-mascon (Procellarum and Frigoris) basins. The mascon tectonic model proposes that contractional and extensional structures in mascon basins are the result of the accumulation of mare basalts on an impact-thinned and weakened lithosphere that results in load induced subsidence and flexure causing contraction in the interior of the basin and extension near the margins. Our results suggests that graben generated by passive normal faulting in non-mascon tectonic settings are also induced by lithospheric flexure., This study assesses projections from 24 CMIP5 models of number, duration, and severity of pluvial and drought events utilizing 6-month standardized precipitation index. Increased variability of standardized precipitation index is projected globally. More frequent, longer lasting, and stronger pluvials are projected in wet regions, and the same for droughts in dry regions. Worsening pluvials and droughts are most apparent in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and the Americas, respectively. Uniquely, this study investigates pluvials and droughts in locations where the precipitation trend is of the opposite sign. In drying regions, 40% of grid points project an increase in number and 65% project an increase in duration of severe pluvials. Projections for severe drought events in wetting regions show similar projections. As precipitation trends alone do not provide information about pluvial and drought characteristics this study has important implications for planning and resilience., Y dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study free-floating objects with masses &lt;30 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and atmospheric temperatures approaching those of known Jupiter-like exoplanets. Obtaining distances to these objects is an essential step toward characterizing their absolute physical properties. Using Spitzer’s Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) [4.5] images taken over baselines of ∼2-7 years, we measure astrometric distances for 22 late-T and early Y dwarfs, including updated parallaxes for 18 objects and new parallax measurements for 4 objects. These parallaxes will make it possible to explore the physical parameter space occupied by the coldest brown dwarfs. We also present the discovery of six new late-T dwarfs, updated spectra of two T dwarfs, and the reclassification of a new Y dwarf, WISE J033605.04-014351.0, based on Keck/NIRSPEC J-band spectroscopy. Assuming that effective temperatures are inversely proportional to absolute magnitude, we examine trends in the evolution of the spectral energy distributions of brown dwarfs with decreasing effective temperature. Surprisingly, the Y dwarf class encompasses a large range in absolute magnitude in the near- to mid-infrared photometric bandpasses, demonstrating a larger range of effective temperatures than previously assumed. This sample will be ideal for obtaining mid-infrared spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope because their known distances will make it easier to measure absolute physical properties., Our mapping of the wispy terrains on Saturn's moons Dione has revealed unique linear features that are generally long (tens to hundreds of kilometers), narrow (&lt;5 km), and brighter than the surrounding terrains. We refer to these features as linear virgae. Similar features, with a limited distribution, have been observed on Rhea. Wherever linear virgae are observed, they appear to crosscut all other structures suggesting that they are among the youngest features on these satellites. Here we seek to constrain whether the linear virgae are endogenic, suggesting that the surface of Dione has been geologically active recently or if they are exogenic, suggesting a recent, or even ongoing, process in the Saturn system. We favor an exogenic mechanism for the formation of linear virgae on Dione by the emplacement of material across the surface by low-velocity impacts of material sourced from Saturn's rings, co-orbital moons, or encountering planetocentric debris., NIRSPEC is a 1-5 um echelle spectrograph in use on the Keck II Telescope since 1999. The spectrograph is capable of both moderate (R=λ/▵λ 2000) and high (R 25,000) resolution observations and has been a workhorse instrument across many astronomical fields, from planetary science to extragalactic observations. In the latter half of 2018, we will upgrade NIRSPEC to improve the sensitivity and stability of the instrument and increase its lifetime. The major components of the upgrade include replacing the spectrometer and slit-viewing camera detectors with Teledyne H2RG arrays and replacing all transputer-based electronics. We present detailed design, testing, and analysis of the upgraded instrument, including the finalized optomechanical design of the new 1-5 μm slit-viewing camera, detector characterization of the science and Engineering A grade arrays, electronics systems, and updated software design. The optomechanical design of the slit-viewing camera and replacement detector head assembly have both been assembled and cold-tested in our lab. We also show results from the GigE interface to the SAM/ASIC boards to control the H2RG. The upgrade will continue NIRSPEC's legacy as a powerful near-infrared spectrograph behind one of the world's most scientifically productive telescopes., Triton serves as a bridge between KBOs and icy satellites, and characterization of its terrains is important for advancing comparative planetological studies. We aim to create a geologic map of the Neptune-facing side of Triton at a scale of 1:5M., Snow falling on ice / Enceladus is covered / Earth's landscape will help., Preliminary results suggest that non-mascon related graben are tectonic in origin., Advances in infrared technology have been essential towards improving our understanding of the solar neighborhood, revealing a large population of brown dwarfs, which span the mass regime between planets and stars. My thesis combines near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic and astrometric analysis of nearby low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with instrumentation work to upgrade the NIRSPEC instrument for the Keck II Telescope. I will present results from a program using Spitzer/IRAC data to measure precise locations and distances to 22 of the coldest and closest brown dwarfs. These distances allow us to constrain absolute physical properties, such as mass, radius, and age, of free-floating planetary-mass objects through comparison to atmospheric and evolutionary models. NIR spectroscopy combined with the Spitzer photometry reveals a detailed look into the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and gaseous extrasolar planets. Additionally, I will discuss the improvements we are making to the NIRSPEC instrument at Keck. NIRSPEC is a NIR echelle spectrograph, capable of R~2000 and R~25,000 observations in the 1-5 μm range. As part of the upgrade, I performed detector characterization, optical design of a new slit-viewing camera, mechanical testing, and electronics design. NIRSPEC’s increased efficiency will allow us to obtain moderate- and high-resolution NIR spectra of objects up to a magnitude fainter than the current NIRSPEC design. Finally, I will demonstrate the utility of a NIR laser frequency comb as a high-resolution calibrator. This new technology will revolutionize precision radial velocity measurements in the coming decade., , Our recent mapping of the wispy terrains of Saturn's moons Dione and Rhea has revealed unique linear features that are generally long (10s-100s km), narrow (1-10 km), brighter than the surrounding terrains, and their detection may be sensitive to lighting geometries. We refer to these features as `linear virgae.' Wherever linear virgae are observed, they appear to crosscut all other structures, suggesting that they are the youngest features on these satellites. Despite their young age and wide distribution, linear virgae on Rhea and Dione have largely been overlooked in the literature. Linear virgae on Dione have previously been identified in Voyager and Cassini Data, but their formation remains an open question. If linear virgae are found to be endogenic, it would suggest that the surfaces of Dione and Rhea have been active recently. Alternatively, if linear virgae are exogenic it would suggest that the surfaces have been modified by a possibly common mechanism. Further work would be necessary to determine both a source of material and the dynamical environment that could produce these features. Here we present detailed morphometric measurements to further constrain whether linear virgae on Rhea and Dione share common origins. We complete an in-depth assessment of the lighting geometries where these features are visible. If linear virgae in the Saturnian system show common morphologies and distributions, a new, recently active, possibly system-wide mechanism may be revealed, thereby improving our understanding of the recent dynamical environment around Saturn., In this paper, we follow up on prior NIR spectroscopy by our group and use a modified Allers &amp; Liu (A13, 2013ApJ...772...79A) method to determine surface gravities for 228 M, L, and T dwarfs. <P />We present medium-resolution (R~20000) J-band spectra of 85 M dwarfs, 92 L dwarfs, and 51 T dwarfs obtained as part of the Keck NIRSPEC Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey (BDSS). Ninety-seven spectra were published previously in McLean+ (2003ApJ...596..561M), Burgasser+ (2003ApJ...592.1186B), McGovern+ (2004ApJ...600.1020M), Rice+ (2010ApJS..186...63R), Kirkpatrick+ (2010, J/ApJS/190/100), Luhman (2012ARA&amp;A..50...65L), Thompson+ (2013PASP..125..809T), Mace+ (2013, J/ApJS/205/6), Mace+ (2013ApJ...777...36M), and Kirkpatrick+ (2014, J/ApJ/783/122), and the remaining 131 are presented here for the first time. <P />Observation information (spanning 1999 Apr to 2015 Mar) for all of the targets in our sample is listed in Table 1. <P />(4 data files)., Enceladus is the first outer solar system body on which pit chains have been positively identified. We map the global distribution of pit chains and show that pit chains are among the youngest tectonic features on Enceladus's surface, concentrated in the cratered plains centered on Enceladus's Saturnian and anti-Saturnian hemispheres. Pit chains on Enceladus are interpreted as the surface expressions of subsurface dilational fractures underlying a cover of unconsolidated material, which we infer to be a geologically young cover of loose regolith that mantles the surface of Enceladus. A widespread layer of regolith may act to insulate the surface, which has implications for the thermal state of Enceladus's ice shell. The widespread distribution of pit chains across the cratered plains indicates that this ancient surface has recently been tectonically active., Linear virgae near Saturn / How do they form? / Does Jupiter know?, We combine 131 new medium-resolution (R ∼ 2000) J-band spectra of M, L, and T dwarfs from the Keck NIRSPEC Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey (BDSS) with 97 previously published BDSS spectra to study surface-gravity-sensitive indices for 228 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs spanning spectral types M5-T9. Specifically, we use an established set of spectral indices to determine surface gravity classifications for all of the M6-L7 objects in our sample by measuring the equivalent widths (EW) of the K I lines at 1.1692, 1.1778, and 1.2529 μm, and the 1.2 μm FeH<SUB> J </SUB> absorption index. Our results are consistent with previous surface gravity measurements, showing a distinct double peak—at ∼L5 and T5—in K I EW as a function of spectral type. We analyze the K I EWs of 73 objects of known ages and find a linear trend between log(Age) and EW. From this relationship, we assign age ranges to the very low gravity, intermediate gravity, and field gravity designations for spectral types M6-L0. Interestingly, the ages probed by these designations remain broad, change with spectral type, and depend on the gravity-sensitive index used. Gravity designations are useful indicators of the possibility of youth, but current data sets cannot be used to provide a precise age estimate. <P />The data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation., We present parallaxes and proper motions for 21 late-type T and Y dwarfs in the Spitzer Parallax Program (PI: Kirkpatrick). The Spitzer Parallax Program targets all T6 and later dwarfs within the nearest 20pc to produce a volume-limited sample of the coldest brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. Measuring distances to the coldest brown dwarfs is an essential step towards completing the census of objects in the solar neighborhood and will aid in our understanding of the low-mass end of the field mass function. We used images from Spitzer’s IRAC channel 2 taken at maximum parallax factor over multiple epochs to determine astrometric fits to each object.

As a pure-parallel complement to the Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) survey, Scylla obtained 342 orbits of ultraviolet (UV) through near-IR imaging of the LMC and SMC with Wide Field Camera 3. In this paper, we describe the science objectives, observing strategy, data reduction procedure, and initial results from our photometric analysis of 96 observed fields. Although our observations were constrained by ULLYSES primary exposures, we imaged all fields in at least two filters (F475W and F814W) and 64% of fields in at least three and as many as seven WFC3 filters spanning the UV to IR. Overall, we reach average 50% completeness of m <SUB>F225W</SUB> = 26.0, m <SUB>F275W</SUB> = 26.2, m <SUB>F336W</SUB> = 26.9, m <SUB>F475W</SUB> = 27.8, m <SUB>F814W</SUB> = 25.5, m <SUB>F110W</SUB> = 24.7, and m <SUB>F160W</SUB> = 24.0 Vega mag in our photometric catalogs, which is faintward of the ancient main-sequence turnoff in all filters. The primary science goals of Scylla include characterizing the structure and properties of dust in the MCs, as well as their spatially resolved star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our images and photometric catalogs, which represent the widest-area coverage of MCs with HST photometry to date, are available as a high-level science product at the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes., The diffuse, atomic interstellar medium (ISM) dominates the mass reservoirs of galaxies and fuels the formation of stars. Measuring its basic properties (density, temperature, morphology) is crucial for understanding galaxies as evolving ecosystems. In this talk I will present an overview of current observational studies of the diffuse atomic ISM in the Milky Way. I will describe how we leverage multi-wavelength observations with advanced algorithms to unveil its structure, properties and kinematics in the local Solar neighborhood. Finally, I will summarize key open questions in the field., The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder survey. Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction toward these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ∼5 kpc along the line of sight., We present a study of photometric flares on 154 low-mass (≤0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) objects observed by the SPECULOOS-South Observatory from 2018 June 1 to 2020 March 23. In this sample, we identify 85 flaring objects, ranging in spectral type from M4 to L0. We detect 234 flares in this sample, with energies between 10<SUP>29.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>32.7</SUP> erg, using both automated and manual methods. With this work, we present the largest photometric sample of flares on late-M and ultra-cool dwarfs to date. By extending previous M dwarf flare studies into the ultra-cool regime, we find M5-M7 stars are more likely to flare than both earlier, and later, M dwarfs. By performing artificial flare injection-recovery tests, we demonstrate that we can detect a significant proportion of flares down to an amplitude of 1 per cent, and we are most sensitive to flares on the coolest stars. Our results reveal an absence of high-energy flares on the reddest dwarfs. To probe the relations between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators. These rotation periods span from 2.2 h to 65 d, and we find that the proportion of flaring stars increases for the most fastest rotators. Finally, we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars. As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely that planets around the most reddest dwarfs would enter the 'abiogenesis' zone or drive visible-light photosynthesis through flares alone., Although galaxies evolve by assembling the interstellar medium (ISM) into stars, standard gas tracers fail to account for the total ISM mass available for star formation. This is especially true at low metallicity and in strong radiation fields where dust shielding and dense molecular gas are scarce. Dust provides an independent tracer across phases, but its basic properties -- mass, grain size and extinction curve -- are poorly constrained between diverse environments. We propose to survey N66, the largest star-forming region in the low-metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with optical and ultraviolet imaging from Wide Field Camera 3. Along with archival imaging in the optical and IR from HST and JWST, we will constrain the intrinsic properties of resolved stars and the intervening dust independently from systematics of IR emission surveys and at 10x higher resolution. We will (1) quantify the influence of ionizing radiation fields on fundamental dust properties (2) map the ISM mass independently of emission systematics to quantify the nature of \`\`dark"" gas at low metallicity. HST is the only observatory with the superb resolution and UV sensitivity necessary for these objectives, and N66 is the perfect laboratory for quantifying the influence of star formation activity on the structure of the ISM in the SMC, an excellent prototype for galaxies in the distant Universe., The observing strategy for the 21cm Spectral Line Observations of Neutral Gas with the VLA (21-SPONGE) HI absorption is described in Murray+ 2015ApJ...804...89M <P />Our targets are bright (S<SUB>1.4GHz</SUB>&gt;3Jy), radio continuum sources from the NRAO/VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon+ 1998, VIII/65). <P />For all VLA observations (10C-196, 12A-256, 13A-205), we used three separate 500kHz bands with 1.95kHz channel spacing centered on the HI line (1.42040575GHz) and +/-1.5MHz, respectively. <P />(3 data files)., To trace HI emission throughout the local interstellar medium (ISM), we use the Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey (GALFA-HI) at the Arecibo Observatory. GALFA-HI is the highest angular resolution (~4'), highest spectral resolution (0.18km/s), large-area (13000deg<SUP>2</SUP>) Galactic 21cm emission survey to date. <P />As a sensitive probe of the absorption properties of HI in the local ISM, we assemble a sample of available 21cm optical depth spectra from the literature. From the 21cm Spectral Line Observations of Neutral Gas with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey (21-SPONGE) we select the 30 spectra in our region of interest. In addition to high-latitude spectra from 21-SPONGE, we include spectra from the Millennium Arecibo 21cm Absorption-Line Survey. These spectra have lower optical depth sensitivity than 21-SPONGE (σ<SUB>{tau}HI</SUB>=0.01 per 0.18km/s channels). We select the 28 spectra unique relative to the 21-SPONGE sample in our region of interest that do not show spurious spectral artifacts. <P />(1 data file)., Tracing the transition between the diffuse atomic interstellar medium and cold, dense gas is crucial for deciphering the star formation cycle in galaxies. Here we present Measuring Absorption by Cold Hydrogen (MACH), a new survey of cold neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption at 21 cm by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We target 42 bright background sources with 60 &lt; l &lt; 110°, 30 &lt; b &lt; 62°, significantly expanding the sample of publicly available, sensitive 21 cm absorption outside the Galactic plane. With matching 21 cm emission data from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI (EBHIS) Survey, we measure the total column density and cold HI fraction, and quantify the properties of individual HI structures along each sightline via autonomous Gaussian decomposition. Combining the MACH sample with results from recent HI absorption surveys, we produce a robust characterization of the cool atomic medium at high and intermediate Galactic latitudes. We find that MACH HI has significantly smaller column density relative to samples at similar latitudes, and the detected cold HI structures have smaller line widths, temperatures, and turbulent Mach numbers, suggesting that MACH probes a particularly quiescent region. Using all available observations, we compute the cumulative covering fraction (c) of cold HI at local velocities outside the disk: structures with τ &gt; 0.001 are ubiquitous (c ~ 100%), whereas high optical depths (τ &gt; 1) are extremely rare (c ~ 0%)., A precise accounting for interstellar dust is required to interpret the energy output of galaxies. However, our current understanding for how fundamental properties of dust grains vary between interstellar environments is severely limited. Furthermore, our best constraints for how galaxies beyond the Milky Way convert the dusty ISM into stars and planets are based on coarsely-calibrated star formation histories of local systems with unconstrained line-of-sight geometries. To tackle these glaring problems, we propose to conduct a pure-parallel, multi-band imaging program with Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to complement the upcoming Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultraviolet (UV) Legacy library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) survey. ULLYSES will observe massive stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) and other low-metallicity local galaxies. Our multi-band program, Scylla (named after the multi-headed, monstrous foe of Ulysses), will target random parallel fields of ULLYSES targets with WFC3 in photometric bands spanning the UV to the near infrared (NIR). We will: (1) map the extinction curve and dust grain properties at high resolution in a diverse range of interstellar conditions; (2) constrain the multi-dimensional structure of gas in the LMC and SMC; and (3) measure the comprehensive star formation and chemical enrichment histories of nearby dwarf galaxies. The result will be an unprecedented view of star formation in the dusty ISM., New observations of the SMC at 21cm were recently obtained by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) during Commissioning and Early Science observations in 2017 November. These data were combined with single-dish observations of the SMC from the Parkes Telescope as part of the HI4PI survey (2016, J/A+A/594/A116). For details concerning the observations and data reduction for the ASKAP+Parkes cube, we refer the reader to McClure-Griffiths+ (2018NatAs...2..901M). <P />(1 data file)., Resolving the phase structure of neutral hydrogen (H I) is crucial for understanding the life cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, accurate measurements of H I temperature and density are limited by the availability of background continuum sources for measuring H I absorption. Here we test the use of deep learning for extracting H I properties over large areas without optical depth information. We train a 1D convolutional neural network using synthetic observations of 3D numerical simulations of the ISM to predict the fraction ( ${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ ) of cold neutral medium (CNM) and the correction to the optically thin H I column density for optical depth ( ${{ \mathcal R }}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ ) from 21 cm emission alone. We restrict our analysis to high Galactic latitudes ( $| b| \gt 30^\circ $ ), where the complexity of spectral line profiles is minimized. We verify that the network accurately predicts ${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ and ${{ \mathcal R }}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ by comparing the results with direct constraints from 21 cm absorption. By applying the network to the GALFA-H I survey, we generate large-area maps of ${f}_{\mathrm{CNM}}$ and ${{ \mathcal R }}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ . Although the overall contribution to the total H I column of CNM-rich structures is small (∼5%), we find that these structures are ubiquitous. Our results are consistent with the picture that small-scale structures observed in 21 cm emission aligned with the magnetic field are dominated by CNM. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed correlation between H I column density and dust reddening ( $E(B-V)$ ) declines with increasing ${{ \mathcal R }}_{{\rm{H}}{\rm\small{I}}}$ , indicating that future efforts to quantify foreground Galactic $E(B-V)$ using H I, even at high latitudes, should increase fidelity by accounting for H I phase structure., SPECULOOS-South, an observatory composed of four independent 1-m robotic telescopes, located at ESO Paranal, Chile, started scientific operation in 2019 January. This Southern hemisphere facility operates as part of the Search for Habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars (SPECULOOS), an international network of 1-m-class telescopes surveying for transiting terrestrial planets around the nearest and brightest ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). To automatically and efficiently process the observations of SPECULOOS-South, and to deal with the specialized photometric requirements of UCD targets, we present our automatic pipeline. This pipeline includes an algorithm for automated differential photometry and an extensive correction technique for the effects of telluric water vapour, using ground measurements of the precipitable water vapour. Observing very red targets in the near-infrared can result in photometric systematics in the differential light curves, related to the temporally-varying, wavelength-dependent opacity of the Earth's atmosphere. These systematics are sufficient to affect the daily quality of the light curves, the longer time-scale variability study of our targets and even mimic transit-like signals. Here we present the implementation and impact of our water vapour correction method. Using the 179 nights and 98 targets observed in the I + z' filter by SPECULOOS-South since 2019 January, we show the impressive photometric performance of the facility (with a median precision of ∼1.5 mmag for 30-min binning of the raw, non-detrended light curves) and assess its detection potential. We compare simultaneous observations with SPECULOOS-South and TESS, to show that we readily achieve high-precision, space-level photometry for bright, UCDs, highlighting SPECULOOS-South as the first facility of its kind., A precise accounting for interstellar dust is required to interpret the energy output of galaxies. However, our current understanding for how fundamental properties of dust grains vary between interstellar environments is severely limited. Furthermore, our best constraints for how galaxies beyond the Milky Way convert the dusty ISM into stars and planets are based on coarsely-calibrated star formation histories of local systems with unconstrained line-of-sight geometries.

The result will be an unprecedented view of star formation in the dusty ISM., Although gas in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been violently disrupted by ongoing dynamical interactions with the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way, its integrated velocity field displays a gradient consistent with a rotating disk. To test the rotating disk hypothesis, we trace the 3D motions of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) distribution using young, massive stars embedded within it. These stars have radial velocity measurements from spectroscopic surveys and proper motions from Gaia, and their radial velocities match with dominant HI components. We compare the observed radial and tangential velocities of these stars with predictions from the state-of-the-art rotating disk model based on high-resolution 21 cm observations of the SMC from the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder telescope. We conclude that the kinematics of gas-tracing stars are inconsistent with disk rotation, and the kinematics of gas in the SMC are more complex than can be inferred from the integrated radial velocity field. As a result of violent tidal interactions with the LMC, non-rotational motions are prevalent throughout the SMC, and it is likely composed of distinct sub-structures overlapping along the line of sight., We investigate the kinematics of neutral gas in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and test the hypothesis that it is rotating in a disk. To trace the 3D motions of the neutral gas distribution, we identify a sample of young, massive stars embedded within it. These are stars with radial velocity measurements from spectroscopic surveys and proper motion measurements from Gaia, whose radial velocities match with dominant H I components. We compare the observed radial and tangential velocities of these stars with predictions from the state-of-the-art rotating disk model based on high-resolution 21 cm observations of the SMC from the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder telescope.

The result will be an unprecedented view of star formation in the dusty ISM., A precise observational accounting of multiphase gas and dust in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) is vital both for correcting observations of extragalactic light and for resolving the bottleneck between mass reservoirs and star formation in galaxies. To differentiate between distinct thermal phases of neutral hydrogen (HI), we train a convolutional neural network using synthetic spectra from numerical simulations to predict the true HI column density and the fraction of cold, optically thick HI along the line of sight from 21cm brightness temperature spectra. We validate the model using 100s of HI absorption observations from the literature, finding excellent accuracy. With this model, we construct the highest-resolution all-sky map of optically thick HI in the local ISM using large-area 21cm emission data from the GALFA-HI and the HI4Pi surveys. This map will characterize the structure of neutral gas envelopes to molecular clouds, and to improve dusty Galactic foreground estimation for extragalactic surveys. Via comparison with tracers of dust reddening (E(B-V)), we demonstrate that E(B-V)/N(HI) increases with increasing cold gas fraction, which will be leveraged to produce the the highest-resolution, highest-fidelity E(B-V) map at high latitudes to date., We present 21 cm Spectral Line Observations of Neutral Gas with the VLA (21-SPONGE), a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) large project (∼600 hr) for measuring the physical properties of Galactic neutral hydrogen (H I). 21-SPONGE is distinguished among previous Galactic H I studies as a result of (1) its exceptional optical depth sensitivity (σ <SUB> τ </SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> per 0.42 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> channel over 57 lines of sight), (2) matching 21 cm emission spectra with the highest possible angular resolution (∼4‧) from the Arecibo Observatory, and (3) detailed comparisons with numerical simulations for assessing observational biases. We autonomously decompose 21 cm spectra and derive the physical properties (i.e., spin temperature, T <SUB> s </SUB>, and column density) of the cold neutral medium (CNM; T <SUB> s </SUB> &lt; 250 K), thermally unstable medium (UNM; 250 K &lt; T <SUB> s </SUB> &lt; 1000 K), and warm neutral medium (WNM; T <SUB> s </SUB> &gt; 1000 K) simultaneously. Of the total H I mass observed, 50% is detected in both absorption and emission. The CNM makes up the majority of the absorbing gas (56% ± 10%) and 28% of the total H I mass including gas detected only in emission. We find that 20% of the total H I mass is thermally unstable (41% ± 10% of H I detected in absorption), with no significant variation with Galactic latitude. Finally, although the WNM makes up 52% of the total H I mass, we detect little evidence for WNM absorption with 1000 K &lt; T <SUB> s </SUB> &lt; 4000 K. Following spectral modeling, we detect a stacked residual absorption feature corresponding to WNM with T <SUB> s </SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>4</SUP> K. We conclude that excitation in excess of collisions likely produces significantly higher WNM T <SUB> s </SUB> than predicted by steady-state models., The local interstellar medium (ISM) is suffused with “dark” gas, identified by excess infrared and gamma-ray emission, yet undetected by standard ISM tracers such as neutral hydrogen (H I) or carbon monoxide emission. Based on observed dust properties from Planck, recent studies have argued that H I mixed with dust is strongly saturated and that dark gas is dominated by optically thick H I. We test this hypothesis by reproducing this model using data from Planck and new 21 cm emission maps from GALFA-H I—the first large-area 21 cm emission survey with comparable angular resolution to Planck. We compare the results with those from a large sample of H I column densities based on direct observations of H I optical depth, and find that the inferred column density corrections are significantly lower than those inferred by the Planck-based model. Further, we rule out the hypothesis that the pencil-beam H I absorption sight lines preferentially miss opaque “blobs” with small covering fraction, as these structures require densities and pressures that are incompatible with ISM conditions. Our results support the picture that excess dust emission in the local ISM is not dominated by optically thick H I, but is rather a combination of intrinsic changes in dust grain emissivities and H<SUB>2</SUB> missed by CO observations., , Resolving the initial conditions for star formation and removing foregrounds from cosmological measurements both rely on precise accounting for the structure of multiphase, dusty interstellar gas in the Milky Way. Our aim is to differentiate between distinct thermal phases of Galactic HI and their dust-bearing properties. Using machine vision techniques, we autonomously decompose spectra from GALFA-HI at the Arecibo Observatory: the highest angular (4') and velocity resolution (0.18 km/s) large-area (13,000 deg^2) survey of 21 cm emission to date. We compute temperatures for millions of spectral features, and extract coherent structures corresponding to cold and warm HI. Via comparison with far infrared emission surveys, we analyze variations in dust reddening as a function of the cold gas fraction at high Galactic latitudes, and demonstrate how this effect can be used to improve the resolution and fidelity of standard dust reddening maps., We analyze synthetic neutral hydrogen (H I) absorption and emission spectral lines from a high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation to quantify how well observational methods recover the physical properties of interstellar gas. We present a new method for uniformly decomposing H I spectral lines and estimating the properties of associated gas using the Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD) algorithm. We find that H I spectral lines recover physical structures in the simulation with excellent completeness at high Galactic latitude, and this completeness declines with decreasing latitude due to strong velocity-blending of spectral lines. The temperature and column density inferred from our decomposition and radiative transfer method agree with the simulated values within a factor of &lt; 2 for the majority of gas structures. We next compare synthetic spectra with observations from the 21-SPONGE survey at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array using AGD. We find more components per line of sight in 21-SPONGE than in synthetic spectra, which reflects insufficient simulated gas scale heights and the limitations of local box simulations. In addition, we find a significant population of low-optical depth, broad absorption components in the synthetic data which are not seen in 21-SPONGE. This population is not obvious in integrated or per-channel diagnostics, and reflects the benefit of studying velocity-resolved components. The discrepant components correspond to the highest spin temperatures (1000&lt; {T}<SUB>s</SUB>&lt; 4000 {{K}}), which are not seen in 21-SPONGE despite sufficient observational sensitivity. We demonstrate that our analysis method is a powerful tool for diagnosing neutral interstellar medium conditions, and future work is needed to improve observational statistics and implementation of simulated physics., Neutral hydrogen (HI) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial to the life cycles of galaxies. The balance between disparate phases of HI -- including the cold neutral (CNM) and warm neutral (WNM) medium -- governs the formation of dense, star-forming material, and reflects the nature of feedback in galaxies. To probe the multi-phase structure of HI, we present results from 21-SPONGE: the largest and most sensitive survey for Galactic HI absorption ever at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Complemented by HI emission from the Arecibo Observatory, 21-SPONGE is uniquely sensitive to CNM and WNM temperatures from 10-10<SUP>4</SUP> K and column densities from 10<SUP>18</SUP>-10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Despite our unprecedented sensitivity, the maximum temperature we detect for individual spectral lines is Ts~1500 K, although stacking analysis of 21-SPONGE absorption lines indicates the presence of pervasive, high-Ts WNM population with Ts~7000 K. To understand the physics underlying these results, we developed Autonomous Gaussian Decomposition (AGD), a Python-based tool for efficiently and objectively analyzing spectral lines. By applying AGD to 21-SPONGE and 1000s of synthetic HI spectra from 3D numerical simulations, we correct our measurements for completeness and observational biases. We further prove that we can successfully recover the temperatures and densities of real clouds along simulated lines of sight. In addition, we show that absorption line shapes are sensitive to the strength and topology of the Lyman alpha radiation field and its role in HI excitation, which are poorly-constrained yet important for understanding the energy balance of the ISM. Our results are among the first to statistically quantify the success of observational methods at reproducing true HI properties, and represent crucial steps towards understanding the role of HI in star formation., The formation of stars and evolution of galaxies depends on the cycle of interstellar matter between supernova-expelled plasma and molecule-rich gas. At the center of this cycle is multiphase neutral hydrogen (HI), whose physical conditions provide key ingredients to theoretical models. However, constraints for HI properties require measurements of gas emission and absorption which have been severely limited by previous observational capabilities. In this thesis, I present the largest survey of Galactic HI absorption ever undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The survey, 21 cm Spectral Line Observations of Neutral Gas with the VLA (21-SPONGE), is a statistical study of HI in all phases using direct absorption measurements. Leveraging novel calibration techniques, I demonstrate the capability of the VLA to detect a significant sample of 21 cm absorption lines from warm, diffuse HI. To maximize observational sensitivity, I stack the 21-SPONGE spectra and detect a pervasive signature of the warm neutral medium in absorption. The inferred excitation (or spin) temperature is consistent with existing estimates, yet higher than predictions from theoretical models of collisional HI excitation. This suggests that radiative feedback via resonant scattering of Lyalpha photons, known as the Wouthuysen-Field effect, is influential with important implications for cosmological 21 cm observations. Next, I compare 21-SPONGE with synthetic HI spectra from 3D numerical simulations using a new, objective decomposition and radiative transfer tool. I quantify the recovery of HI structures and their properties by Gaussian-fitted 21 cm spectral lines for the first time. I find that 21 cm absorption line shapes are sensitive to simulated physics, and demonstrate that my analysis method is a powerful tool for diagnosing neutral ISM conditions. Finally, I compare properties inferred from synthetic spectra with ""true"" simulation results to construct a bias correction function for estimating HI properties. I apply this correction to the mass distribution of HI as a function of temperature from 21-SPONGE, and find a significant fraction of thermally unstable gas. This confirms that non-steady radiative and dynamical processes, such as turbulence and supernovae, have a strong influence on the thermodynamic state of the ISM., Images taken with the Cassini ISS instrument on 2013 April 15 showed the presence of a bright, extended object at the edge of Saturn's A ring. The gravitational signature of the object often appears as a discontinuity in the azimuthal profile of the ring edge and a subsequent analysis revealed that the object (nicknamed ""Peggy"") was detectable in ISS images as far back as 2012. The morphology of the signature is a function of the orbital phase suggesting that the object has a relative eccentricity or periapse with respect to the surrounding ring material. Tracking the signature allows a determination of the object's semi-major axis and following the initial detection this has varied by as much as 5 km. At no stage has the object been as bright as it was at the time of its discovery, suggesting","['2024arXiv241011695M', '10.3847/1538-4365/ad6de2', '2024ApJS..275....5M', '10.48550/arXiv.2410.11695', 'arXiv:2410.11695', '2024AAS...24412001M', 'arXiv:2312.07750', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad1591', '2023arXiv231207750M', '2024ApJ...962..120M', '10.48550/arXiv.2312.07750', '10.1093/mnras/stac1078', '2022MNRAS.513.2615M', '2022MNRAS.tmp.1043M', 'arXiv:2204.10417', '2022arXiv220410417M', '10.48550/arXiv.2204.10417', '2022hst..prop17118M', '10.26093/cds/vizier.22380014', '2022yCat..22380014M', '2021yCat..18990015M', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18990015', '2021ApJS..256...37M', '2021arXiv210615614M', '10.48550/arXiv.2106.15614', 'arXiv:2106.15614', '10.3847/1538-4365/ac0f0b', '2021hst..prop16786M', '2021yCat..18870267M', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18870267', '10.3847/1538-4357/aba19b', '2020arXiv200616490M', '2020ApJ...899...15M', 'arXiv:2006.16490', '10.48550/arXiv.2006.16490', '2020MNRAS.tmp.1399M', '10.1093/mnras/staa1283', '2020MNRAS.495.2446M', '2020arXiv200502423M', 'arXiv:2005.02423', '10.48550/arXiv.2005.02423', '2020hst..prop16235M', '2020AAS...23515501M', '2019arXiv191011283M', '2019ApJ...887..267M', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.11283', 'arXiv:1910.11283', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab510f', '2019hst..prop15891M', '2019AAS...23325209M', '2018arXiv180606065M', '2018ApJS..238...14M', '10.48550/arXiv.1806.06065', 'arXiv:1806.06065', '10.3847/1538-4365/aad81a', '10.3847/1538-4357/aaccfe', 'arXiv:1806.01300', '10.48550/arXiv.1806.01300', '2018arXiv180601300M', '2018ApJ...862..131M', '2018prs..book..338M', '10.1017/9781316286791.013', '2018AAS...23124729M', 'arXiv:1612.02017', '2016arXiv161202017M', '2017ApJ...837...55M', '10.48550/arXiv.1612.02017', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa5d12', '2017AAS...22920402M', '2017PhDT.......195M', '2016AGUFM.P33E..03M', '10.48550/arXiv.1506.03333', '2015arXiv150603333M', 'arXiv:1506.03333', '2015ApJ...808...41M', '10.1088/0004-637X/808/1/41', 'arXiv:1503.01108', '10.1088/0004-637X/804/2/89', '2015arXiv150301108M', '10.48550/arXiv.1503.01108', '2015ApJ...804...89M', '2015AAS...22514109M', '2014atnf.prop.6221M', 'arXiv:1401.1215', '10.48550/arXiv.1401.1215', '2014ApJ...781L..41M', '2014arXiv1401.1215M', '10.1088/2041-8205/781/2/L41', '2013AGUFM.P21E..04M', '2012EGUGA..14.9104M', '2011AAS...21724607M', '2011BAAS...4324607M', '2010arXiv1009.1738M', 'arXiv:1009.1738', '10.48550/arXiv.1009.1738', '2010exop.book...15M', '2010EGUGA..12.9971M', '2007AGUFM.P53E..03M', '10.1016/j.icarus.2005.06.009', '2005Icar..179..222M', '2005BAAS...37..767M', '2005DPS....37.6405M', '2004BAAS...36R1077M', '2004DPS....36.0703M', '2004BAAS...36R.863M', '2004DDA....35.0901M']","[('ring', 63), ('star', 57), ('gas', 45), ('observation', 43), ('structure', 43), ('line', 39), ('absorption', 39), ('object', 37), ('survey', 36), ('ism', 35)]","[(('star', 'formation'), 17), (('spectral', 'line'), 14), (('column', 'density'), 14), (('interstellar', 'medium'), 13), (('line', 'sight'), 13), (('optical', 'depth'), 11), (('neutral', 'hydrogen'), 11), (('medium', 'ism'), 10), (('magellanic', 'cloud'), 10), (('low', 'metallicity'), 10)]","[(('interstellar', 'medium', 'ism'), 10), (('karl', 'jansky', 'large'), 9), (('jansky', 'large', 'array'), 9), (('large', 'array', 'vla'), 7), (('cm', 'spectral', 'line'), 6), (('spectral', 'line', 'observations'), 6), (('line', 'observations', 'neutral'), 6), (('observations', 'neutral', 'gas'), 6), (('wide', 'field', 'camera'), 5), (('hubble', 'space', 'telescope'), 4)]",Dirty

Astronomers are starting to consider how our resource requirements may contribute to this crisis and how we may better conduct our research in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. Astronomers for Planet Earth is an international organisation (more than 1,700 members from over 70 countries as of November 2022) that seeks to answer the call for sustainability to be at the heart of astronomers' practices. In this article, we review the organisation's history, summarising the proactive, collaborative efforts and research into astronomy sustainability conducted by its members. We update the state of affairs with respect to the carbon footprint of astronomy research, noting an improvement in renewable energy powering supercomputing facilities in Australia, reducing that component of our footprint by a factor of 2–3. We discuss how, despite accelerated changes made throughout the pandemic, we still must address the format of our meetings. Using recent annual meetings of the Australian and European astronomical societies as examples, we demonstrate that the more online-focussed a meeting is, the greater its attendance and the lower its emissions., The light curves of black hole X-ray binaries show variability on timescales from milliseconds to months. The shorter (sub-second) variability is particularly interesting because it probes the inner region of the accretion disk around compact object. Many exciting black hole transients have gone into outburst in the past year, and from them we have seen the timing signatures of broadband (or band-limited) noise and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in soft and hard X-ray bands. In this talk, I will discuss and compare timing observations of new transients such as MAXI J1535-571, Swift J1658.2-42, MAXI J1727-203, MAXI J1631-471, Swift J1728.9-3613, and MAXI J1348-630, and recent outbursts of known transients like GX 339-4 and 4U 1630-47., The limitations placed upon human explorers on the surface of Mars will necessitate a methodology for scientific exploration that is different from standard approaches to terrestrial fieldwork and prior crewed exploration of the Moon. In particular, the data transmission limitations and communication latency between Earth and Mars create a unique situation for surface crew in contact with a terrestrial science team. The BASALT research program simulated a series of extravehicular activities (EVAs) in Mars analog terrains under various Mars-relevant bandwidth and latency conditions to investigate how best to approach this problem. Here we discuss tactical decision-making under these conditions, that is, how the crew on Mars interacts with a team of scientists and support personnel on Earth to collect samples of maximum scientific interest. We describe the strategies, protocols, and tools tested in BASALT EVAs and give recommendations on how best to conduct human exploration of Mars with support from Earth-based scientists. We find that even with scientists supporting them, the crew performing the exploration must be trained in the appropriate scientific disciplines in order to provide the terrestrial scientists with enough information to make decisions, but that with appropriate planning and structure, and tools such as a ""dynamic leaderboard,"" terrestrial scientists can add scientific value to an EVA, even under Mars communication latency., New ideas about how to analyze time-domain X-ray astronomy data have initiated the “spectral-timing revolution,” leading to a surge in developments of analysis techniques. Many individual tools and libraries exist, and some are even publicly available, but what has been lacking is a coherent set for a complete analysis. Stingray is a new community-developed, open-source software package in Python for spectral-timing analysis of astrophysical data. This software package provides the basis for developing spectral-timing analysis tools, while following the Astropy guidelines for modern open-source scientific programming. Our goal is to provide the community with a package that eases the learning curve for state-of-the-art spectral-timing techniques, with a correct statistical framework, to make maximal use of data from NuSTAR, NICER, and potentially STROBE-X and eXTP. In this talk, I will highlight the quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) modeling and the cospectrum tools in the Stingray library using new NICER and NuSTAR data, respectively. For more information on Stingray, see: http://stingraysoftware.github.io/, X-ray spectral-timing analysis seeks to investigate how matter behaves in the strong gravitational fields around compact objects. By simultaneously examining the spectral and temporal properties of the emission, we can deduce underlying causal relationships between the different emitting components. Spectral-timing analysis is founded in the understanding that photon arrival time and photon energy should not be analyzed separately, since they are intrinsically connected by the underlying physics. Techniques like energy-dependent time lags of X-ray variability and phase-resolved spectroscopy of rapid quasi-periodic oscillations have led to breakthroughs in our understanding of corona geometry, disk-jet interactions, and the possible origin of QPOs. In this talk, I will review the Fourier underpinnings of spectral-timing analysis and showcase examples of spectral-timing techniques with data from RXTE, XMM, NuSTAR, and NICER., The inner 100s of kilometers around compact objects in X-ray binaries are among the best laboratories for strong-field gravity. The X-rays originate from material in curved spacetime near the compact object, so they directly reveal the physical processes taking place in these extreme environments. NICER’s unprecedented combination of temporal and spectral resolution has enabled an in-depth look into the soft X-ray spectral-timing properties of accreting compact objects. By studying broadband time variability and time-dependent spectral variability, the NICER science working groups have uncovered new details about accretion physics and the geometry of matter flows in the strong-gravity regime. In this talk I will feature results from the NICER science team on quasi-periodic oscillations showing energy-dependent time lags, thermonuclear X-ray bursts impacting the accretion environment, an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar in an ultracompact binary, and the coronal evolution of a bright black hole. These results highlight the potential of NICER’s upcoming Guest Observer program to shed more light on exciting X-ray sources., Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are the most rapid (quasi-)coherent kind of variability that have been detected in the light curves of accreting neutron star X-ray binaries. Previous spectral-timing work using the rms spectrum revealed that the lower kHz QPO emission is a Comptonized blackbody, consistent with that expected from the boundary layer between the accretion flow and neutron star surface. To better interpret the spectral variability, we present phase-resolved spectroscopy of a kHz QPO for the first time, using a method based on the energy-dependent cross-correlation function. We find that the Comptonized spectral shape changes as a function of QPO phase, and the variations of the spectral parameters must intrinsically lag one another. These spectral variations could be explained by radial oscillations in the boundary layer caused by unstable accretion onto the neutron star, which could be due to plasma instabilities, asteroseismic modes, or an opacity-radiation trade-off like in the variable star mechanism. These possibilities can be explored in greater detail with current and future X-ray missions such as AstroSat, NICER, eXTP, and STROBE-X., We present the discovery of a low-frequency ≈5.7 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in observations of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571 in its soft-intermediate state, obtained in 2017 September-October by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. The feature is relatively broad (compared to other low-frequency QPOs; quality factor Q ≈ 2) and weak (1.9% rms in 3-10 keV), and is accompanied by a weak harmonic and low-amplitude broadband noise. These characteristics identify it as a weak Type A/B QPO, similar to ones previously identified in the soft-intermediate state of the transient black hole X-ray binary XTE J1550-564. The lag-energy spectrum of the QPO shows increasing soft lags toward lower energies, approaching 50 ms at 1 keV (with respect to a 3-10 keV continuum). This large phase shift has similar amplitude but opposite sign to that seen in Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer data for a Type B QPO from the transient black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4. Previous phase-resolved spectroscopy analysis of the Type B QPO in GX 339-4 pointed toward a precessing jet-like corona illuminating the accretion disk as the origin of the QPO signal. We suggest that this QPO in MAXI J1535-571 may have the same origin, with the different lag sign depending on the scale height of the emitting region and the observer inclination angle., We present the discovery and preliminary spectral-timing analysis of a low-frequency QPO feature in observations of MAXI J1535-571 in the soft-intermediate state, obtained by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). The feature is relatively broad and weak, with a weak harmonic and additional low-amplitude broadband noise. These characteristics likely make it a weak Type B QPO, like one previously identified in the soft-intermediate state of the transient black hole X-ray binary XTE J1550-564. The lag-energy spectrum of the QPO shows soft lags of about 50 ms with an inflected spectral shape, flattening above ∼4 keV. Preliminary QPO-phase-resolved spectral analysis suggests that the inflected lag-energy spectrum is due to the disk blackbody component lagging the Comptonized power-law emission by ∼27% of a QPO cycle. This large phase shift has similar amplitude but opposite sign to that seen in Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data for the Type B QPO from the transient black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4. We suggest that the Type B QPOs from these systems may have the same origin, in the form of a precessing jet-like corona illuminating the disk, with the different lag signs depending on the observer inclination angle., Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) are the most rapid (quasi-)coherent kind of variability that have been detected in the light curves of accreting neutron star X-ray binaries. Previous spectral-timing work using the rms spectrum revealed that the QPO emission is a Comptonized blackbody, consistent with that expected from the boundary layer between the accretion flow and neutron star surface. Furthermore, the lag-energy spectra and covariance spectra indicate that the lower kHz QPO arises from a more complex energy-dependent variability than just an overall modulation in the flux normalization. To better interpret the spectral variability, we present phase-resolved spectroscopy of a kHz QPO for the first time, using a method based on the energy-dependent cross-correlation function (CCF). The best-fitting spectral parameterisation requires the power-law index, high-energy cut-off temperature and seed blackbody temperature of the Comptonized emission to vary with QPO phase. Additionally, the variations in these three parameters show small but non-zero phase differences, which together can explain the previously observed lag-energy dependence. We suggest that these spectral variations could be explained by a ""breathing"" oscillation in the Comptonizing boundary layer; this possibility can be explored in greater detail with current and future X-ray missions such as AstroSat, NICER, eXTP, and STROBE-X., Compact objects like stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars are dense enough to significantly warp spacetime. By studying emission from very close to the compact object, we can decipher the effects of strong-gravity on physical processes, and test general relativity in the strong-field limit. There is a plethora of rapid sub-second variability in the X-ray light curves from compact objects in accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and a growing toolbox of analysis techniques and algorithms to apply to such phenomena. This thesis investigates quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and coherent X-ray burst oscillations. QPOs are a probe for studying physical processes in the inner regions of LMXBs, and X-ray burst oscillations are used to determine the masses and radii of neutron stars to constrain the neutron star equation of state. In Chapter 2, we present a novel spectral-timing technique to do phase-resolved spectroscopy of QPOs that tracks the variations of spectral parameters with QPO phase, and we apply it to a low-frequency QPO from the black hole GX 339-4. In Chapter 3, we use ray-tracing to simulate pulse profiles of thermonuclear burst oscillations from an accreting neutron star and fit these with an evolutionary optimization algorithm. In Chapter 4, we apply our phase-resolved spectroscopy technique to a lower kilohertz (kHz) QPO from the neutron star 4U 1608-52. Finally in Chapter 5, we carry out spectral-timing analysis of the low-frequency QPO seen by NICER in the new black hole transient MAXI J1535-571., We detail multi-year field investigations in Icelandic Mars analogue environments that have yielded results that can help inform strategies for sample selection and downselection for Mars Sample Return., We present experiments designed to simulate an inhabited martian lacustrine system analogous to Gale Crater. We describe the microbes found to thrive in this simulated environment and identify issues detecting biomarkers in this context., The light curves of low-mass X-ray binaries show variability on timescales from milliseconds to months. The rapid (sub-second) variability is particularly interesting because it is thought to probe the inner region of the accretion disk and the central compact object. Observations suggest that different types of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are associated with different emitting-region geometries (e.g., disk-like or jet-like) in the innermost part of the X-ray binary, that are varying possibly due to general relativistic precession. A new way to analyze QPOs is with spectral-timing, which seeks to investigate how matter behaves in the strong gravitational field around the compact object by causally linking the variations from different spectral components. We developed a technique for phase-resolved spectroscopy of QPOs, and are applying it to two types of low-frequency QPOs from the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4. Over a QPO “period”, we find that the energy spectrum changes not only in normalization, but also in spectral shape. We can quantify how the spectral shape changes as a function of QPO phase, and the two different QPOs show markedly different spectral changes. The ""Type B"" low-frequency QPO shows evidence of a large-scale-height (jet-like) power-law- emitting precessing region, while in the same outburst the ""Type C"" low-frequency QPO shows evidence of a small-scale-height (disk-like) power-law-emitting precessing region. These interpretations can be used to look into the evolution of matter in the strong-gravity regime., The equation of state of cold supra-nuclear-density matter, such as in neutron stars, is an open question in astrophysics. A promising method for constraining the neutron star equation of state is modeling pulse profiles of thermonuclear X-ray burst oscillations from hot spots on accreting neutron stars. The pulse profiles, constructed using spherical and oblate neutron star models, are comparable to what would be observed by a next-generation X-ray timing instrument like ASTROSAT, NICER, or a mission similar to LOFT. In this paper, we showcase the use of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to fit pulse profiles to determine the best-fit masses and radii. By fitting synthetic data, we assess how well the optimization algorithm can recover the input parameters. Multiple Poisson realizations of the synthetic pulse profiles, constructed with 1.6 million counts and no background, were fitted with the Ferret algorithm to analyze both statistical and degeneracy-related uncertainty and to explore how the goodness of fit depends on the input parameters. For the regions of parameter space sampled by our tests, the best-determined parameter is the projected velocity of the spot along the observer's line of sight, with an accuracy of &lt;=3% compared to the true value and with &lt;=5% statistical uncertainty. The next best determined are the mass and radius; for a neutron star with a spin frequency of 600Hz, the best-fit mass and radius are accurate to &lt;=5%, with respective uncertainties of &lt;=7% and &lt;=10%. The accuracy and precision depend on the observer inclination and spot colatitude, with values of ~1% achievable in mass and radius if both the inclination and colatitude are &gt;~60deg. <P />(2 data files)., X-ray spectral-timing seeks to investigate how matter behaves in strong gravitational fields. Observations suggest that different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are associated with different emission-region geometries (e.g. disk-like or jet-like) in the innermost part of an X-ray binary, close to the neutron star or black hole. We developed a technique for phase-resolved spectroscopy of QPOs, and have applied it to low-frequency QPOs from black hole X-ray binaries. On the QPO time-scale, we find that the energy spectrum changes not only in normalization, but also in spectral shape. We identify these changes as a phase-dependence of the intrinsic power-law emission as well as the response of the accretion disk to variable illumination by the power-law. We also look for systematic trends between different classes of sources and different accretion states. These trends help us to further constrain the origin of low-frequency QPOs and QPO evolution with the changing emission geometry in the strong-gravity regime., The equation of state of cold supra-nuclear-density matter, such as in neutron stars, is an open question in astrophysics. A promising method for constraining the neutron star equation of state is modeling pulse profiles of thermonuclear X-ray burst oscillations from hot spots on accreting neutron stars.

For the regions of parameter space sampled by our tests, the best-determined parameter is the projected velocity of the spot along the observer’s line of sight, with an accuracy of ≤3% compared to the true value and with ≤5% statistical uncertainty. The next best determined are the mass and radius; for a neutron star with a spin frequency of 600 Hz, the best-fit mass and radius are accurate to ≤5%, with respective uncertainties of ≤7% and ≤10%. The accuracy and precision depend on the observer inclination and spot colatitude, with values of ∼1% achievable in mass and radius if both the inclination and colatitude are ≳60°., We present a new spectral-timing technique for phase-resolved spectroscopy and apply it to the low-frequency Type B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) from the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4. We show that on the QPO time-scale the spectrum changes not only in normalization, but also in spectral shape. Using several different spectral models which parametrize the blackbody and power-law components seen in the time-averaged spectrum, we find that both components are required to vary, although the fractional rms amplitude of blackbody emission is small, ∼1.4 per cent compared to ∼25 per cent for the power-law emission. However, the blackbody variation leads the power-law variation by ∼0.3 in relative phase (∼110°), giving a significant break in the Fourier lag-energy spectrum that our phase-resolved spectral models are able to reproduce. Our results support a geometric interpretation for the QPO variations where the blackbody variation and its phase relation to the power-law are explained by quasi-periodic heating of the approaching and receding sides of the disc by a precessing Comptonizing region. The small amplitude of blackbody variations suggests that the Comptonizing region producing the QPO has a relatively large scaleheight, and may be linked to the base of the jet, as has previously been suggested to explain the binary orbit inclination-dependence of Type B QPO amplitudes., We describe fieldwork to Icelandic Mars analogues that investigated the spatial variation and correlation of three separate candidate biomarkers., We present a new spectral-timing technique for phase-resolved spectroscopy of low-frequency Type B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from the black hole X-ray binary GX 339--4. Evidence suggests that low-frequency QPOs originate from near-periodic geometric changes in the inner accretion flow, possibly due to general relativistic precession. The physical model predicts spectral energy distribution changes on the QPO timescale, but it is not possible to probe these changes using strictly spectral or timing analysis. Our new technique shows that for these data, the spectral energy distribution changes not only in normalization, but in spectral shape also, on the QPO timescale. We find that a blackbody spectral component and power law spectral component are both required to vary on the QPO timescale, and the blackbody variations are out of phase with the power law. With these findings we suggest a geometry for the precessing flow in the strong-gravity regime close to black holes., In much of the small X-ray timing community, the data analysis software is old, private, poorly maintained, and poorly documented, and we believe this will hinder the further development of the sub-field. With the advent of new timing missions like ASTROSAT and NICER, we want the community to have software that has a low entrance threshold and relatively small learning curve. We are in the early stages of developing Stingray, a general-purpose python package for timing and spectral-timing analysis of astronomical X-ray data, with the intent to expand to fast timing data in other wavelengths in the future. GitHub pull requests and issues are welcome! http://stingraysoftware.github.io/, I will present the application of a new spectral-timing technique for phase-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from black hole X-ray binaries. These signals are thought to originate from near-periodic geometric changes in the inner accretion flow, possibly due to general relativistic Lense-Thirring precession. Our technique lets us study how the different spectral components change with QPO phase, providing a crucial test of the model and providing new insight into the geometry of the emitting region and accretion flow in the strong-field gravity regime close to black holes., The accretion disks in neutron star and stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries provide an opportunity to study matter in strong gravitational fields. In particular, using spectral-timing measurements of X-ray emission, we can analyze the inner parts of the accretion disk and corona. Here we present the application of a new spectral-timing technique to carry out phase-resolved spectroscopy of rapid periodic and quasi-periodic signals from X-ray binaries. This technique measures relative phase and does not require ephemerides or exactly periodic signals, so it is applicable to a wide range of data, from X-ray millisecond pulsations to kHz and low-frequency QPOs. The method gives new insight into the physical mechanisms underlying these signals as well as the geometry of the emitting regions., The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) will have the ability to detect and characterise a broad suite of trace gases in the atmosphere of Mars. Interpreting the results of this mission will require an understanding of how these trace gases are transported from their sources, which may be deep underground, to the atmosphere, as this transport will change signatures that might identify the source of the gas. Here we present results of modeling designed to measure effect of transport on the release of gas from putative subsurface methane sources., The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) will have the capability of detecting and characterizing a broad suite of trace gases in the atmosphere of Mars. Interpreting the results of this mission will require an understanding of how these trace gases are transported from their sources, which may be deep underground, to the atmosphere. Here we present results of modeling designed to measure the timescales of release from putative subsurface methane sources. These transport timescales are far longer than mixing times in the atmosphere and could be up to 10 million years., The equation of state for cold ultra-dense matter has puzzled astrophysicists for decades. This is because the conditions of supra-nuclear density matter, such as those in neutron stars, are not terrestrially replicable. X-ray light curves from accreting neutron stars have proven to be useful tools in studying the neutron star equation of state. Theory predicts that the light curve from a thermonuclear X-ray burst on a rapidly-rotating neutron star can be used to determine the characteristics of the burst ignition spot and constrain the mass and radius of the neutron star. We discuss the development of spherical and oblate neutron star models that yield an X-ray light curve comparable to that which would be observed. Using this simulation code with a genetic algorithm, we disentangle the effects of various parameters on the light curve, showing which parameter degeneracies will have the greatest impact on the observables.","['2023arXiv230305259S', 'arXiv:2303.05259', '10.48550/arXiv.2303.05259', '2023CAPJ...32...15S', '2019HEAD...1730402S', '2019AsBio..19..369S', '10.1089/ast.2018.1837', '2019HEAD...1711502S', '2019HEAD...1720501S', '2019AAS...23342605S', '2019AAS...23323402S', '2018arXiv180907556S', 'arXiv:1809.07556', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.07556', '2018ApJ...865L..15S', '10.3847/2041-8213/aae1a4', '2018cosp...42E3259S', '2018cosp...42E3258S', '10.5281/zenodo.3241544', '2019PhDT........15S', '2018PhDT.......253S', '2018LPICo2071.6094S', '2018LPICo2071.6076S', '2017HEAD...1640002S', '2017yCat..18330244S', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18330244', '2017AAS...22920706S', '2016ApJ...833..244S', '10.48550/arXiv.1606.09232', 'arXiv:1606.09232', '2016arXiv160609232S', '10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/244', '10.48550/arXiv.1605.01753', 'arXiv:1605.01753', '2016MNRAS.460.2796S', '2016arXiv160501753S', '2016MNRAS.tmp..874S', '10.1093/mnras/stw1093', '2016LPICo1912.2010S', '2016HEAD...1510501S', '2016pyas.confE...6S', '10.5281/zenodo.48383', '2015ebha.confE..64S', '2014xru..confE.322S', '2014EPSC....9..317S', '2013EPSC....8..185S', '2013MsT.........17S']","[('ray', 50), ('spectral', 50), ('qpo', 40), ('timing', 33), ('star', 31), ('neutron', 30), ('phase', 27), ('binary', 22), ('qpos', 22), ('low', 21)]","[(('neutron', 'star'), 30), (('spectral', 'timing'), 23), (('black', 'hole'), 20), (('ray', 'binary'), 20), (('low', 'frequency'), 16), (('quasi', 'periodic'), 15), (('phase', 'resolved'), 14), (('periodic', 'oscillation'), 13), (('hole', 'ray'), 12), (('power', 'law'), 12)]","[(('black', 'hole', 'ray'), 12), (('phase', 'resolved', 'spectroscopy'), 11), (('quasi', 'periodic', 'oscillations'), 10), (('spectral', 'timing', 'analysis'), 9), (('hole', 'ray', 'binary'), 8), (('periodic', 'oscillations', 'qpos'), 6), (('low', 'frequency', 'qpos'), 6), (('technique', 'phase', 'resolved'), 6), (('ray', 'binary', 'gx'), 5), (('low', 'frequency', 'qpo'), 5)]",Dirty

Such detections will give insight into the CCSN mechanism and the structure of the progenitor star, and may resolve longstanding questions in fundamental physics. In order to properly interpret these detections, a thorough understanding of the landscape of possible CCSN events, and their multimessenger signals, is needed. We present detailed predictions of neutrino and GW signals from 1D simulations of stellar core collapse, spanning the landscape of core-collapse progenitors from 9 to 120 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In order to achieve explosions in 1D, we use the Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality model, which includes the effects of turbulence and convection in 1D supernova simulations to mimic the 3D explosion mechanism. We study the GW emission from the 1D simulations using an astroseismology analysis of the protoneutron star. We find that the neutrino and GW signals are strongly correlated with the structure of the progenitor star and remnant compact object. Using these correlations, future detections of the first few seconds of neutrino and GW emission from a galactic CCSN may be able to provide constraints on stellar evolution independent of preexplosion imaging and the mass of the compact object remnant prior to fallback accretion., The detection of neutrinos from the next galactic core-collapse supernova is almost a certainty. Properly interpreting this signal, however, requires knowledge of its progenitor and equation of state dependence, as well as an understanding of neutrino flavor mixing in CCSNe. I will discuss recent work to study and interpret the progenitor dependence of the neutrino signal using hundreds of CCSN simulations from a wide range of progenitors. From the neutrino signal, we will be able to determine the protoneutron star mass, explosion energy, and other quantities, independent of electromagnetic imaging. I will also share recent work to begin modeling the effects of neutrino flavor mixing in the CCSN environment., With the advent of modern neutrino and gravitational wave detectors, the promise of multi-messenger detections of the next galactic core-collapse supernova has become a certainty. These detections will give insight the core-collapse supernova mechanism, the structure of the progenitor star, and may even resolve longstanding questions in fundamental physics. In order to properly interpret these detections, a thorough understanding of the landscape of possible core-collapse supernovae events, and their multi-messenger signals, is needed. We present detailed predictions of multi-messenger neutrino and gravitational wave signals from spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations, spanning the landscape of core-collapse progenitors from 9-120 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We have used the STIR model, which includes the effects of turbulence and convection in spherically symmetric supernova models to mimic the 3D explosion mechanism. The gravitational wave emission from the spherically symmetric simulations was studied using an eigenfrequency analysis of the proto-neutron star. We have found that the neutrino and gravitational wave signals are strongly correlated with the structure of the progenitor star and remnant compact object. Future detections from a galactic CCSN will be able to provide constraints in the first few seconds of neutrino and gravitational wave emission on explodability prior to shock breakout, stellar evolution independent of pre-explosion imaging, and the evolution of the protoneutron star prior to fallback accretion., We have developed a new method for artificially driving core-collapse supernova explosions in 1D simulations. Turbulence is important for understanding the CCSN explosion mechanism, since turbulence may add a &gt;20% correction to the total pressure behind the shock and thus aid in the explosion. Including turbulence results in successful explosions in spherical symmetry without altering the neutrino luminosities or interactions, as is commonly done to produce explosions in spherical symmetry. This better replicates the physical explosion mechanism and more reliably produces the thermodynamics and composition, which is vital for accurately predicting the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the supernova environment. We have applied this model to explore the multi-messenger observable signals - light curves, neutrino emission, and GW emission - for the landscape of supernova progenitors from 9 - 120 M⊙. We have explored correlations between the underlying stellar structure and physics of the CCSNe mechanism with observable quantities., We summarize the impact of sterile neutrino dark matter on core-collapse supernova explosions. We explore various oscillations between electron neutrinos or mixed μ - τ neutrinos and right-handed sterile neutrinos that may occur within a core-collapse supernova. In particular, we consider sterile neutrino masses and mixing angles that are consistent with sterile neutrino dark matter candidates as indicated by recent X-ray flux measurements. We find that the interpretation of the observed 3.5 keV X-ray excess as due to a decaying 7 keV sterile neutrino that comprises 100% of the dark matter would have almost no observable effect on supernova explosions. However, in the more realistic case in which the decaying sterile neutrino comprises only a small fraction of the total dark matter density due to the presence of other sterile neutrino flavors, WIMPs, etc. a larger mixing angle is allowed. In this case a 7 keV sterile neutrino could have a significant impact on core-collapse supernovae. We also consider mixing between μ - τ neutrinos and sterile neutrinos. We find, however, that this mixing does not significantly alter the explosion and has no observable effect on the neutrino luminosities at early times., Abstract not available., The nature of dark matter and the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae remain two of the biggest questions in astrophysics. A heavy sterile neutrino species may provide a solution to both of these problems. Recent observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate that dark matter may be consistent with a ~ keV mass sterile neutrino. In core-collapse supernovae, sterile neutrinos can efficiently transport energy from the protoneutron star core to the stalled shock via oscillations between electron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos. We have performed simulations of core-collapse supernovae including a sterile neutrino with mass and mixing angle of a dark matter candidate. We have found that some choices of mass and mixing angle result in enhanced neutrino reheating and result in successful explosions, even in models that would not otherwise explode., We have made core-collapse supernova simulations that allow oscillations between electron neutrinos (or their antiparticles) with right-handed sterile neutrinos. We have considered a range of mixing angles and sterile neutrino masses including those consistent with sterile neutrinos as a dark matter candidate. We examine whether such oscillations can impact the core bounce and shock reheating in supernovae. We identify the optimum ranges of mixing angles and masses that can dramatically enhance the supernova explosion by efficiently transporting electron antineutrinos from the core to behind the shock, where they provide additional heating leading to much larger explosion kinetic energies. We show that this effect can cause stars to explode that otherwise would have collapsed. We find that an interesting periodicity in the neutrino luminosity develops due to a cycle of depletion of the neutrino density by conversion to sterile neutrinos that shuts off the conversion, followed by a replenished neutrino density as neutrinos transport through the core., Despite significant advancements in modeling core-collapse supernovae, there are still phenomena that we do not understand. The existence of a right-handed sterile neutrino may provide a means of solving some of the issues related to the lepton fraction, neutrino spectrum and energy transport within the collapsing core. Recent anomalous reactor results and cosmological constraints provide some bounds on the sterile neutrino mass m_{s} and mixing angle sin^{2} 2 theta. We have included the effects of a coherent active-sterile conversion for a ~keV mass sterile neutrino with sin^{2} 2 theta ~ 10^{-9}, including matter effects through the MSW mechanism, into a self-consistent supernova model. Preliminary results show that a few milliseconds prior to the core bounce there is a coherent conversion of electron neutrinos to sterile neutrinos, which alters the neutrino spectrum and dynamics of the collapse., Despite significant advancements in modeling core-collapse supernovae, there are still phenomena that we do not understand.

The E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC) is one implementation which combines optimal mapmaking using a spatial fast Fourier transform on gridded antenna voltage samples in the aperture plane to yield real-time radio images at extremely high time resolution, allowing for non-regular arrays, and scaling only as N log(N). I will report on optimizations of EPIC since our initial GPU implementation on the Long Wavelength Array Sevilleta station. New capabilities include commensal observing, wider bandwidth, responding to alerts, and continual monitoring of sources of interest. I will also show commissioning data demonstrating consistency with traditional processing methods when observing pulsars and solar radio bursts., The Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART) is an NSF funded project with goals of making radio astronomy accessible to a broad audience and increasing STEM participation among under-represented groups and non-traditional undergraduate. CHART itself is a platform for students and enthusiasts to build a low cost (\$100-200) telescope and learn about a range of topics from astronomy to electronics and data analysis. Undergraduate researchers drive the development of the platform using readily available consumer products ranging from software defined radios to aluminum foil and hot glue. They also write tutorials to help others in the community build their own telescope, troubleshoot, and analyze data. The students have built a working prototype which can detect radio emission from the Milky Way galaxy. They are now fine tuning the initial design, and exploring ways to expand to alternative astronomical targets and enhanced capabilities. The project has plugged into the Research Experience for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU) program at Arizona State University which focuses on supporting students who come from diverse backgrounds and face barriers to some of the traditional opportunities. In this talk I will describe the CHART project, offer lessons we have learned about running undergraduate research experiences, and how we are building a distributed community of amateur scientists., , The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is an open access telescope dedicated to studying the low-frequency (80-300 MHz) southern sky. Since beginning operations in mid-2013, the MWA has opened a new observational window in the southern hemisphere enabling many science areas. The driving science objectives of the original design were to observe 21 cm radiation from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR), explore the radio time domain, perform Galactic and extragalactic surveys, and monitor solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric phenomena. All together 60+ programs recorded 20 000 h producing 146 papers to date. In 2016, the telescope underwent a major upgrade resulting in alternating compact and extended configurations. Other upgrades, including digital back-ends and a rapid-response triggering system, have been developed since the original array was commissioned. In this paper, we review the major results from the prior operation of the MWA and then discuss the new science paths enabled by the improved capabilities. We group these science opportunities by the four original science themes but also include ideas for directions outside these categories., Direct imaging backends for large-N radio telescopes are a promising solution to the huge computational and storage requirements to enable the next generation cosmology and transient arrays. The E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC) is one implementation which combines optimal mapmaking using a spatial fast Fourier transform on gridded antenna voltage samples in the aperture plane to yield real-time radio images at extremely high time resolution, allowing for non-regular arrays, and scaling only as N log(N). I will briefly outline the concept behind EPIC and present the results from our first deployment of a GPU implementation of the algorithm on the Long Wavelength Array Sevilleta station, including the serendipitous detection of lightning and several meteors entering the atmosphere., Several low-frequency radio instruments are poised to detect faint signatures of the Epoch of Reionization through the redshifted HI 21 cm line, while near-infrared (NIR) observations continue to push studies of galactic properties to higher redshifts. With ongoing upgrades to radio facilities and the imminent launch of JWST, both fields are on the verge of revolutionary advances in the characterization of the EoR. But there remains an open question of how to marry these observations in a way that will fully exploit their complementary nature. NIR observations will reveal how galaxies formed and evolved, while 21 cm observations will trace the impact early galaxies had on their large scale environments. Simultaneous observation of these two physical processes is difficult owing to the disparate scales probed by the instruments. I will present a method for using images of large-scale 21 cm brightness temperature to constrain the reionization history of a given region of cosmological volume, thereby providing environmental context to galaxy observations in the same region. This framework is complicated by foreground contamination in 21 cm EoR images, but can be mitigated with filtering techniques and useful information is still recoverable. By adding local reionization history to NIR surveys, we will be able to distinguish between galaxies in a variety of environments. This has the potential to enhance expected signatures such as the flattening of the luminosity function at high redshift, or reveal new observables altogether., We present the E-field Parallel Imaging Calibration (EPICal) algorithm, which addresses the need for a fast calibration method for direct imaging radio astronomy correlators. Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform of antenna signals, alleviating an O(N<SUB>a</SUB> ^2) computational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more gentle O(N<SUB>g</SUB> log _2 N<SUB>g</SUB>) scaling, where N<SUB>a</SUB> is the number of antennas in the array and N<SUB>g</SUB> is the number of gridpoints in the imaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for next generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas. However, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without creating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather than on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form gain solutions quickly and without ever forming visibilities. This method scales as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from visibilities. We use simulations to demonstrate the EPICal technique and study the noise properties of our gain solutions, showing they are similar to visibility-based solutions in realistic situations. By applying EPICal to 2 s of Long Wavelength Array data, we achieve a 65 per cent dynamic range improvement compared to uncalibrated images, showing this algorithm is a promising solution for next generation instruments., The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has collected hundreds of hours of Epoch of Reionization (EoR) data and now faces the challenge of overcoming foreground and systematic contamination to reduce the data to a cosmological measurement. We introduce several novel analysis techniques, such as cable reflection calibration, hyper-resolution gridding kernels, diffuse foreground model subtraction, and quality control methods. Each change to the analysis pipeline is tested against a two-dimensional power spectrum figure of merit to demonstrate improvement. We incorporate the new techniques into a deep integration of 32 hours of MWA data. This data set is used to place a systematic-limited upper limit on the cosmological power spectrum of {{{Δ }}}<SUP>2</SUP>≤slant 2.7× {10}<SUP>4</SUP> mK<SUP>2</SUP> at k = 0.27 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> and z = 7.1, consistent with other published limits, and a modest improvement (factor of 1.4) over previous MWA results. From this deep analysis, we have identified a list of improvements to be made to our EoR data analysis strategies. These improvements will be implemented in the future and detailed in upcoming publications., Infrared and radio observations of the Epoch of Reionization promise to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmic dawn, and major efforts with the JWST, MWA, and HERA are underway. While measurements of the ionizing sources with infrared telescopes and the effect of these sources on the intergalactic medium with radio telescopes should be complementary, to date the wildly disparate angular resolutions and survey speeds have made connecting proposed observations difficult. In this paper we develop a method to bridge the gap between radio and infrared studies. While the radio images may not have the sensitivity and resolution to identify individual bubbles with high fidelity, by leveraging knowledge of the measured power spectrum we are able to separate regions that are likely ionized from largely neutral, providing context for the JWST observations of galaxy counts and properties in each. By providing the ionization context for infrared galaxy observations, this method can significantly enhance the science returns of JWST and other infrared observations., The Cosmic Dark Ages and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) remain largely unexplored chapters in the history and evolution of the Universe. These periods hold the potential to inform our picture of the cosmos similar to what the Cosmic Microwave Background has done over the past several decades. A promising method to probe the neutral hydrogen gas between early galaxies is known as 21cm tomography, which utilizes the ubiquitous hyper-fine transition of HI to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is an instrument built with a primary science driver to detect and characterize the EoR through 21cm tomography. In this thesis we explore the challenges faced by the MWA from the layout of antennas, to a custom analysis pipeline, to bridging the gap with probes at other wavelengths. We discuss many lessons learned in the course of reducing MWA data with an extremely precise measurement in mind, and conclude with the first deep integration from array. We present a 2-sigma upper limit on the EoR power spectrum of Delta2(k) &lt; 1.25 x 104 mK2 at cosmic scale k = 0.236 h Mpc-1 and redshift z = 6.8. Our result is a marginal improvement over previous MWA results and consistent with the best published limits from other instruments. This result is the deepest imaging power spectrum to date, and is a major step forward for this type of analysis. While our limit is dominated by systematics, we offer strategies for improvement for future analysis., The Murchison Widefield Array has collected over a thousand hours of data in an effort to characterize the stars and galaxies that drove the Epoch of Reionization. Teams from the US, Australia, and India are hard at work reducing the large volume of data to remove systematics, mitigate foregrounds, and reach a measurement of large scale hydrogen at redshifts 7 to 10. I will overview the US reference pipeline and present the first semester results., Using the final 128 antenna locations of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), we calculate its sensitivity to the epoch of reionization (EoR) power spectrum of redshifted 21 cm emission for a fiducial model and provide the tools to calculate the sensitivity for any model. Our calculation takes into account synthesis rotation, chromatic and asymmetrical baseline effects, and excludes modes that will be contaminated by foreground subtraction. For the fiducial model, the MWA will be capable of a 14σ detection of the EoR signal with one full season of observation on two fields (900 and 700 h)., Antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometers because it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (PSF, or array beam). This is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21-cm Epoch of Reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtraction depends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of the baseline distribution. Nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas can be placed - even at the remote Australian location of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas, emergency runways and trees. These exclusion areas can introduce spatial structure into the baseline distribution that enhances the PSF sidelobes and reduces the angular dynamic range. In this paper we present a new method of constrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in the baseline distribution. This method not only outperforms random placement algorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms random placement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are the smoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. We use our new algorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned MWA, and present the antenna locations, baseline distribution and snapshot PSF for this array choice.","['2023AAS...24120512B', '2021ASPC..531..412B', '2020PASA...37...14B', '10.1017/pasa.2020.4', '2019PASA...36...50B', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.02895', 'arXiv:1910.02895', '2019arXiv191002895B', '10.1017/pasa.2019.41', '2019AAS...23341304B', '2018AAS...23120306B', '2017MNRAS.470.4720B', '10.1093/mnras/stx1512', '10.48550/arXiv.1603.02126', '2016arXiv160302126B', 'arXiv:1603.02126', '2016arXiv160806281B', '10.3847/1538-4357/833/1/102', '2016ApJ...833..102B', '10.48550/arXiv.1608.06281', 'arXiv:1608.06281', '2014arXiv1410.5427B', '10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/128', '2015ApJ...800..128B', '10.48550/arXiv.1410.5427', 'arXiv:1410.5427', '2015PhDT........87B', '2015PhDT.......136B', '2015AAS...22530104B', 'arXiv:1204.3111', '2012arXiv1204.3111B', '10.1093/mnrasl/sls013', '2013MNRAS.429L...5B', '10.48550/arXiv.1204.3111', '2012arXiv1203.1293B', 'arXiv:1203.1293', '10.48550/arXiv.1203.1293', '2012MNRAS.425.1781B', '10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20878.x']","[('radio', 19), ('array', 19), ('mwa', 15), ('antenna', 14), ('data', 12), ('observation', 12), ('imaging', 11), ('method', 10), ('eor', 10), ('telescope', 9)]","[(('epoch', 'reionization'), 7), (('murchison', 'widefield'), 6), (('widefield', 'array'), 6), (('power', 'spectrum'), 6), (('array', 'mwa'), 5), (('baseline', 'distribution'), 5), (('direct', 'imaging'), 4), (('radio', 'telescope'), 4), (('promising', 'solution'), 3), (('field', 'parallel'), 3)]","[(('murchison', 'widefield', 'array'), 6), (('widefield', 'array', 'mwa'), 5), (('field', 'parallel', 'imaging'), 3), (('spatial', 'fast', 'fourier'), 3), (('fast', 'fourier', 'transform'), 3), (('long', 'wavelength', 'array'), 3), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'eor'), 3), (('direct', 'imaging', 'backends'), 2), (('imaging', 'backends', 'large'), 2), (('backends', 'large', 'radio'), 2)]",Dirty

We present the first robust observational constraints on rotation for FGK stars at ≈40 Myr. We have analyzed TESS light curves for 1410 members of five young open clusters with ages between 25 and 55 Myr: IC 2391, IC 2602, NGC 2451A, NGC 2547, and Collinder 135. In total, we measure 868 rotation periods, including 96 new, high-quality periods for stars around 1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. This is an increase of ten times the existing literature sample at the ZAMS. We then use the τ <SUP>2</SUP> method to compare our data to models for stellar angular momentum evolution. Although the ages derived from these rotation models do not match isochronal ages, we show that these observations can clearly discriminate between different models for stellar wind torques. Finally, τ <SUP>2</SUP> fits indicate that magnetic braking and/or internal angular momentum transport significantly impact rotational evolution even on the pre-main sequence., As stars approach the main sequence, they contract and spin more rapidly; once they reach the main sequence, they stop contracting and their spin speed decreases. This spin-down is widely considered to be caused by angular momentum lost via stellar winds. At and beyond the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), internal angular momentum transport between the core and outer envelope is thought to be crucial for understanding surface spin rates. Currently, however, we lack observational constraints on the rotation of Solar-type ZAMS stars to test the behavior of models at this critical age. We use TESS full-frame images to measure rotation periods (Prot) for stars in five young open clusters in the Southern Sky with ages between 30-60 Myr. We measure rotation periods for 891 cluster members with TESS, including 116 periods for stars with masses between 0.9-1.1 Solar masses; this represents a six-fold increase over ground-based period samples in the literature. We compare these Solar-type rotators to 5 models for stellar angular momentum evolution, and find that these models do not predict the full distribution of rotation periods at this age., As stars approach the main sequence, they contract and spin more rapidly; once they reach the main sequence, they stop contracting and their spin speed decreases. This spin-down is thought to be caused by angular momentum lost via stellar winds, but we lack observational constraints on the rotation of Solar-type zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) stars to test the behavior of models at this critical age. We use TESS full-frame images to measure rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$) for stars in five young open clusters in the Southern Sky. Out of 1503 stars with TESS data, we measure rotation periods for 1046; this is a four-fold increase over previous ground-based period samples. We compare the 187 Solar-type rotators to 5 models for stellar angular momentum evolution, and find that they fail to predict the fastest rotation periods at this age. We have also surveyed 35 FGK rotators in IC 2391 using speckle imaging at Gemini-South, and detect 4 candidate companions. We will present our results on the rotation of Solar-type stars at the ZAMS, as well as preliminary results on the impact of multiplicity on the ZAMS $P_{\rm rot}$ distribution., As Solar-type stars approach the main sequence, they contract and spin more rapidly; once they reach the main sequence, they stop contracting and their spin speed decreases. This spin-down is thought to be caused by angular momentum lost via stellar winds, but there are currently limited constraints on model behavior at this critical age. We use TESS full-frame images to measure rotation periods for stars in five young open clusters in the Southern Sky. We will present preliminary results on the rotation of Solar-type stars at the ZAMS., Binary companions likely affect stellar rotational evolution via tides (for close binaries) and disruption of the protoplanetary disk (for binary semimajor axes out to at least 5 to 80 AU). However, models of angular momentum evolution assume that all stars are single, and tidal models for solar-type stars cannot explain the handful of existing observations. Binary surveys in open clusters are woefully incomplete - we still lack observations for many cluster members with measured rotation periods. We present preliminary results from two complementary surveys that attempt to fill in gaps in our understanding of binary evolution. We have surveyed 51 M0-M1 rotators in the Praesepe open cluster using adaptive optics and non-redundant aperture masking at Keck II. We detect 19 companions and 5 probable chance alignments from our core sample, and combine these with other surveys to examine the impact of companions on the rotation distribution in Praesepe. We have also surveyed 35 FGK rotators in zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) clusters using speckle imaging at Gemini-South. We detect 5 candidate companions in these young clusters. Finally, we combine new and archival imaging data with Gaia DR2 to place constraints on any undetected companions. We present preliminary results showing that rapid rotators tend to have companions within 80 AU, in agreement with other recent surveys., We analyze K2 Campaign 13 (2017 Mar 08-2017 May 27) light curves for 132 members of the Hyades open cluster. <P />(3 data files)., Binary companions likely affect stellar rotational evolution via tides (for close binaries) and disruption of the protoplanetary disk (out to at least 5 to 80 AU). However, models of angular momentum evolution assume that all stars are single, and tidal models for solar-type stars cannot explain the handful of existing observations. Binary surveys in open clusters are woefully incomplete, particularly for K and M stars and stars with measured rotation periods. We have surveyed 51 M0-M1 members of the Praesepe open cluster using adaptive optics and non-redundant aperture masking at Keck II. All of our targets already have rotation period measurements. We detect 19 companions and 5 probable chance alignments from our core sample and combine these with other surveys to examine the impact of companions on the rotation distribution in Praesepe. We present preliminary results showing that rapid rotators tend to have companions within 80 AU, in agreement with other recent surveys., Angular momentum will be conserved in a forming star system, but can be distributed among several channels: stellar rotation, protostellar disks, and the orbit of any companion(s). Understanding stellar rotational evolution therefore requires that we understand how that evolution differs in single or multiple stars. Observations of open clusters with NASA's Kepler and K2 missions have revolutionized the study of stellar rotational evolution, and measurements from Kepler/K2 provide important benchmarks for theoretical models. Stars in young open clusters with masses 0.3-1.3 Msun show a range of rotation periods, from about 1-10 days. In older clusters, the higher-mass stars follow a single-valued mass-period sequence, while lower-mass stars maintain their spread in rotation rate. Magnetic winds are thought to carry away angular momentum and cause this convergence to slower rotation periods, but models still fail to match open cluster observations, particularly for early M dwarfs (0.35-0.6 Msun). Binary or multiple systems may have a significant impact on the initial rotation distribution in a cluster, but models currently assume all stars are single. Angular momentum transfer to a primordial disk is already invoked to explain the 1-10 day spread in periods in very young clusters: disks act as an angular momentum sink, allowing disked stars to contract without spinning faster, while stars which lose their disks earlier will spin up significantly. Studies have shown that disk disruption can be accelerated in binaries with separations roughly less than 40-80 AU. Although there is also evidence that diskless stars spin more rapidly in young clusters, no study so far has analyzed rotation and multiplicity in detail. We propose to compare the binary properties of fast and slow rotators among early M dwarfs in the benchmark Praesepe open cluster. Previous studies of rotation in binaries have focused on indirect detections of either rotation or multiplicity, and/or have used only one method to detect binaries. However, different binary detection methods (e.g., radial velocities or direct imaging) are each sensitive to a limited range of potential orbital parameters. We must therefore combine multiple methods for binary detection, in order to assess the relationship between binary separation and rotation period. We will supplement adaptive optics (AO) observations from the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) with archival radial velocity data and astrometry, in order to study rotation in binaries from 0.1 AU to over 1000 AU. There are 57 AO observations of Praesepe M dwarfs in the KOA, and all of these stars have corresponding rotation data from K2. We will carry out a detailed statistical analysis of these AO images, in conjunction with supplementary data, in order to robustly characterize the impact of multiplicity on rotation. This proposal supports NASA's strategic goals, along with enhancing science outcomes from NASA's K2 Mission. The primary goal of this project is to understand how binary companions influence stellar rotational evolution. The most likely explanation is that stellar companions disrupt the protostellar disk, allowing stars in binaries to spin faster than their single counterparts. Therefore our proposal supports the Cosmic Origins Program in its goal to understand how stars form and evolve. Finally, the proposed study will enhance the analysis of stellar rotation in Praesepe, which primarily uses data from NASA's K2 Mission., We analyze K2 light curves for 132 low-mass (1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ≳ M <SUB>*</SUB> ≳ 0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) members of the 600-800 Myr old Hyades cluster and measure rotation periods ({P}<SUB>rot</SUB>}) for 116 of these stars. These include 93 stars with no prior {P}<SUB>rot</SUB>} measurements; the total number of Hyads with a known {P}<SUB>rot</SUB>} is now 232. We then combine literature binary data with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry to select single-star sequences in the Hyades and its roughly coeval Praesepe open cluster and derive a new reddening value of A <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.035 ± 0.011 for Praesepe. Comparing the effective temperature-{P}<SUB>rot</SUB>} distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4 day slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This {P}<SUB>rot</SUB>} difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57 Myr. However, this {P}<SUB>rot</SUB>} difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages., NGC 6811 is a crucial benchmark cluster for studying the evolution of stellar rotation, multiplicity, and tidal effects. With an age of 1 Gyr, it fills a gap in studies of tidal evolution in binary stars. We have surveyed NGC 6811 and the surrounding region with the Hectochelle spectrograph on MMT from 2007-2018. In total we have &gt;8300 spectra of &gt;3400 stars, and we identify &gt;300 new binaries, many of which are likely cluster members. We constrain the orbits of these binaries using a rejection sampling methodology that robustly handles multimodal orbital parameter distributions. Where rejection sampling yields a unimodal posterior probability distribution over the orbital elements, we fit a final orbit using Markov Chain monte carlo. We present partially or fully constrained orbits for binaries in NGC 6811, as well as preliminary results on tidal circularization in the cluster., We continue to use the Praesepe membership catalog presented in PaperII (Douglas+, 2014, J/ApJ/795/161), which includes 1130 cluster members with membership probabilities P<SUB>mem</SUB>&gt;=50% as calculated by Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007, J/AJ/134/2340) and 39 previously identified members too bright to be included by those authors in their catalog for the cluster. We assign these bright stars P<SUB>mem</SUB>=100%. We also continue to use the photometry and stellar masses presented in Table 5 of Paper II. For most of our analysis, as in that work, we include only the 1099 stars with P<SUB>mem</SUB>&gt;=70%. <P />K2 targeted Praesepe in its Campaign 5. We analyze the resulting long-cadence data for 794 Praesepe members. We present P<SUB>rot</SUB> for 677 K2 targets. Of these, 471 are new measurements. <P />(3 data files)., We propose to search for companions to low-mass stars, with the goal of comparing the binary fraction of fast and slow rotators. In our previous work, we found that half of rapidly rotating early M dwarfs in the Praesepe cluster are candidate binaries, compared to only a quarter of slow rotators. We seek to confirm this result, which suggests that binary stars have different initial angular momentum content relative to their single counterparts. This is most likely due to interactions between a companion and the protoplanetary disk. Our program uses adaptive optics and nonredundant aperture-mask interferometry to simultaneously survey projected separations between 2 and 1250 AU around each M dwarf., We analyze K2 light curves for 794 low-mass (1 ≳ {M}<SUB>* </SUB> ≳ 0.1 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>) members of the ≈650 Myr old open cluster Praesepe and measure rotation periods (P <SUB>rot</SUB>) for 677 of these stars. We find that half of the rapidly rotating ≳ 0.3 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> stars are confirmed or candidate binary systems. The remaining ≳ 0.3 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> fast rotators have not been searched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We previously found that nearly all rapidly rotating ≳ 0.3 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> stars in the Hyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different P <SUB>rot</SUB> distributions. We also compare the observed P <SUB>rot</SUB> distribution in Praesepe to that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe the clear bimodal P <SUB>rot</SUB> distribution predicted by Brown for &gt;0.5 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> stars at the age of Praesepe, but 0.25-0.5 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> stars do show stronger bimodality. In addition, we find that &gt;60% of early M dwarfs in Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al., which suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to solar-type stars and fully convective stars. The incompleteness of surveys for binaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models since the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single stars., Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007, J/AJ/134/2340) calculated proper motions and photometry for several million objects within 7° of the center of Praesepe. The resulting catalog includes 1128 candidate cluster members with membership probabilities P<SUB>mem</SUB>&gt;50%. As in Paper I (Agueros et al. 2011ApJ...740..110A), we supplement this catalog with 41 known members that are too bright to be identified as members by Kraus &amp; Hillenbrand (2007, J/AJ/134/2340). For the Hyades, we adopt the Roser et al. (2011, J/A+A/531/A92) membership catalog. These authors identified candidate Hyades members via the convergent point method and confirmed membership using photometry. We used the MDM Observatory Modular Spectrograph (ModSpec) on the Hiltner 2.4 m telescope to obtain spectra of stars in Praesepe and the Hyades over the course of five multi-night runs between 2010 December 2 and 2012 November 14. <P />(2 data files)., The oldest open clusters within 250 pc of the Sun, the Hyades and Praesepe, are important benchmarks for calibrating stellar properties such as rotation and magnetic activity. As they have the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at ~600 Myr. The repurposed Kepler mission, K2, has allowed us to measure rotation periods for dozens of Hyads and hundreds of Praesepe members, including the first periods measured for fully convective Hyads. These data have enabled new tests of models describing the evolution of stellar rotation; discrepancies with these models imply that we still do not fully understand how magnetic fields affect stellar spin-down. I will present rotation periods measured for 48 Hyads and 699 Praesepe members with K2, along with associated Halpha and X-ray fluxes. I will also show how we can compare the dependence of H-alpha and X-ray emission on rotation in order to test theories of magnetic field topology and stellar dynamos. These tests inform models of stellar wind-driven angular momentum loss and the age-rotation-activity relation., , As the nearest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades is an important benchmark for calibrating stellar properties such as rotation and magnetic activity. Its proximity, however, means that cluster members are scattered across a wide area of the sky; previous studies of rotation relied on wide-area surveys designed to discover transiting exoplanets. I will present rotation periods measured using K2 data of the Hyades, including the first rotation periods of less than 1 day for cluster members and for fully convective Hyads. Discrepancies between Hyades data and gyrochronology models imply that we still do not fully understand how magnetic fields affect stellar spin-down. I will discuss how we can use the Hyades and the co-eval Praesepe cluster to test theories of stellar magnetic fields., As the closest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades is an important benchmark for many stellar properties, but its members are also scattered widely over the sky. Previous studies of stellar rotation in the Hyades relied on targeted observations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability surveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the first opportunity to measure rotation periods (P <SUB>rot</SUB>) for many Hyads simultaneously while also being sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members. We analyze K2 data for 65 Hyads and present P <SUB>rot</SUB> values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new measurements, including the first P <SUB>rot</SUB> measurements for fully convective Hyads. For 9 of the 11 stars with P <SUB>rot</SUB> in the literature and this work, the measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot evolution. Nearly all stars with masses ≲0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> are rapidly rotating, indicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection. When confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane, only three rapid rotators with masses ≳0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> remain. This is in contrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period sequence for ≈600 Myr old stars ends at ≈0.65 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when binaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict faster rotation than is actually observed at ≈600 Myr for stars ≲0.9 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than ≈0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than previously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for multiplicity., We designed a 2-day inquiry activity where students learned about error analysis and coding practices in Python. Inquiry-based lessons provide students with opportunities to independently investigate scientific concepts and tools. A general structure is developed ahead of time and minimal, careful guidance provided during the activity, but students are given as much freedom as possible to explore the concepts at their own pace. We designed our activity to help students learn to write flexible, re-usable, and readable code. I will describe the lesson structure we initially designed, as well as what aspects worked for our students (or didn't) and our experience leading the activity., Open clusters are single-age stellar populations that can be used to investigate the connection between angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity for stars of different masses over their lifetimes. The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Open Cluster Survey (POCS) is an effort to measure rotation periods (Prot) and tracers of magnetic activity for stars in clusters ranging from 80 Myr and 3 Gyr. We present the results of a comparative study of the rotation-activity relationship in two benchmark 600 Myr-old open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have similar ages and approximately solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at this age. We have compiled a sample of spectra -- more than half of which are new observations -- for 516 high-confidence members of Praesepe, along with new observations of 130 high-confidence Hyads. We have also collected Prot for 135 Praesepe members (including 40 Prot from POCS) and 87 Hyads. Unlike previous authors, we find no difference between the two clusters in their H-alpha equivalent width distributions, and therefore take the merged H-alpha and Prot data to be representative of 600-Myr-old stars. Our analysis shows that H-alpha activity in these stars is saturated for Rossby numbers Ro&lt;0.11. Above that value activity declines as a power-law with a slope of -0.73, which is much shallower than has been observed for activity-rotation relations in the literature. These data provide a useful anchor for calibrating the age-activity-rotation relation beyond 600 Myr., Open clusters are collections of stars with a single, well-determined age, and can be used to investigate the connections between angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime. We present the results of a comparative study of the relationship between stellar rotation and activity in two benchmark open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at ≈600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of 720 spectra—more than half of which are new observations—for 516 high-confidence members of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for 130 high-confidence Hyads. We have also collected rotation periods (P <SUB>rot</SUB>) for 135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare Hα emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, as a function of color, mass, and Rossby number R<SUB>o</SUB> , we first calculate an expanded set of χ values, with which we can obtain the Hα to bolometric luminosity ratio, L <SUB>Hα</SUB>/L <SUB>bol</SUB>, even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable distances. Our χ values cover a broader range of stellar masses and colors (roughly equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit better agreement between independent calculations, than existing values. Unlike previous authors, we find no difference between the two clusters in their Hα equivalent width or L <SUB>Hα</SUB>/L <SUB>bol</SUB> distributions, and therefore take the merged Hα and P <SUB>rot</SUB> data to be representative of 600 Myr old stars. Our analysis shows that Hα activity in these stars is saturated for {R_o}≤ 0.11<SUP>+0.02</SUP><SUB>-0.03</SUB>. Above that value activity declines as a power-law with slope β =-0.73<SUP>+0.16</SUP><SUB>-0.12</SUB>, before dropping off rapidly at R<SUB>o</SUB> ≈ 0.4. These data provide a useful anchor for calibrating the age-activity-rotation relation beyond 600 Myr., We will present the status of a common proper motion search for wide low-mass stellar and sub-stellar companions to known white dwarf-M dwarf binary systems. I-band observations were made using the 31"" NURO telescope at Lowell Observatory. Candidate companions are selected using astrometry from our own data and 2MASS photometry. We have begun to spectroscopically confirm candidates that pass our selection criteria. The ultimate goal of the search is to test star formation theories which predict that close binary systems form by transferring angular momentum to a third companion. To this end, we will model the physical companion population and perform Bayesian statistical analysis to determine the best-fit population model to our data. Here we will present our spectroscopically confirmed companions as well as the preliminary results of our population models and statistical analysis., We will present the results from common proper motion searches for wide low-mass stellar and sub-stellar companions to known tight binary systems. Observations were made with the 4m telescope at KPNO and the 31"" NURO telescope at Lowell Observatory. The binary systems observed at KPNO are spectroscopic binaries, while the systems targeted at NURO are unresolved or partially resolved white dwarf-M dwarf binaries. We are testing recent simulations of star formation that predict that tight binary systems form by transferring angular momentum to a lower mass third companion. Any genuine companions will be able to serve as 'benchmark' low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The central binary, particularly the white dwarfs, will allow us to estimate independent values of age and metallicity for the wide, low-mass companion. The candidates are primarily selected using astrometry, and then the list is refined with photometry. We present the candidate companions we have found to date and the future plans for this project., Recent results from the Phoenix Mars Lander revealed that, similar, to the dry permafrost/ice table region in high elevation Antarctic Dry Valleys (ADV), atmosphere just above the permanent ground ice on Mars is also saturated with water vapor and the soils above it bear a remarkable visual resemblance to the dry permafrost of the high ADV, without implying they are compositionally the same material. We hypothesized that if microorganisms are found in the ice table region of the ADV and this region is proven similar to the analogous site on Mars, we can argue for habitability of Mars soils. With this in mind, we undertook a study of ice table microbial ecology in soils collected from the ADV and spanning a range of climate regimes. These findings are from a preliminary microbiological investigation and combine microscopy, phylogenetic analysis, geochemistry, mineralogy and field observations. Our microbiological study is an addendum to an IPY project detailing soil characteristics and making in situ measurements with Earth analogue Phoenix Lander instruments. We found that both low elevation 'wet permafrost' and high elevation 'dry permafrost' ADV soils had low but significant numbers of bacteria present at the ice table surface but the types of organisms and their distribution in the soil profile reflected prevailing environmental conditions at each site. We will present our detailed analyses and we suggest, that, based on this preliminary study, the idea of using microbes as indicators of habitability, when tied to environmental parameters such as climate, soil chemistry, mineralogy, and structure as well as local geology, is a feasible way to test hypotheses of what constitutes a habitable environment on Mars.","['2023arXiv231117184D', '10.48550/arXiv.2311.17184', '10.3847/1538-4357/ad0fe3', 'arXiv:2311.17184', '2024ApJ...962...16D', '2023AAS...24116301D', '2022fysr.confE...5D', '2021tsc2.confE.157D', '10.5281/zenodo.5131306', '2021AAS...23714101D', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18790100', '2020yCat..18790100D', '2020AAS...23525608D', '2020adap.prop..192D', '10.48550/arXiv.1905.06736', '2019ApJ...879..100D', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab2468', '2019arXiv190506736D', 'arXiv:1905.06736', '2019AAS...23334816D', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18420083', '2018yCat..18420083D', '2017koa..prop..352D', '2017arXiv170404507D', 'arXiv:1704.04507', '2017ApJ...842...83D', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa6e52', '10.48550/arXiv.1704.04507', '10.26093/cds/vizier.17950161', '2017yCat..17950161D', '2017AAS...22913102D', '2017PhDT.......193D', '10.5281/zenodo.58988', '2016csss.confE.106D', '2016ApJ...822...47D', 'arXiv:1603.00419', '2016arXiv160300419D', '10.48550/arXiv.1603.00419', '10.3847/0004-637X/822/1/47', '2016pyas.confE..13D', '10.5281/zenodo.49737', '2015AAS...22513819D', '2014ApJ...795..161D', 'arXiv:1409.7603', '2014arXiv1409.7603D', '10.48550/arXiv.1409.7603', '10.1088/0004-637X/795/2/161', '2012AAS...21934518D', '2011BAAS...4324209D', '2011AAS...21724209D', '2008AGUFM.P51B1417D']","[('star', 73), ('rotation', 60), ('cluster', 51), ('binary', 42), ('stellar', 35), ('praesepe', 34), ('period', 32), ('age', 28), ('model', 28), ('companion', 27)]","[(('open', 'cluster'), 24), (('angular', 'momentum'), 23), (('rotation', 'period'), 23), (('main', 'sequence'), 11), (('measure', 'rotation'), 11), (('solar', 'type'), 11), (('momentum', 'evolution'), 10), (('rotational', 'evolution'), 8), (('cluster', 'member'), 7), (('preliminary', 'result'), 7)]","[(('measure', 'rotation', 'periods'), 11), (('angular', 'momentum', 'evolution'), 10), (('solar', 'type', 'stars'), 6), (('young', 'open', 'clusters'), 5), (('stellar', 'rotational', 'evolution'), 5), (('zero', 'age', 'main'), 4), (('age', 'main', 'sequence'), 4), (('main', 'sequence', 'zams'), 4), (('stellar', 'angular', 'momentum'), 4), (('rotation', 'solar', 'type'), 4)]",Dirty

It is the most expensive and complex astronomical observatory ever built and it was designed specifically to perform superlative new observations, such as the first systematic exploration of stars, galaxies, and black holes in the early universe, or detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. Luckily for us, this first systematic exploration is happening right now. I will provide an overview of this flagship telescope and discuss some of the early, and sometimes tentative, discoveries that have been made in Webb's first deep fields from the first light of galaxies and black holes, and finish by touching on some of the exciting scientific directions JWST is likely to probe in the near future., We use the panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting code Prospector to measure the galaxy logM*-logSFR relationship (the star-forming sequence) across 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 using the COSMOS-2015 and 3D-HST UV-IR photometric catalogs. We demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of the star-forming sequence, peaking for massive galaxies at ~0.5 and ~0.2 dex, respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize the density of the full galaxy population in the logM*-logSFR-redshift plane using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope at higher masses, with a normalization 0.2-0.5 dex lower than typical inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history constraints produce lower star formation rates (SFRs) than typical UV+IR formulae. We introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred from SED fitting and standard template-based approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of galaxy formation, resolving a long-standing ~ 0.2-0.5 dex offset with observations at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. The fully trained normalizing flow including a nonparametric description of $\rho (\mathrm{log}{M}^{* },\mathrm{logSFR},z)$ is available online <SUP>20</SUP> <SUP>20</SUP> https://github.com/jrleja/sfs_leja_trained_flow to facilitate straightforward comparisons with future work., NIRSpec MOS is a multiplexing workhorse that can provide high-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of distant galaxies in a single exposure. Its extreme sensitivity and novel wavelength coverage will provide a completely unprecedented window into the star formation histories and elemental abundances of galaxies in the early universe. However, there is a critical challenge: the micro-shutters are substantially smaller than many targets of interest, meaning that median galaxy at $1 &lt; z &lt; 3$ will have 65% of its light blocked by the shutter. More dangerous perhaps is that due to the intrinsic coupling between stellar populations and galaxy morphology, the light that is measured will unavoidably provide a biased view of a galaxy's stellar populations. Here we propose to solve this problem by developing a tool to build loose, flexible, spatially resolved models of the stellar populations in each galaxy. The model will knit together both resolved and unresolved imaging and aperture spectroscopy into a single unified framework by applying the spectrum as an integral constraint over the area of the MOS shutter. The model will be trained on realistic images and spectra from hydrodynamic simulations The extent to which the shutter spectrum can be generalized to the entire galaxy will be guided by the resolved photometric colors. We will rapidly develop and release this open-source tool to the community in combination with a live demonstration on relevant ERS data in order to maximize the scientific potential of the NIRSpec MOS. Investing early in analysis software developed by the community is an efficient way to ensure the \$10 billion JWST provides the best scientific returns., There has been a long-standing factor-of-two tension between the observed star formation rate density and the observed stellar mass buildup after z ∼ 2. Recently, we have proposed that sophisticated panchromatic SED models can resolve this tension, as these methods infer systematically higher masses and lower star formation rates than standard approaches. In a series of papers, we now extend this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3 inferred with the Prospector galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by Prospector. The stellar mass density is ∼50% higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at z ∼ 1. The next two papers in this series will present the new measurements of the star-forming main sequence and the cosmic star formation rate density, respectively., Galaxies are complicated physical systems which obey complex scaling relationships; as a result, properties measured from broadband photometry are often highly correlated, degenerate, or both. Therefore, the accuracy of basic properties like stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) depend on the accuracy of many second-order galaxy properties, including star formation histories (SFHs), stellar metallicities, dust properties, and many others. Here, we re-assess measurements of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using a 14-parameter physical model built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We find that galaxies are ∼0.2 dex more massive and have ∼0.2 dex lower star formation rates than classic measurements. These measurements lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density and increase the observed buildup of stellar mass, finally bringing these two metrics into agreement at the factor-of-two level at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5., There has been a long-standing factor-of-two tension between the observed star formation rate density and the observed stellar mass buildup after z∼2.

In a series of papers we now extend this analysis and present a complete, self-consistent census of galaxy formation over 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3 inferred with the Prospector galaxy SED-fitting code. In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of ~10^5 galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys.

The stellar mass density is ~50% higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at z~1. This talk describes a paper submitted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal., The UVJ color-color diagram is a popular and efficient method to distinguish between quiescent and star-forming galaxies through their rest-frame U-V versus V-J colors. Here we explore the information content of this color-color space using the Bayesian inference machine Prospector. We fit the same physical model to two data sets: (i) UVJ fluxes alone, and (ii) full UV-mid IR (MIR) broadband spectral energy distributions from the 3D-HST survey. Notably this model uses both nonparametric star formation histories and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to “break” the typical correlations observed in UVJ color-color space. Instead, these fits confirm observed trends between UVJ colors and observed galaxy properties, including specific star formation rate (sSFR), dust attenuation, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that UVJ colors do not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity; the observed trends in the UVJ diagram are instead driven by galaxy scaling relationships and thus will evolve with cosmological time. We also show that UVJ colors “saturate” below {log}({sSFR}/{yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP>)≲ -10.5, i.e., changing sSFR no longer produces substantial changes in UVJ colors. We show that far-UV and/or MIR fluxes continue to correlate with sSFR down to low sSFRs and can be used in color-color diagrams to efficiently target galaxies with much lower levels of ongoing star formation. We provide selection criteria in these new color-color spaces as a function of desired sample sSFR., Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models that capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we reassess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector- α built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. The resulting stellar masses are ∼0.1-0.3 dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are ∼0.1-1+ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from “old” (t &gt; 100 Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic SFR density by ∼0.2 dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by ∼0.1 dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector- α SFHs are both more physically realistic and much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data that can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new and more accurate physical parameters., Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the “gold standard” for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes a priori. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate as a function of time (SFR(t)) is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of ∼6000 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and measure scatters between priors to be 0.1 dex in mass, 0.8 dex in SFR<SUB>100 Myr</SUB>, and 0.2 dex in mass-weighted ages, with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t)., Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing &gt;10% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions for observed Hα and Hβ luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters., Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- α, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts Hα luminosities with a scatter of ∼0.18 dex and an offset of ∼0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the Hα luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features D<SUB>n</SUB>4000 and Hδ. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses., , We examine the connection between the observed star-forming sequence (SFR vprop M <SUP>α</SUP>) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. We find that the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope α &lt;~ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts because this would result in a much higher number density at 10 &lt; log (M/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) &lt; 11 by z = 1 than is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that α = 1 at log (M/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) &lt; 10.5 and α = 0.7-0.13z (Whitaker et al.) at log (M/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) &gt; 10.5, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then derive a star-forming sequence that reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. This star-forming sequence is also well described by a broken power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At z = 2, it is offset by ~0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and recent observations of the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent models of galaxy evolution, including semianalytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations from Whitaker et al., We present Keck/MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopy of the first mass-selected sample of galaxies at z ~ 2.3. Targets are selected from the 3D-Hubble Space Telescope Treasury survey. The six detected galaxies have a mean [N II]λ6584/Hα ratio of 0.27 ± 0.01, with a small standard deviation of 0.05. This mean value is similar to that of UV-selected galaxies of the same mass. The mean gas-phase oxygen abundance inferred from the [N II]/Hα ratios depends on the calibration method, and ranges from 12+log(O/H)<SUB>gas</SUB> = 8.57 for the Pettini &amp; Pagel calibration to 12+log(O/H)<SUB>gas</SUB> = 8.87 for the Maiolino et al. calibration. Measurements of the stellar oxygen abundance in nearby quiescent galaxies with the same number density indicate 12+log(O/H)<SUB>stars</SUB> = 8.95, similar to the gas-phase abundances of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies if the Maiolino et al. calibration is used. This suggests that these high-redshift star forming galaxies may be progenitors of today's massive early-type galaxies. The main uncertainties are the absolute calibration of the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the incompleteness of the z ~ 2.3 sample: the galaxies with detected Hα tend to be larger and have higher star formation rates than the galaxies without detected Hα, and we may still be missing the most dust-obscured progenitors., It is generally accepted that local elliptical galaxies assembled most of their mass in a burst of star formation between 1 &lt; z &lt; 3, yet today, their star formation has been almost entirely quenched. In order to constrain this quenching mechanism, we measure Hα line emission in galaxies sorted by multiple galaxy properties as a function of redshift to what galaxy parameter best predicts quiescence. This is done for samples of the most massive, most luminous, and galaxies with the highest velocity dispersion both locally (0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.07 in the SDSS) and at high redshift (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 in 3D-HST). It is demonstrated through spectral stacking that velocity dispersion results in the lowest Hα line equivalent width both locally and at high redshift. The spatial distribution of the emission line flux is available from grism spectroscopy: the line flux from the high dispersion stack is centrally peaked and thus likely associated with AGN activity rather than star formation, strengthening this conclusion. Since velocity dispersion may also be the best predictor of halo mass (Wake et al. 2012), this may imply that the quenching mechanism is directly related to halo mass., A central challenge in observational studies of galaxy formation is how to associate progenitor galaxies with their descendants at lower redshifts. One promising approach is to link galaxies at fixed number density rather than fixed luminosity or mass. This method is effective if stellar mass rank order is broadly conserved through cosmic time. In this paper, we use the Guo et al. semi-analytical model to analyze under what circumstances this assumption is valid in the context of a cosmological simulation. Specifically, we select progenitor galaxies at a constant number density and compare the stellar mass evolution of their descendants to the evolution at a constant number density. The median stellar mass of the descendants increases by a factor of four (0.6 dex) from z = 3 to z = 0. Constant number density selection reproduces this to within 40% (0.15 dex) over a wide range of number densities. We show that the discrepancy primarily results from scatter in the stellar mass growth rates and merging. After applying simple, observationally based corrections for these processes, the discrepancy is reduced to 12% (0.05 dex). We conclude that number density selection can be used to predict the median descendant mass of high-redshift progenitor galaxies. The main uncertainty in this study is that semi-analytical models do not reproduce the observed mass evolution of galaxies, which makes the quantitative aggregate effects of star formation, merging, and quenching on the rank order of galaxies somewhat uncertain., Further to CBET 1690, J.

FIRSST is primarily a facility for the community, with the majority of observing time dedicated to guest observer (GO) science. Equipped with both a multi-mode, direct detection far-IR spectrometer (~30-300 μm) and a long-wavelength heterodyne array receiver (~200-600 μm), FIRSST will fill a critical gap in the range of wavelengths currently accessible to observers. Here, we present an overview of the technical design, and highlight the three key science themes identified by the science team: (1) What is the origin and evolution of planet-forming disks? (2) What is the trail of water from molecular clouds to oceans? And, (3) How do galaxies assemble their material?, I will discuss the admissions process for graduate admissions in astronomy and astrophysics from the perspective of a graduate admissions committee member. This will include expectations of graduate programs for prior coursework and preparation, the evaluation process, and admissions statistics. Special focus will be given to best practices for holistic admissions and rubric evaluations., We present ALMA 1.3 mm observations of the HD 53143 debris disk-the first infrared or millimeter image produced of this ~1 Gyr old solar analog. Previous HST STIS coronagraphic imaging did not detect flux along the minor axis of the disk, which could suggest a face-on geometry with two clumps of dust. These ALMA observations reveal a disk with a strikingly different structure. In order to fit models to the millimeter visibilities and constrain the uncertainties on the disk parameters, we adopt a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. This is the most eccentric debris disk observed to date with a forced eccentricity of 0.21 ± 0.02, nearly twice that of the Fomalhaut debris disk, and also displays an apocenter glow. Although this eccentric model fits the outer debris disk well, significant interior residuals remain, which may suggest a possible edge-on inner disk, which remains unresolved in these observations. Combined with the observed structure difference between HST and ALMA, these results suggest a potential previous scattering event or dynamical instability in this system. We also note that the stellar flux changes considerably over the course of our observations, suggesting flaring at millimeter wavelengths. Using simultaneous TESS observations, we determine the stellar rotation period to be 9.6 ± 0.1 days., Debris disks provide a fossil record of the earlier planet formation process. In these systems, planetesimals (asteroids and comets) are eroded through collisions. The structure of these remnant belts is sculpted by planets, and can be imaged at high resolution to reveal a rich dynamical history. HD 53143 is a Sun-like G9V star at 18.3 pc with an estimated age of ~1 Gyr. Previous HST STIS coronagraphic imaging did not detect flux along the minor axis of the disk which was interpreted as resulting from a face-on geometry with two ""clumps"" of dust. We present the first image of this intriguing system at millimeter wavelengths taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 mm (Band 6). By fitting models directly to the millimeter visibilities, we are able to robustly constrain the structure of the disk. These new observations revealed that HD 53143 is instead eccentric, demonstrating a clear apocenter glow. We compare the millimeter and micron-sized dust distribution as traced by ALMA and HST, respectively, and consider potential misalignments that might inform our understanding of previous dynamics in this system., M dwarf stars are the most abundant stars in the galaxy and have a high frequency of Earth-sized planets, making them the favored targets of upcoming missions to detect and characterize exoplanets. However, these stars are known to exhibit high levels of activity and flaring, which can deplete a planet's atmosphere of water and ozone over time, raising questions about the habitability of planets around these stars. It is clear that there is still much to be learned about M dwarfs, their activity, and the potential habitability of their planetary systems. Monitoring campaigns with simultaneous observations across a broad range of wavelengths are needed in order to determine how stellar flaring emission correlates across the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, we propose to conduct such a campaign using HST STIS for four nearby M dwarfs, spectral analogues of Proxima Cen spanning a range of ages and activity levels. We have already been awarded observing time with ALMA, Swift, NICER, and ground-based optical facilities that will be executed simultaneously between now and October 2022. These HST DDT observations are the only way to add FUV coverage to this campaign. Recent observations of Proxima Cen suggest that UV and millimeter emission trace each other closely during flares, and this proposed study will show whether this is a universal property of mid-M dwarfs regardless of age. By deriving a scaling relation between millimeter and UV emission, we will have a powerful new tool to determine the UV environment of stars and their potential to host habitable planets, and be able to capitalize on existing all-sky cosmology surveys at millimeter and radio wavelengths., At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest exoplanetary system orbiting an M-type flare star, making it a benchmark case to explore the properties and potential effects of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. In April-July 2019, we observed Proxima Cen for roughly 40 hours with ground- and space-based facilities spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Simultaneous data is available from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Swift, and Chandra. I will present the initial results of this survey, which are already challenging our understanding of flare mechanisms and energetics. For many detected flares, millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely while optical emission is delayed, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a better proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets., More than 20% of nearby main sequence stars are surrounded by debris disks, where planetesimals, larger bodies similar to asteroids and comets in our own Solar System, are ground down through collisions. Debris disks represent the end-stage of circumstellar disk evolution, composed of remnant material that provides a fossil record of earlier planet formation processes. Planets orbiting within these disks sculpt the dust through gravitational interactions, producing observable structures that illuminate the dynamical evolution of the system. I will highlight recent results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which reveal a wealth of asymmetric structure in nearby debris disks. Modeling work is helping us understand the dynamical origin of these structures and potentially connect them to unseen planets., We present the discovery of an extreme flaring event from Proxima Cen by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the du Pont Telescope that occurred on 2019 May 1. In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of &gt;1000 and &gt;14,000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Surprisingly, optical emission associated with the event peaks at a much lower level with a time delay. The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for &lt;10 s. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar flares and often originates from short burst-like events., At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest exoplanetary system orbiting an M-type flare star, making it a benchmark case to explore the properties and potential effects of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. Here, we present the discovery of an extreme flaring event from Proxima Cen by the the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of &gt;1000 and &gt;14000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Optical emission is decoupled, peaking at a much lower level with a time delay. The extremely short duration of this event indicates that it could originate from a single flare loop or 'building block.' These are the first results from a larger campaign executed in April-July 2019 consisting of roughly 40 hours of simultaneous observations of Proxima Cen spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths., At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest exoplanetary system orbiting an M-type flare star, making it a benchmark case to explore the properties and potential effects of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. Here, we present the discovery of an extreme flaring event from Proxima Cen by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

These are the first results from a larger campaign executed in April-July 2019 consisting of roughly 40 hours of simultaneous observations of Proxima Cen spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths., At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest exoplanetary system orbiting an M-type flare star, making it a benchmark case to explore the properties and potential effects of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. Our previous discovery of a flare from Proxima Cen at millimeter wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has opened up an entirely new observational regime to study stellar flaring mechanisms. These are the first results from a larger campaign consisting of roughly 40 hours of simultaneous observations spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths. Here, we present the discovery of a second flaring event on 1 May 2019 from Proxima Cen with ALMA, but this time complemented by multi-wavelength observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) of optical photometry, and the DuPont telescope at Las Campanas of optical spectroscopy. In the millimeter and FUV, the May 1 flare is the brightest ever detected from Proxima Cen, brightening by a factor of &gt;1000 and &gt;14000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other very closely during the flare, exhibiting similar rise and decay times, peaking near simultaneously, and achieving large enhancements in luminosity. Optical emission is somewhat decoupled, peaking at a much lower level with a slight time delay. Given the unique characteristics of this event, it is possible that we are seeing an entirely new type of flare. The extremely short duration of this event suggests that it could originate from a single flare loop or 'building block' instead of an arcade structure consisting of multiple superimposed loops. The strong correlation between millimeter and FUV emission allows us to determine a tentative scaling relation. If this holds for a larger sample of events, millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high energy radiation environment of planets orbiting flare stars, required input for models of planetary atmosphere evolution., We present observations of the HD 15115 debris disk from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 mm that capture this intriguing system with the highest resolution (0.″6 or 29 au) at millimeter wavelengths to date. This new ALMA image shows evidence for two rings in the disk separated by a cleared gap. By fitting models directly to the observed visibilities within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework, we are able to characterize the millimeter continuum emission and place robust constraints on the disk structure and geometry. In the best-fit model of a power-law disk with a Gaussian gap, the disk inner and outer edges are at 43.9 ± 5.8 au (0.″89 ± 0.″12) and 92.2 ± 2.4 au (1.″88 ± 0.″49), respectively, with a gap located at 58.9 ± 4.5 au (1.″2 ± 0.″10) with a fractional depth of 0.88 ± 0.10 and a width of 13.8 ± 5.6 au (0.″28 ± 0.″11). Because we do not see any evidence at millimeter wavelengths for the dramatic east-west asymmetry seen in scattered light, we conclude that this feature most likely results from a mechanism that only affects small grains. Using dynamical modeling and our constraints on the gap properties, we are able to estimate a mass for the possible planet sculpting the gap to be 0.16 ± 0.06 M <SUB>Jup</SUB>., Debris disks are considered to be the end stage of circumstellar evolution, surrounding mature planetary systems that formed earlier. It is expected that any interior planets should interact with the dusty material in these disks, sculpting it through gravitational perturbations. HD 15115, an F-type star, hosts a nearly edge-on debris disk (originally dubbed the 'Blue Needle') that shows an extreme asymmetry in optical scattered light, with an extent almost two times larger to the west of the star than to the east. We present new observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 mm that capture this intriguing system with the highest resolution at millimeter wavelengths to date. For the first time, we see evidence in this new ALMA image for multiple rings or a gap in the HD 15115 debris disk. By fitting models directly to the observed visibilities within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, we are able to characterize the millimeter continuum emission and place robust constraints on the disk structure. We use this model fitting to infer the characteristics of a planet that could be producing the detected gap., The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is revolutionizing our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve. I will present ongoing work with ALMA that explores two related aspects of this field by (1) connecting debris disk structure to sculpting planets and (2) understanding the impact of stellar flares on planetary habitability. More than 20% of nearby main sequence stars are surrounded by debris disks, where planetesimals, larger bodies similar to asteroids and comets in our own Solar System, are ground down through collisions. The resulting dusty material is directly linked to any planets in the system, providing an important probe of the processes of planet formation and subsequent dynamical evolution. Detailed modeling of ALMA continuum observations can place constraints on possible planets responsible for sculpting nearby debris disk systems (including Fomalhaut and HD 15115). Through resolved imaging of debris disks, we also detect the host stars in many cases, yielding additional insights into the radiation environment of these planetary systems. Recently, ALMA detected a large millimeter flare from Proxima Centauri, opening a new window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the galaxy and have a high frequency of Earth-sized planets, making them the favored targets of upcoming missions to detect and characterize exoplanets. Through future multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns, ALMA has the potential to better constrain the properties of M dwarf flares and their impact on planetary habitability., We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm (230 GHz) observations of the HD 32297 and HD 61005 debris disks, two of the most iconic debris disks because of their dramatic swept-back wings seen in scattered light images. These observations achieve sensitivities of 14 and 13 μJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> for HD 32297 and HD 61005, respectively, and provide the highest resolution images of these two systems at millimeter wavelengths to date. By adopting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling approach, we determine that both disks are best described by a two-component model consisting of a broad (ΔR/R &gt; 0.4) planetesimal belt with a rising surface density gradient and a steeply falling outer halo aligned with the scattered light disk. The inner and outer edges of the planetesimal belt are located at 78.5 ± 8.1 au and 122 ± 3 au for HD 32297, and 41.9 ± 0.9 au and 67.0 ± 0.5 au for HD 61005. The halos extend to 440 ± 32 au and 188 ± 8 au, respectively. We also detect <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2-1 gas emission from HD 32297 co-located with the dust continuum. These new ALMA images provide observational evidence that larger, millimeter-sized grains may also populate the extended halos of these two disks previously thought to only be composed of small, micron-sized grains. We discuss the implications of these results for potential shaping and sculpting mechanisms of asymmetric debris disks., At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest extrasolar planetary system, and has long been known as a flare star, making it a benchmark case for exploring the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. After the detection of a large millimeter flare was reported by MacGregor et al. (2018), the team was awarded 36 more hours of observations (project 2018.1.00470.S) to monitor the Proxima Cen system in 2019 with ALMA. In order to determine how stellar flaring emission correlates across the electromagnetic spectrum, simultaneous observations with other facilities across a broad range of wavelengths should be obtained along with the ALMA project. With the UV being the most critical wavelength to understand planet photochemistry and habitability, we propose to obtain simultaneous UV spectroscopy with HST in order to better constrain the properties of detected flares and their potential impact on planetary habitability. By undertaking this comprehensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of Proxima Cen, we will execute the first truly panchromatic analysis of M dwarf flaring activity., M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the galaxy and have a high frequency of Earth-size planets, making them favored targets of missions to detect/characterize exoplanets. However, these stars exhibit high levels of activity, raising questions about the habitability of their planets. We recently detected a large flare from Proxima Cen with ALMA (MacGregor et al. 2018) that raises questions about the relationship between particle acceleration and plasma heating during flares. To explore this further, we are conducting a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of Proxima Cen involving ground- and space-based facilities. Measuring X-ray flaring energies is critical, since high energy radiation can erode a planet's atmosphere by photodissociating water and ozone. We propose to obtain simultaneous coverage with Chandra to constrain the X-ray properties of detected flares and their impact on planetary habitability, and to determine how flaring emission correlates across the EM spectrum., We present new analyses of ALMA 12 m and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) observations at 233 GHz (1.3 mm) of the Proxima Centauri system with sensitivities of 9.5 and 47 μJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively, taken from 2017 January 21 through April 25. These analyses reveal that the star underwent a significant flaring event during one of the ACA observations on 2017 March 24. The complete event lasted for approximately 1 minute and reached a peak flux density of 100 ± 4 mJy, nearly a factor of 1000 times brighter than the star’s quiescent emission. At the flare peak, the continuum emission is characterized by a steeply falling spectral index with frequency F <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ ν <SUP> α </SUP> with α = -1.77 ± 0.45, and a lower limit on the fractional linear polarization of | Q/I| =0.19+/- 0.02. Because the ACA observations do not show any quiescent excess emission, we conclude that there is no need to invoke the presence of a dust belt at 1-4 au. We also posit that the slight excess flux density of 101 ± 9 μJy observed in the 12 m observations, compared to the photospheric flux density of 74 ± 4 μJy extrapolated from infrared wavelengths, may be due to coronal heating from continual smaller flares, as is seen for AU Mic, another nearby well-studied M dwarf flare star. If this is true, then the need for warm dust at ∼0.4 au is also removed., More than 20% of nearby main sequence stars are surrounded by dusty disks continually replenished via the collisional erosion of planetesimals, larger bodies similar to asteroids and comets in our own Solar System. The material in these ‘debris disks’ is directly linked to the larger bodies such as planets in the system. As a result, the locations, morphologies, and physical properties of dust in these disks provide important probes of the processes of planet formation and subsequent dynamical evolution. Observations at millimeter wavelengths are especially critical to our understanding of these systems, since they are dominated by larger grains that do not travel far from their origin and therefore reliably trace the underlying planetesimal distribution. The Submillimeter Array (SMA) plays a key role in advancing our understanding of debris disks by providing sensitivity at the short baselines required to determine the structure of wide-field disks, such as the HR 8799 debris disk. Many of these wide-field disks are among the closest systems to us, and will serve as cornerstone templates for the interpretation of more distant, less accessible systems., HD 61005 (G-type star, “The Moth"") and HD 32297 (A-type star) host two of the most iconic debris disks. Scattered light images show that both disks are nearly edge-on with dramatic swept-back wings of dust. Previous studies have proposed a range of mechanisms to explain this distinctive morphology including interactions with the interstellar medium, secular perturbations of grains by low-density, neutral interstellar gas, and gravitational interactions with an inclined, eccentric companion. We present new observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 mm that provide the highest resolution images at millimeter wavelengths to date of both systems. Observations at millimeter wavelengths are especially critical to our understanding of the physical mechanisms shaping the structure of these disks, since the large grains that dominate emission at these wavelengths are less affected by stellar radiation and winds and more reliably trace the underlying planetesimal distribution. We fit models directly to the observed visibilities within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to characterize the continuum emission and place constraints on the structure of these unique debris disks. Our new ALMA images reveal that despite differences in spectral type, both systems are best described by a two-component structure with (1) a parent body belt, and (2) an outer halo aligned with the scattered light disk. Such halos have typically been assumed to be composed of small grains visible in scattered light, so these images are some of the first observational evidence that larger grains may also populate extended halos. In addition, we detect significant 12CO gas emission from HD 32297, and determine a robust upper limit for HD 61005., We present ALMA mosaic observations at 1.3 mm (223 GHz) of the Fomalhaut system with a sensitivity of 14 μJy/beam. These observations provide the first millimeter map of the continuum dust emission from the complete outer debris disk with uniform sensitivity, enabling the first conclusive detection of apocenter glow. We adopt an MCMC modeling approach that accounts for the eccentric orbital parameters of a collection of particles within the disk. The outer belt is radially confined with an inner edge of 136.3 ± 0.9 au and width of 13.5 ± 1.8 au. We determine a best-fit eccentricity of 0.12 ± 0.01. Assuming a size distribution power-law index of q = 3.46 ± 0.09, we constrain the dust absorptivity power-law index β to be 0.9 &lt; β &lt; 1.5. The geometry of the disk is robustly constrained with inclination 65.°6 ± 0.°3, position angle 337.°9 ± 0.°3, and argument of periastron 22.°5 ± 4.°3. Our observations do not confirm any of the azimuthal features found in previous imaging studies of the disk with Hubble Space Telescope, SCUBA, and ALMA. However, we cannot rule out structures ≤10 au in size or that only affect smaller grains. The central star is clearly detected with a flux density of 0.75 ± 0.02 mJy, significantly lower than predicted by current photospheric models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the directly imaged Fomalhaut b and the inner dust belt detected at infrared wavelengths., At least 20% of nearby main sequence stars are known to be surrounded by disks of dusty material resulting from the collisional erosion of planetesimals, similar to asteroids and comets in our own Solar System. The material in these 'debris disks' is directly linked to the larger bodies, like planets, in the system through collisions and gravitational perturbations. Observations at millimeter wavelengths are especially critical to our understanding of these systems, since the large grains that dominate emission at these long wavelengths reliably trace the underlying planetesimal distribution. In this thesis, I have used state-of-the-art observations at millimeter wavelengths to address three related questions concerning debris disks and planetary system evolution: 1) How are wide-separation, substellar companions formed? 2) What is the physical nature of the collisional process in debris disks? And, 3) Can the structure and morphology of debris disks provide probes of planet formation and subsequent dynamical evolution? Using ALMA observations of GQ Lup, a pre-main sequence system with a wide-separation, substellar companion, I have placed constraints on the mass of a circumplanetary disk around the companion, informing formation scenarios for this and other similar systems (Chapter 2). I obtained observations of a sample of fifteen debris disks with both the VLA and ATCA at centimeter wavelengths, and robustly determined the millimeter spectral index of each disk and thus the slope of the grain size distribution, providing the first observational test of collision models of debris disks (Chapter 3). By applying an MCMC modeling framework to resolved millimeter observations with ALMA and SMA, I have placed the first constraints on the position, width, surface density gradient, and any asymmetric structure of the AU Mic, HD 15115, Epsilon Eridani, Tau Ceti, and Fomalhaut debris disks (Chapters 4-8). These observations of individual systems hint at trends in disk structure and dynamics, which can be explored further with a comparative study of a sample of the eight brightest debris disks around Sun-like stars within 20 pc (Chapter 9). This body of work has yielded the first resolved images of notable debris disks at millimeter wavelengths, and complements other ground- and space-based observations by providing constraints on these systems with uniquely high angular resolution and wavelength coverage. Together these results provide a foundation to investigate the dynamical evolution of planetary systems through multi-wavelength observations of debris disks., At least 20% of nearby main sequence stars are known to be surrounded by disks of dusty material resulting from the collisional erosion of planetesimals, larger bodies similar to asteroids and comets in our own Solar System. Since the dust-producing planetesimals are expected to persist in stable regions like belts and resonances, the locations, morphologies, and physical properties of dust in these ‘debris disks’ provide probes of planet formation and subsequent dynamical evolution. Observations at millimeter wavelengths are especially critical to our understanding of these systems, since the large grains that dominate emission at these long wavelengths do not travel far from their origin and therefore reliably trace the underlying planetesimal distribution. The newly upgraded capabilities of millimeter interferometers like ALMA are providing us with the opportunity to image these disks with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. In this dissertation talk, I will present my ongoing work, which uses observations of the angularly resolved brightness distribution and the spectral dependence of the flux density to constrain both the structure and grain size distribution of a sample of nearby debris disks. I will present constraints on the position, width, surface density gradient, and any asymmetric structure of several debris disks (including Epsilon Eridani, Tau Ceti, and Fomalhaut) determined from ALMA and SMA observations. In addition, I will present the results of a survey using the VLA and ATCA to measure the long wavelength spectral index and thus the grain size distribution of fifteen debris disks. Together these results provide a foundation to investigate the dynamical evolution of planetary systems through multi-wavelength observations of debris disks., We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the GQ Lup system, a young Sun-like star with a substellar-mass companion in a wide-separation orbit. These observations of 870 μm continuum and CO J = 3-2 line emission with beam size ∼0.″3 (∼45 au) resolve the disk of dust and gas surrounding the primary star, GQ Lup A, and provide deep limits on any circumplanetary disk surrounding the companion, GQ Lup b. The circumprimary dust disk is compact with an FWHM of 59 ± 12 au, while the gas has a larger extent with a characteristic radius of 46.5 ± 1.8 au.

Thanks to self-calibrating observables, AMI accesses inner working angles down to and even within the classical diffraction limit. The scientific potential of this mode has recently been demonstrated by the Early Release Science (ERS) 1386 program with a deep search for close-in companions in the HIP 65426 exoplanetary system. As part of ERS 1386, we use the same data set to explore the random, static, and calibration errors of NIRISS AMI observables. We compare the observed noise properties and achievable contrast to theoretical predictions. We explore possible sources of calibration errors and show that differences in charge migration between the observations of HIP 65426 and point-spread function calibration stars can account for the achieved contrast curves. Lastly, we use self-calibration tests to demonstrate that with adequate calibration NIRISS F380M AMI can reach contrast levels of ∼9–10 mag at ≳λ/D. These tests lead us to observation planning recommendations and strongly motivate future studies aimed at producing sophisticated calibration strategies taking these systematic effects into account. This will unlock the unprecedented capabilities of JWST/NIRISS AMI, with sensitivity to significantly colder, lower-mass exoplanets than lower-contrast ground-based AMI setups, at orbital separations inaccessible to JWST coronagraphy., The Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) is a $2-5~\mu$m, high-contrast integral field spectrograph (IFS) currently being built for Keck Observatory. With both low ($R\lesssim250$) and medium ($R\sim3500-7000$) spectral resolution IFS modes, SCALES will detect and characterize significantly colder exoplanets than those accessible with near-infrared ($\sim1-2~\mu$m) high-contrast spectrographs. This will lead to new progress in exoplanet atmospheric studies, including detailed characterization of benchmark systems that will advance the state of the art of atmospheric modeling. SCALES' unique modes, while designed specifically for direct exoplanet characterization, will enable a broader range of novel (exo)planetary observations as well as galactic and extragalactic studies. Here we present the science cases that drive the design of SCALES. We describe an end-to-end instrument simulator that we use to track requirements, and show simulations of expected science yields for each driving science case. We conclude with a discussion of preparations for early science when the instrument sees first light in $\sim2025$., We present the highest-angular-resolution infrared monitoring of LkCa 15, a young solar analog hosting a transition disk. This system has been the subject of a number of direct-imaging studies from the millimeter through the optical, which have revealed multiple protoplanetary disk rings as well as three orbiting protoplanet candidates detected in infrared continuum emission (one of which was simultaneously seen at Hα). We use high-angular-resolution infrared imaging from 2014 to 2020 to systematically monitor these infrared signals and determine their physical origin. We find that three self-luminous protoplanets cannot explain the positional evolution of the infrared sources since the longer time baseline images lack the coherent orbital motion that would be expected for companions. However, the data still strongly prefer a time-variable morphology that cannot be reproduced by static scattered-light disk models. The multiepoch observations suggest the presence of complex and dynamic substructures moving through the forward-scattering side of the disk at ~20 au or quickly varying shadowing by closer-in material. We explore whether the previous Hα detection of one candidate would be inconsistent with this scenario and in the process develop an analytical signal-to-noise penalty for Hα excesses detected near forward-scattered light. Under these new noise considerations, the Hα detection is not strongly inconsistent with forward scattering, making the dynamic LkCa 15 disk a natural explanation for both the infrared and Hα data., We will present an overview of the Santa Cruz Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES), a 2-5 micron, adaptive optics fed integral field spectrograph currently being developed for Keck., Herbig Ae/Be stars represent the early outcomes of star formation and the initial stages of planet formation at intermediate stellar masses. Understanding both of these processes requires detailed characterization of their disk structures and companion frequencies. We present new 3.7 μm imaging of the Herbig Be star MWC 297 from nonredundant masking observations on the phase-controlled, 23 m Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. The images reveal complex disk structure on the scales of several au, as well as a companion candidate. We discuss physical interpretations for these features and demonstrate that the imaging results are independent of choices such as priors, regularization hyperparameters, and error-bar estimates. With an angular resolution of ∼17 mas, these data provide the first robust Extremely Large Telescope-resolution view of a distant young star., We present new 0.6-4 μm imaging of the SR 21 transition disk from Keck/NIRC2 and Magellan/MagAO. The protoplanetary disk around SR 21 has a large (∼30-40 au) clearing first inferred from its spectral energy distribution and later detected in submillimeter imaging. Both the gas and small dust grains are known to have a different morphology, with an inner truncation in CO at ∼7 au, and micron-sized dust detected within the millimeter clearing. Previous near-infrared imaging could not distinguish between an inner dust disk with a truncation at ∼7 au or one that extended to the sublimation radius. The imaging data presented here require an inner dust disk radius of a few au, and complex structure such as a warp or spiral. We present a parametric warped disk model that can reproduce the observations. Reconciling the images with the spectral energy distribution gathered from the literature suggests grain growth to ≳2-5 μm within the submillimeter clearing. The complex disk structure and possible grain growth can be connected to dynamical shaping by a giant-planet-mass companion, a scenario supported by previous observational and theoretical studies., Constraining the details of giant planet formation requires building a census of forming planets and characterizing protoplanetary disks. This whitepaper describes the scientific progress in observational planet formation studies that will be made possible by instrumentation advances during the next decade., The limitations of adaptive optics and coronagraph performance make exoplanet detection close to λ / D extremely difficult with conventional imaging methods. The technique of nonredundant masking (NRM), which turns a filled aperture into an interferometric array, has pushed the planet detection parameter space to within λ / D. For high Strehl, the related filled-aperture kernel phase technique can achieve resolution comparable to NRM, without the associated dramatic decrease in throughput. We present NRM and kernel phase contrast curves generated for ground- and space-based instruments. We use both real and simulated observations to assess the performance of each technique, and discuss their capabilities for different exoplanet science goals such as broadband detection and spectral characterization., Understanding the details of the planet formation process requires direct observations of protoplanets themselves. The distances to nearby young stars make these detections extremely difficult, pushing the limits of current facilities. However, instrumentation improvements have enabled the detection of some protoplanet candidates. I will discuss the candidates discovered so far, as well as the techniques that led to their detection. I will also discuss the expected advances in protoplanet detection and characterization from next-generation facilities., The limitations of adaptive optics and coronagraph performance make exoplanet detection close to λ/D extremely difficult with conventional imaging methods. The technique of non-redundant masking (NRM), which turns a filled aperture into an interferometric array, has pushed the planet detection parameter space to within λ/D. For high Strehl, the related filled-aperture kernel phase technique can achieve resolution comparable to NRM, without a dramatic decrease in throughput. We present non-redundant masking and kernel phase contrast curves generated for ground- and space-based instruments. We use both real and simulated observations to assess the performance of each technique, and discuss their capabilities for different exoplanet science goals such as broadband detection and spectral characterization., The technique of non-redundant masking (NRM) transforms a conventional telescope into an interferometric array. In practice, this provides a much better constrained point-spread function than a filled aperture and thus higher resolution than traditional imaging methods. Here, we describe an NRM data reduction pipeline. We discuss strategies for NRM observations regarding dithering patterns and calibrator selection. We describe relevant image calibrations and use example Large Binocular Telescope data sets to show their effects on the scatter in the Fourier measurements. We also describe the various ways to calculate Fourier quantities, and discuss different calibration strategies. We present the results of image reconstructions from simulated observations where we adjust prior images, weighting schemes, and error bar estimation. We compare two imaging algorithms and discuss implications for reconstructing images from real observations. Finally, we explore how the current state of the art compares to next-generation Extremely Large Telescopes., We present new spatially resolved observations of MWC 349A from the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI), a 23 m baseline interferometer made up of two, co-mounted 8 m telescopes. MWC 349A is a B[e] star with an unknown evolutionary state. Proposed scenarios range from a young stellar object, to a B[e] supergiant, to a tight binary system. Radio continuum and recombination line observations of this source revealed a sub-arcsecond bipolar outflow surrounding an ∼100 mas circumstellar disk. Follow-up infrared studies detected the disk, and suggested that it may have skew and an inner clearing. Our new infrared interferometric observations, which have more than twice the resolution of previously published data sets, support the presence of both skew and a compact infrared excess. They rule out inner clearings with radii greater than ∼14 mas. We show the improvements in disk parameter constraints provided by LBTI, and discuss the inferred disk parameters in the context of the posited evolutionary states for MWC 349A., Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings, are promising objects in which to directly image forming planets. The high contrast imaging technique of non-redundant masking is well posed to detect planetary mass companions at several to tens of AU in nearby transition disks. We present non-redundant masking observations of the T Cha and LkCa 15 transition disks, both of which host posited sub-stellar mass companions. However, due to a loss of information intrinsic to the technique, observations of extended sources (e.g. scattered light from disks) can be misinterpreted as moving companions. We discuss tests to distinguish between these two scenarios, with applications to the T Cha and LkCa 15 observations. We argue that a static, forward-scattering disk can explain the T Cha data, while LkCa 15 is best explained by multiple orbiting companions., Exoplanet detections have revolutionized astronomy, offering new insights into solar system architecture and planet demographics. While nearly 1,900 exoplanets have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian orbits. We directly detect Hα emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b, evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an accreting protoplanet., We present multi-epoch non-redundant masking observations of the T Cha transition disk, taken at the Very Large Telescope and Magellan in the H, Ks, and L' bands. T Cha is one of a small number of transition disks that host companion candidates discovered by high-resolution imaging techniques, with a putative companion at a position angle of 78°, separation of 62 mas, and contrast of ΔL' = 5.1 mag. We find comparable binary parameters in our re-reduction of the initial detection images, and similar parameters in the 2011 L', 2013 NaCo L', and 2013 NaCo Ks data sets. We find a close-in companion signal in the 2012 NaCo L' data set that cannot be explained by orbital motion, and a non-detection in the 2013 MagAO/Clio2 L' data. However, Monte Carlo simulations show that the best fits to the 2012 NaCo and 2013 MagAO/Clio2 followup data may be consistent with noise. There is also a significant probability of false non-detections in both of these data sets. We discuss physical scenarios that could cause the best fits, and argue that previous companion and scattering explanations are inconsistent with the results of the much larger data set presented here.","['2024ApJ...963L...2S', 'arXiv:2310.11499', '10.3847/2041-8213/ad21fb', '2023arXiv231011499S', '10.48550/arXiv.2310.11499', 'arXiv:2310.07134', '10.48550/arXiv.2310.07134', '2023arXiv231007134S', '2023arXiv230615069S', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.15069', 'arXiv:2306.15069', '2023ApJ...953...55S', '10.3847/1538-4357/ace16c', '2021LPI....52.2412S', 'arXiv:2011.07082', '2020arXiv201107082S', '10.3847/1538-3881/abc957', '2021AJ....161...28S', '10.48550/arXiv.2011.07082', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab3dae', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.07427', 'arXiv:1908.07427', '2019ApJ...883..100S', '2019arXiv190807427S', 'arXiv:1903.05319', '2019BAAS...51c.527S', '2019astro2020T.527S', '10.48550/arXiv.1903.05319', '2019arXiv190305319S', '10.1117/1.JATIS.5.1.018001', '10.48550/arXiv.1901.01266', 'arXiv:1901.01266', '2019arXiv190101266S', '2019JATIS...5a8001S', '2018cosp...42E2953S', '10.1117/12.2313814', '2018SPIE10701E..1DS', '2017arXiv171001734S', '10.3847/1538-4365/aa90bb', '2017ApJS..233....9S', 'arXiv:1710.01734', '10.48550/arXiv.1710.01734', '2017ApJ...844...22S', '10.48550/arXiv.1706.05010', 'arXiv:1706.05010', '2017arXiv170605010S', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa7855', '2016SPIE.9907E..0DS', '10.48550/arXiv.1609.02559', '10.1117/12.2231764', '2016arXiv160902559S', 'arXiv:1609.02559', '10.1038/nature15761', '10.48550/arXiv.1511.07456', '2015arXiv151107456S', '2015Natur.527..342S', 'arXiv:1511.07456', '10.1088/0004-637X/801/2/85', '10.48550/arXiv.1501.01964', '2015ApJ...801...85S', '2015arXiv150101964S', 'arXiv:1501.01964']","[('disk', 31), ('observation', 20), ('detection', 16), ('companion', 15), ('data', 15), ('imaging', 14), ('present', 13), ('infrared', 13), ('planet', 13), ('discus', 11)]","[(('transition', 'disk'), 9), (('data', 'set'), 7), (('redundant', 'masking'), 6), (('protoplanetary', 'disk'), 5), (('planet', 'formation'), 5), (('filled', 'aperture'), 5), (('adaptive', 'optic'), 4), (('kernel', 'phase'), 4), (('niriss', 'ami'), 3), (('contrast', 'curve'), 3)]","[(('large', 'binocular', 'telescope'), 3), (('technique', 'redundant', 'masking'), 3), (('point', 'spread', 'function'), 2), (('array', 'lenslets', 'exoplanet'), 2), (('lenslets', 'exoplanet', 'spectroscopy'), 2), (('exoplanet', 'spectroscopy', 'scales'), 2), (('mu', 'high', 'contrast'), 2), (('integral', 'field', 'spectrograph'), 2), (('angular', 'resolution', 'infrared'), 2), (('binocular', 'telescope', 'interferometer'), 2)]",Dirty

Disc winds and planet-disc interactions are two crucial mechanisms that define the structure, evolution, and dispersal of protoplanetary discs. While winds are capable of removing material from discs, eventually leading to their dispersal, massive planets can shape their disc by creating sub-structures such as gaps and spiral arms. <BR /> Aims: We studied the interplay between an X-ray photoevaporative disc wind and the sub-structures generated due to planet-disc interactions to determine how their mutual interactions affect the disc's and the planet's evolution. <BR /> Methods: We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of viscous discs (α = 6.9 × 10<SUP>−4</SUP>) that host a Jupiter-like planet and undergo X-ray photoevaporation. We traced the gas flows within the disc and wind and measured the rate of accretion onto the planet, as well as the gravitational torque that is acting on it. <BR /> Results: Our results show that the planetary gap removes the wind's pressure support, allowing wind material to fall back into the gap. This opens new pathways for material from the inner disc (and part of the outer disc) to be redistributed through the wind towards the gap. Consequently, the gap becomes shallower and the flow of mass across the gap in both directions is significantly increased, as is the planet's mass-accretion rate (by factors of ≈5 and ≈2, respectively). Moreover, the wind-driven redistribution results in a denser inner disc and a less dense outer disc, which, combined with the recycling of a significant portion of the inner wind, leads to longer lifetimes for the inner disc, contrary to the expectation in a planet-induced photoevaporation scenario that has been proposed in the past., Drilling in front of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf shall obtain critical knowledge on past, present and future (in)stabilities in the Antarctic Ice Sheet, global sea-level rise, Antarctic bottom-water formation, and global thermohaline circulation., The emergence of active regions on the Sun is an integral feature of the solar dynamo mechanism. However, details about the generation of active-region-scale magnetism and the journey of this magnetic flux from the interior to the photosphere are still in question. Shifting paradigms are now developing for the source depth of the Sun's large-scale magnetism, the organization of this magnetism into fibril flux tubes, and the role of convection in shaping active-region observables. Here we review the landscape of flux emergence theories and simulations, highlight the role flux emergence plays in the global dynamo process, and make connections between flux emergence on the Sun and other cool stars. As longer-term and higher fidelity observations of both solar active regions and their associated flows are amassed, it is now possible to place new constraints on models of emerging flux. We discuss the outcomes of statistical studies which provide observational evidence that flux emergence may be a more passive process (at least in the upper convection zone); dominated to a greater extent by the influence of convection and to a lesser extent by buoyancy and the Coriolis force acting on rising magnetic flux tubes than previously thought. We also discuss how the relationship between stellar rotation, fractional convection zone depth, and magnetic activity on other stars can help us better understand the flux emergence processes. Looking forward, we identify open questions regarding magnetic flux emergence that we anticipate can be addressed in the next decade with further observations and simulations., STEM education in the Mississippi Delta is at a critical juncture, as public schools do not have adequate resources to engage students in STEM activities. As a result, students find themselves increasingly removed from the world of science and struggle to see themselves in STEM careers. Within astronomy, planetaria are unique, immersive tools to engage both students and the public in STEM education. The advancement of digital planetarium systems now affords the opportunity to utilize the dome for more than just stargazing, including content related to earth science, physics, chemistry, biology, aviation, and more. The Wiley Planetarium at Delta State University in rural Cleveland, Mississippi reaches ~10,000 people annually through our public outreach and PreK-college level science education programming, nearly equaling the population of the city of Cleveland itself. We will share both the trials and tribulations we have encountered as we pilot a program that engages local middle school students and teachers in earth and space science related content through the Wiley Planetarium. The content we deliver for this program is mapped to learning outcomes for individual grade levels and aligned with the Mississippi College and Career Readiness Science Standards. Additionally, we will discuss the positive impact our planetarium has made on the surrounding community and the general education astronomy course at Delta State University., Across the majority of STEM fields, women are historically under-represented. One way we can begin to address this disparity is by bringing women to the forefront of scientific conversation and debate. Through an international initiative called Soapbox Science, we challenge the typical stereotype of 'Who is a scientist?' by providing an outreach platform that brings women scientists to city streets to engage in a discourse with the public about their research. Soapbox Science originated in London, England in 2011. The original event was modeled after Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park London, where concerned citizens stood on literal soapboxes to engage in open-air public speaking. In 2018, we brought Soapbox Science to the United States for the very first time with our inaugural event at Chicago's iconic Navy Pier. During the summers of 2018 and 2019, women astronomers and scientists took to the streets of Chicago to speak with passers-by about their research - everything from black hole collisions to planet habitability to finding a cure for cancer. Between the summers of 2018 and 2019, our two Chicago Soapbox Science events received more than 1000 visitors and provided science communication training for 24 local early career women scientists. Audience evaluations we conducted reported that more than 90% of attendees felt the event was 'very effective' at promoting the participation of women in STEM. We will share our lessons learned about large-scale public outreach events, best practices for sustainability, and highlight the impact Soapbox Science has made on our speakers in particular., Our universe is inherently three-dimensional in nature, yet even within the planetarium experience, it is largely presented with two-dimensional imagery. At Adler Planetarium in Chicago, we have developed a new program called 'Touch the Universe'. This program utilizes 3D printed astrophysical objects in combination with visualizations to provide museum guests with a new way of exploring space and science concepts. Our project goals are three-fold: to encourage curiosity and exploration through multiple senses, to explore new avenues to present astrophysical data via 3D printed objects, and to provide more opportunities for engagement among our guests with visual or cognitive impairment and those that are primarily tactile learners. This programming is delivered within Adler Planetarium's Space Visualization Lab (SVL), a unique space where local astrophysicists present their latest discoveries with immersive technologies in intimate conversations with museum guests. 'Touch the Universe' presenters come from a pool of more than 70 volunteers, all provided with science communication training by Adler Planetarium. Working with our SVL volunteers, we identify the stories they want to tell about the universe and source related visualizations and 3D printed objects. Many of these stories have ties to Chicago-area institutions and Adler programs. Sometimes we make use of already available resources online, but often Adler Planetarium staff and the scientists themselves develop the associated visualizations or provide data to create new 3D printed objects. To facilitate the sharing of our material and the duplication of our program by other organizations, we make all of our materials available online via GitHub. Implementation of 'Touch the Universe' within Adler's Space Visualization Lab has led to increased audience interaction and enquiry, making astronomy accessible to a broader audience., Helioseismology has revealed that the solar differential rotation profile exhibits an outward decrease in angular velocity at all latitudes across the upper 5% of the Sun by radius. This near-surface shear layer (NSSL) is thought to play a significant role in defining the nature of large-scale convective patterns that drive the Sun's magnetism. Previous work has been done to study the mechanisms that establish the solar NSSL, but in large part these processes remain elusive. It is expected that NSSLs also exist on other low mass stars, but observing such layers directly is currently beyond our capabilities and little work has been done to explore them theoretically. To address this, we have performed simulations of compressible convective motions in the thin, near surface layers of cool stars using the Compressible Spherical Segment (CSS) Code. Results from these models indicate that the influence of rotation on smaller-scale convection, quantified by the Rossby number, has an influence on the flow patterns that are sustained in the thin NSSL. As the star is spun faster or the convective driving is reduced (i.e. smaller Rossby number), the shear across the layer is also reduced. In the most extreme cases with the lowest Rossby numbers, Jupiter-like alternating bands of zonal flows are found. Counterparts to these behaviors have been found previously in simulations of deep stellar convection, where the redistribution of angular momentum via the Reynolds stresses and meridional circulation act to establish the unique differential rotation profile. Additionally, our simulations of near-surface convection representative of the Sun overestimate the radial shear observed across the NSSL. One possible explanation is that the shear in the solar NSSL is not self-sustained, but rather driven by the inflow of convective plumes and the imprint of rotational torques from deeper layers into the shallower NSSL., Our understanding of stellar dynamos has largely been driven by the phenomena we have observed of our own Sun. Yet, as we amass longer-term datasets for an increasing number of stars, it is clear that there is a wide variety of stellar behavior. Here we briefly review observed trends that place key constraints on the fundamental dynamo operation of solar-type stars to fully convective M dwarfs, including: starspot and sunspot patterns, various magnetism-rotation correlations, and mean field flows such as differential rotation and meridional circulation. We also comment on the current insight that simulations of dynamo action and flux emergence lend to our working knowledge of stellar dynamo theory. While the growing landscape of both observations and simulations of stellar magnetic activity work in tandem to decipher dynamo action, there are still many puzzles that we have yet to fully understand., Starspots are windows into a star’s internal dynamo mechanism. However, the manner by which the dynamo-generated magnetic field traverses the stellar interior to emerge at the surface is not especially well understood. Establishing the details of magnetic flux emergence plays a key role in deciphering stellar dynamos and observed starspot properties. In the solar context, insight into this process has been obtained by assuming the magnetism giving rise to sunspots consists partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Here, we present three sets of TFT simulations in rotating spherical shells of convection: one representative of the Sun, the second of a solar-like rapid rotator, and the third of a fully convective M dwarf. Our solar simulations reproduce sunspot observables such as low-latitude emergence, tilting action toward the equator following the Joy’s Law trend, and a phenomenon akin to active longitudes. Further, we compare the evolution of rising flux tubes in our (computationally inexpensive) TFT simulations to buoyant magnetic structures that arise naturally in a unique global simulation of a rapidly rotating Sun. We comment on the role of rapid rotation, the Coriolis force, and external torques imparted by the surrounding convection in establishing the trajectories of the flux tubes across the convection zone. In our fully convective M dwarf simulations, the expected starspot latitudes deviate from the solar trend, favoring significantly poleward latitudes unless the differential rotation is sufficiently prograde or the magnetic field is strongly super-equipartition. Together our work provides a link between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, turbulent convection, and observations of starspots along the lower main sequence., Evidence of surface magnetism is now observed on an increasing number of cool stars. The detailed manner by which dynamo-generated magnetic fields giving rise to starspots traverse the convection zone still remains unclear. Some insight into this flux emergence mechanism has been gained by assuming bundles of magnetic field can be represented by idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Weber &amp; Browning (2016) have recently investigated how individual flux tubes might evolve in a 0.3M<SUB>⊙</SUB> M dwarf by effectively embedding TFTs in time-dependent flows representative of a fully convective star. We expand upon this work by initiating flux tubes at various depths in the upper ~50-75% of the star in order to sample the differing convective flow pattern and differential rotation across this region. Specifically, we comment on the role of differential rotation and time-varying flows in both the suppression and promotion of the magnetic flux emergence process., In the solar context, important insight into the flux emergence process has been obtained by assuming the magnetism giving rise to sunspots consists partly of idealized flux tubes. Global-scale dynamo models are only now beginning to capture some aspects of flux emergence. In certain regimes, these simulations self-consistently generate magnetic flux structures that rise buoyantly through the computational domain. How similar are these dynamo-generated, rising flux structures to traditional flux tube models? The work we present here is a step toward addressing this question. We utilize the thin flux tube (TFT) approximation to simply model the evolution of flux tubes in a global, three-dimensional geometry. The TFTs are embedded in convective flows taken from a global dynamo simulation of a rapidly rotating Sun within which buoyant flux structures arise naturally from wreaths of magnetism. The initial conditions of the TFTs are informed by rising flux structures identified in the dynamo simulation. We compare the trajectories of the dynamo-generated flux loops with those computed through the TFT approach. We also assess the nature of the relevant forces acting on both sets of flux structures, such as buoyancy, the Coriolis force, and external forces imparted by the surrounding convection. To achieve the fast &lt;15 day rise of the buoyant flux structures, we must suppress the large retrograde flow established inside the TFTs which occurs due to a strong conservation of angular momentum as they move outward. This tendency is common in flux tube models in solar-like convection zones, but is not present to the same degree in the dynamo-generated flux loops. We discuss the mechanisms that may be responsible for suppressing the axial flow inside the flux tube, and consider the implications this has regarding the role of the Coriolis force in explaining sunspot latitudes and the observed Joy’s Law trend of active regions. Our work aims to provide constraints, and possible calibrations, on the traditional flux tube model as it pertains to the Sun and other spotted stars., , Many fully convective stars exhibit a wide variety of surface magnetism, including starspots and chromospheric activity. The manner by which bundles of magnetic field traverse portions of the convection zone to emerge at the stellar surface is not especially well understood. In the solar context, some insight into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as consisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Here we present the results of a large set of TFT simulations in a rotating spherical domain of convective flows representative of a 0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> main-sequence star. This is the first study to investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star might rise under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and differential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective flow field, taken from separate 3D simulations calculated with the anelastic equations, impacts the flux tube as it rises. Convective motions modulate the shape of the initially buoyant flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in fully convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the rotation axis. However, the presence of strong differential rotation allows some initially low-latitude flux tubes of moderate strength to develop rising loops that emerge in the near-equatorial region. Magnetic pumping suppresses the global rise of the flux tube most efficiently in the deeper interior and at lower latitudes. The results of these simulations aim to provide a link between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, fluid motions, and observations of starspots for fully convective stars., Thuillier et al. (Solar Phys., 2015, DOI:10.1007/s11207-015-0704-1) discuss the apparent discrepancy between the ATLAS-3 composite solar spectral irradiances (SSI) covering the ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (NIR) spectral region with more recent SSI measurements in the NIR. Recent measurements from IRSPERAD, CAVIAR, SCIAMACHY, SOLSPEC/ISS (the SOLAR2 spectrum from 2008), and unadjusted SIM show that above about 1600 nm, SSI is lower by about 8 % with respect to ATLAS-3. A new correction is presented in Thuillier et al. (2015) that leads to SOLSPEC/ISS (SOLAR2rev) which is in better agreement with ATLAS-3. SOLSPEC/ISS SSI underwent a +10 % change from 2008 to 2010, leading to better agreement with ATLAS-3, but it remains unclear which year provided the proper radiometric level, 2008 (SOLAR2) or 2010 (SOLAR2rev) as no link to pre-launch calibration is established. Before interpreting the NIR SSI observations using our current physical understanding (constraints by the total solar irradiance and solar models), the cause for the discrepancy between the early ATLAS-3 and all recent measurements (without a-posteriori adjustments) needs to be understood considering instrument and calibration performance alone., We study the combined effects of convection and radiative diffusion on the evolution of thin magnetic flux tubes in the solar interior. Radiative diffusion is the primary supplier of heat to convective motions in the lower convection zone, and it results in a heat input per unit volume of magnetic flux tubes that has been ignored by many previous thin flux tube studies. We use a thin flux tube model subject to convection taken from a rotating spherical shell of turbulent, solar-like convection as described by Weber, Fan, and Miesch (Astrophys. J.741, 11, 2011; Solar Phys.287, 239, 2013), now taking into account the influence of radiative heating on 10<SUP>22</SUP> Mx flux tubes, corresponding to flux tubes of large active regions. Our simulations show that flux tubes of ≤ 60 kG that are subject to solar-like convective flows do not anchor in the overshoot region, but rather drift upward because of the increased buoyancy of the flux tube earlier in its evolution, which results from including radiative diffusion. Flux tubes of magnetic field strengths ranging from 15 kG to 100 kG have rise times of ≤ 0.2 years and exhibit a Joy's Law tilt-angle trend. Our results suggest that radiative heating is an effective mechanism by which flux tubes can escape from the stably stratified overshoot region. Moreover, flux tubes do not necessarily need to be anchored in the overshoot region to produce emergence properties similar to those of active regions on the Sun., The Sun exhibits cyclic properties of its large-scale magnetic field on the order of sigma22 years, with a ∼11 year frequency of sunspot occurrence. These sunspots, or active regions, are the centers of magnetically driven phenomena such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Volatile solar magnetic events directed toward the Earth pose a threat to human activities and our increasingly technological society. As such, the origin and nature of solar magnetic flux emergence is a topic of global concern. Sunspots are observable manifestations of solar magnetic fields, thus providing a photospheric link to the deep-seated dynamo mechanism. However, the manner by which bundles of magnetic field, or flux tubes, traverse the convection zone to eventual emergence at the solar surface is not well understood. To provide a connection between dynamo-generated magnetic fields and sunspots, I have performed simulations of magnetic flux emergence through the bulk of a turbulent, solar convective envelope by employing a thin flux tube model subject to interaction with flows taken from a hydrodynamic convection simulation computed through the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic (ASH) code. The convective velocity field interacts with the flux tube through the drag force it experiences as it traverses through the convecting medium. Through performing these simulations, much insight has been gained about the influence of turbulent solar-like convection on the flux emergence process and resulting active region properties. I find that the dynamic evolution of flux tubes change from convection dominated to magnetic buoyancy dominated as the initial field strength of the flux tubes increases from 15 kG to 100 kG. Additionally, active-region-scale flux tubes of 40 kG and greater exhibit properties similar to those of active regions on the Sun, such as: tilt angles, rotation rates, and morphological asymmetries. The joint effect of the Coriolis force and helical motions present in convective upflows help tilt the apex of rising flux tubes toward the equator in accordance with Joys Law. Utilizing these simulations, I find that rotationally aligned, columnar convective structures called giant cells present near the equatorial regions of the ASH simulation organizes flux emergence into a large-scale longitudinal pattern similar to the active longitude trend on the Sun and other solar-like stars. The effect of radiative diffusion across the radiation zone-convection zone interface on the buoyant rise of magnetic flux tubes is also studied. Incorporating this effect into the flux tube model, flux tubes with magnetic field strengths of 60 kG or less no longer anchor in the stably stratified overshoot region. These flux tubes still have average emergence properties that agree with observations of solar active regions, although tilt angles have a larger scatter about the mean value. Finally, I will discuss possible future research problems that can be investigated through the thin flux tube approach, such as convection-induced twisting of the flux tube magnetic field lines and flux emergence properties on a young Sun rotating at 5 times the current solar rate., The manner by which bundles of magnetic field, or flux tubes, traverse the convection zone to eventual emergence at the solar surface is not well understood. To provide a connection between dynamo-generated magnetic fields and sunspots, I have performed simulations of magnetic flux emergence through the bulk of a turbulent, solar convective envelope by employing a thin flux tube model subject to interaction with flows taken from a hydrodynamic convection simulation computed through the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic (ASH) code.

Additionally, active-region-scale flux tubes of 40 kG and greater exhibit properties similar to those of active regions on the Sun, such as: tilt angles, rotation rates, and morphological asymmetries. The joint effect of the Coriolis force and helical motions present in convective upflows help tilt the apex of rising flux tubes toward the equator in accordance with Joy’s Law. Additionally, rotationally aligned, columnar convective structures called giant cells present in the ASH simulation organizes flux emergence into a large-scale longitudinal pattern similar to the active longitude trend on the Sun and other solar-like stars. The effect of radiative diffusion across the radiation zone-convection zone interface on the buoyant rise of magnetic flux tubes is also studied, as well as the possibility of an induced twist of flux tube magnetic fields lines due to the Coriolis force induced tilting of the flux tube apex, presence of turbulent convection, and the conservation of helicity. Flux emergence simulations through the convection zone of a Sun rotating at 5 times the current solar rate are also conducted to explore the rotation-convection relationship as it relates to flux emergence., We study how active-region-scale flux tubes rise buoyantly from the base of the convection zone to near the solar surface by embedding a thin flux tube model in a rotating spherical shell of solar-like turbulent convection. These toroidal flux tubes that we simulate range in magnetic field strength from 15 kG to 100 kG at initial latitudes of 1<SUP>∘</SUP> to 40<SUP>∘</SUP> in both hemispheres. This article expands upon Weber, Fan, and Miesch (Astrophys. J.741, 11, 2011) (Article 1) with the inclusion of tubes with magnetic flux of 10<SUP>20</SUP> Mx and 10<SUP>21</SUP> Mx, and more simulations of the previously investigated case of 10<SUP>22</SUP> Mx, sampling more convective flows than the previous article, greatly improving statistics. Observed properties of active regions are compared to properties of the simulated emerging flux tubes, including: the tilt of active regions in accordance with Joy's Law as in Article 1, and in addition the scatter of tilt angles about the Joy's Law trend, the most commonly occurring tilt angle, the rotation rate of the emerging loops with respect to the surrounding plasma, and the nature of the magnetic field at the flux tube apex. We discuss how these diagnostic properties constrain the initial field strength of the active-region flux tubes at the bottom of the solar convection zone, and suggest that flux tubes of initial magnetic field strengths of ≥ 40 kG are good candidates for the progenitors of large (10<SUP>21</SUP> Mx to 10<SUP>22</SUP> Mx) solar active regions, which agrees with the results from Article 1 for flux tubes of 10<SUP>22</SUP> Mx. With the addition of more magnetic flux values and more simulations, we find that for all magnetic field strengths, the emerging tubes show a positive Joy's Law trend, and that this trend does not show a statistically significant dependence on the magnetic flux., Using a thin flux tube model in a rotating spherical shell of turbulent, solar-like convection, we find that the distribution of emerging flux tubes in our simulation is inhomogeneous in longitude, with properties similar to those of active longitudes on the Sun and other solar-like stars. The large-scale pattern of flux emergence our simulations produce exhibit preferred longitudinal modes of low order, drift with respect to a fixed reference system, and show alignment at low latitudes within 15 degrees on either side of the equator. We suggest that these active-longitude-like emergence patterns are the result of columnar, rotationally aligned giant cells present in our convection simulation at low latitudes. If giant convecting cells exist in the bulk of the solar convection zone, this phenomenon, along with differential rotation, could in part provide an explanation for the existence and behavior of active longitudes., Using a thin flux tube model in a rotating spherical shell of turbulent, solar-like convection, we find that the distribution of emerging flux tubes in our simulation is inhomogeneous in longitude, with properties similar to those of active longitudes on the Sun and other solar-like stars.

The STELLA Échelle spectrograph (SES) along with the building has been in operation successfully since 2006, and is producing spectra covering the visual wavelength range between 390 and 870 nm at a spectral resolution of 55~000. The stability of the spectrograph over the entire two year span, measured by monitoring 15 radial velocity standard stars, is 30 to 150 m/s rms. The Wide-field stellar imager and photometer (WIFSIP) was put into operation in 2010, when the SES-lightfeed was physically moved to the second telescope. We will give an overview of the main scientific topics of the bulk of the observing programs., Solar observations show that the emergence of active features is distributed inhomogeneously in longitude according to sunspot activity, solar x-ray flares, and coronal streamers. In addition, an asymmetry exists between active region associated phenomena in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Using a thin flux tube model in a rotating spherical shell of solar-like convective flows, we find that these simulated flux tubes tend to emerge asymmetri","['10.1051/0004-6361/202348596', 'arXiv:2402.12053', '10.48550/arXiv.2402.12053', '2024A&A...686A..53W', '2024arXiv240212053W', '2024LPICo3013.6017W', '2023arXiv230606536W', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.06536', '10.1007/s11214-023-01006-5', 'arXiv:2306.06536', '2023SSRv..219...63W', '2020AAS...23523905W', '2020AAS...23513505W', '2019AAS...23342701W', '2019AAS...23337001W', '2018IAUS..340..275W', '10.48550/arXiv.1804.05904', '10.1017/S1743921318001424', '2018arXiv180405904W', 'arXiv:1804.05904', '2018AAS...23115811W', '10.1017/S1743921317003830', '2017arXiv170304982W', '2017IAUS..328...85W', '10.48550/arXiv.1703.04982', 'arXiv:1703.04982', '2017SPD....4840301W', '2017ehep.confE.770W', '10.22323/1.314.0770', '2017PoS...314E.770W', '2016ApJ...827...95W', '2016arXiv160600380W', '10.3847/0004-637X/827/2/95', 'arXiv:1606.00380', '10.48550/arXiv.1606.00380', '2015SoPh..tmp...77W', '2015SoPh..290.1601W', '10.1007/s11207-015-0707-y', '10.1007/s11207-015-0674-3', '10.48550/arXiv.1503.08034', '2015SoPh..290.1295W', '2015arXiv150308034W', 'arXiv:1503.08034', '2015SoPh..tmp...33W', '2014PhDT........85W', '2014AAS...22421101W', '2012arXiv1208.1292W', '10.1007/s11207-012-0093-7', 'arXiv:1208.1292', '2013SoPh..287..239W', '10.48550/arXiv.1208.1292', '2012SoPh..tmp..208W', '2013SPD....4420403W', '2013shin.confE..42W', '2013AAS...22230403W', '2013ApJ...770..149W', 'arXiv:1305.1904', '10.48550/arXiv.1305.1904', '10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/149', '2013arXiv1305.1904W', '2013POBeo..92...21W', '2012AGUFMSH41D2126W', '2012apsp.conf..402W', '10.1142/9789814405072_0059', '2012shin.confE..36W', '2012AAS...22020109W', '2012ASInC...7..165W', '2011AGUFMSH41B..05W', '2011AGUFMGC22A..04W', '10.1088/0004-637X/741/1/11', '10.48550/arXiv.1109.0240', '2011arXiv1109.0240W', 'arXiv:1109.0240', '2011ApJ...741...11W', '2011APS..4CF.M4002W', '2011shin.confE...6W', '10.1051/0004-6361/201116885', '2011arXiv1104.0342W', '2011A&A...531A..89W', 'arXiv:1104.0342', '10.48550/arXiv.1104.0342', '2011BAAS..43S.0206W', '2011SPD....42.0206W', '2011yCat..35310089W', '10.26093/cds/vizier.35310089', '2011yCat..35319089W', '2010AGUFMSH42A..03W', '2009arXiv0910.4272W', '2010A&A...509A..25W', '10.48550/arXiv.0910.4272', 'arXiv:0910.4272', '10.1051/0004-6361/200913381', '2009ASPC..415...32W', '2009MmSAI..80..743W', '10.22323/1.097.0014', '2009PoS....97E..14W', '2009cse..workE..14W', '2008AGUSMSP51B..08W', '10.1002/asna.200710869', '2007AN....328.1075W', '2007ASPC..369...63W', '2007iwvd.confE..37W', '10.22323/1.057.0037', '2007PoS....57E..37W', '2006IAUJD...8E..30W', '2005AGUFMSH13A0280W', '10.1086/499125', '2005ApJ...635L.101W', '2005AGUSMSP13B..03W', '2005AN....326..287W', '10.1002/asna.200410391', '2005csss...13.1029W', '2005ESASP.560.1029W', '2005csss...13.1025W', '2005ESASP.560.1025W', '2005JIMO...33...21W', '10.1002/asna.200410289', '2004AN....325..598W', '2004acve.conf...27W', '2004ESASP.562E..27W', '2004BAAS...36..795W', '2004AAS...204.6906W', '2004GeoJI.156..655W', '10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02143.x', '10.1017/S1743921304006088', '2005IAUS..223..321W', '2004IAUS..223..321W', '2003csss...12..922W', '2003GeoRL..30k..37W', '2003GeoRL..30.1583W', '10.1029/2002GL016799', '2003SPD....34.1704W', '2003BAAS...35..838W']","[('flux', 165), ('tube', 116), ('solar', 114), ('convection', 90), ('active', 76), ('magnetic', 65), ('region', 64), ('field', 62), ('simulation', 55), ('loop', 49)]","[(('flux', 'tube'), 114), (('active', 'region'), 45), (('convection', 'zone'), 37), (('field', 'strength'), 31), (('magnetic', 'field'), 30), (('flux', 'emergence'), 27), (('differential', 'rotation'), 26), (('thin', 'flux'), 26), (('active', 'longitude'), 25), (('tube', 'model'), 24)]","[(('thin', 'flux', 'tube'), 23), (('flux', 'tube', 'model'), 18), (('rotating', 'spherical', 'shell'), 15), (('tube', 'model', 'rotating'), 13), (('model', 'rotating', 'spherical'), 13), (('spherical', 'shell', 'turbulent'), 12), (('base', 'convection', 'zone'), 11), (('active', 'region', 'scale'), 10), (('solar', 'active', 'regions'), 9), (('initial', 'field', 'strength'), 9)]",Dirty

The survey obtained ∼530 square arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1–5 μm, totaling ∼192 hr of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes ∼432 square arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least six NIRCam broadband filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ∼60%. Additionally, 70 square arcmin was also covered by a seventh filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data (∼200 square arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a ""wedding cake"" survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5σ point-source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8–29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The ≳6-filter strategy yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS (σ<SUB>NMAD</SUB> ∼ 0.07; η ∼ 0.2), enabling a wealth of science across redshift without need for follow-up or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources across redshifts., Using deep JWST imaging from JADES, JEMS, and SMILES, we characterize optically faint and extremely red galaxies at z &gt; 3 that were previously missing from galaxy census estimates. The data indicate the existence of abundant, dusty, and poststarburst-like galaxies down to 10<SUP>8 </SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, below the sensitivity limit of Spitzer and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Modeling the NIRCam and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of these red sources can result in extremely high values for both stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR); however, including seven MIRI filters out to 21 μm results in decreased masses (median 0.6 dex for <inline-formula> <mml:math overflow=""scroll""><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy=""false"">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⊙</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy=""false"">)</mml:mo></mml:math> </inline-formula> &gt; 10) and SFRs (median 10× for SFR &gt; 100 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>‑1</SUP>). At z &gt; 6, our sample includes a high fraction of ""little red dots"" (LRDs; NIRCam-selected dust-reddened active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates). We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3 μm (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z &gt; 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (L <SUB>IR</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>12 </SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 &lt; z &lt; 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 7.7. While spectroscopy is required to determine their nature, we discuss possible measurement systematics to explore with future data., Quiescent galaxies are the massive remnants of both rapid star-formation in the early Universe, and powerful feedback mechanisms that may truncate star-formation. Understanding these ""quenching"" processes has been a major challenge to building a complete picture of galaxy evolution. I will overview recent results based on ALMA data that seek to characterize the cold ISM of massive quiescent galaxies in the distant Universe, during the first few billion years after the Big Bang. ALMA is revealing an emerging picture of a diversity of evolutionary pathways among galaxies that are ceasing their star-formation at this early epoch, which our theoretical formulations of quenching processes must accommodate. Looking forward, I will discuss future directions where ALMA can further our understanding in its second decade., We present JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey, the first public medium-band imaging survey carried out using JWST/NIRCam and NIRISS. These observations use ~2 and ~4 μm medium-band filters (NIRCam F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M, F480M; and NIRISS F430M and F480M in parallel) over 15.6 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), thereby building on the deepest multiwavelength public data sets available anywhere on the sky. We describe our science goals, survey design, NIRCam and NIRISS image reduction methods, and describe our first data release of the science-ready mosaics, which reach 5σ point-source limits (AB mag) of ~29.3-29.4 in 2 μm filters and ~28.2-28.7 at 4 μm. Our chosen filters create a JWST imaging survey in the UDF that enables novel analysis of a range of spectral features potentially across the redshift range of 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 20, including Paschen-α, Hα+[N II], and [O III]+Hβ emission at high spatial resolution. We find that our JWST medium-band imaging efficiently identifies strong line emitters (medium-band colors &gt;1 mag) across redshifts 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.3, most prominently Hα+[N II] and [O III]+Hβ. We present our first data release including science-ready mosaics of each medium-band image available to the community, adding to the legacy value of past and future surveys in the UDF. This survey demonstrates the power of medium-band imaging with JWST, informing future extragalactic survey strategies using JWST observations., We report the serendipitous discovery of an overdensity of CO emitters in an X-ray-identified cluster (Log<SUB>10</SUB> M <SUB>halo</SUB>/M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ~ 13.6 at z = 1.3188) using ALMA. We present spectroscopic confirmation of six new cluster members exhibiting CO(2-1) emission, adding to two existing optical/IR spectroscopic members undetected in CO. This is the lowest-mass cluster to date at z &gt; 1 with molecular gas measurements, bridging the observational gap between galaxies in the more extreme, well-studied clusters (Log<SUB>10</SUB> M <SUB>halo</SUB>/M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ≳ 14) and those in group or field environments at cosmic noon. The CO sources are concentrated on the sky (within ~1 arcmin diameter) and phase space analysis indicates the gas resides in galaxies already within the cluster environment. We find that CO sources sit in similar phase space as CO-rich galaxies in more massive clusters at similar redshifts (have similar accretion histories) while maintaining field-like molecular gas reservoirs, compared to scaling relations. This work presents the deepest CO survey to date in a galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, uncovering gas reservoirs down to ${M}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\gt 1.6\times {10}^{10}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (5σ at 50% primary beam). Our deep limits rule out the presence of gas content in excess of the field scaling relations; however, combined with literature CO detections, cluster gas fractions in general appear systematically high, on the upper envelope or above the field. This study is the first demonstration that low-mass clusters at z ~ 1-2 can host overdensities of CO emitters with surviving gas reservoirs, in line with the prediction that quenching is delayed after first infall while galaxies consume the gas bound to the disk., Ocean deoxygenation threatens ocean productivity, carbon cycling and marine ecosystems. Shelf seas are highly dynamic regions, which contributes to their high productivity and also makes monitoring and constraining their oxygen status a challenge. Here, using the temperate Celtic shelf sea (April and July 2015) as a case study, we present high-resolution ocean glider observations of turbulence and biogeochemical parameters, demonstrating the potential of these autonomous platforms for environmental monitoring. We estimate vertical turbulent oxygen fluxes be 25% higher in summer than in spring, due to the presence of subsurface chlorophyll and associated oxygen maxima at the seasonal thermocline. We demonstrate that glider-based estimates were able to constrain similar bottom layer respiration rates as those derived from traditional ship-based measurements. We suggest ocean gliders are useful monitoring tools that can aid sustainable management of shelf sea ecosystems., The driver and timeline of the reionization of hydrogen in the early Universe remains a major uncertainty in galaxy formation. As redshift increases, one of the primary observational tracers of ionizing photons, Lyman-alpha (Lya), is attenuated by the increasingly neutral intergalactic medium. In order to circumvent this and understand the production and escape of ionizing photons at the highest redshifts, we propose a novel and efficient JWST imaging survey in the UDF to target H-alpha (Ha) and the UV continuum at z=5.4-6.6 (the tail end of reionization epoch). These medium-band observations (NIRCam F182M, F210M, F430M, F460M, F480M; and NIRISS F430M &amp; F480M in parallel) build on the deepest HST and MUSE data publicly available anywhere. The existing data provide Lya and some UV information at high spatial resolution, but lack the critical constraints on the intrinsic ionizing photon production and dust geometry within such galaxies. Our joint Lya-UV-Ha analysis will provide this information on global and spatially resolved (kpc) scales for the first time in individual, normal star forming galaxies during reionization. This program enables the first unbiased accounting of the ionizing photon production budget via Ha, pinpointing where Lya is initially created, and resolving the uncertainties in current data from galaxy orientation and dust geometry. The proposed data also enable multiple additional science objectives, including the discovery of [OIII]+H-beta emitters at z=7.6-9.3. These data will be public immediately, enabling numerous rapid follow-up studies with JWST, and will enhance the legacy value of past and future surveys in this popular field., Where HST has characterized the UV universe to z=6-7 and beyond, JWST is designed to take the crucial next step and characterize the UV universe to z=12-15 (a factor of 2 in expansion rate), at only ~300 Myr after the Big Bang where we expect the first galaxies to form. Additionally, JWST for the first time allows studies of the restframe optical emission to z=10, a huge leap from the current z=3 (HST). To fully capitalize on JWST's unparalleled imaging AND spectroscopic capabilities, it is critical, however, to find the most precious intrinsically luminous candidate galaxies early in the mission. Large area imaging is thus needed from day one. Here, we propose to exploit the unique opportunity offered by pure parallel observing to efficiently obtain such a wide-area reference survey over 0.4 sq degrees in 6 NIRCam filters. By probing 7x larger area than any other currently planned (GTO/ERS) program our survey will probe a unique discovery space with unprecedented imaging at 1-5micron. These data overcome two major outstanding limitations in our current extragalactic census using yet-undiscovered populations: (1) the brightest and most distant sources that ended the cosmic Dark Ages at z&gt;9 and (2) red sources at 3, We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) spectroscopy of six massive (log<SUB>10</SUB> ${M}_{* }$ / ${M}_{\odot }$ &gt; 11.3) quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 1.5. These data represent the largest sample using CO emission to trace molecular gas in quiescent galaxies above z &gt; 1, achieving an average 3σ sensitivity of ${M}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}$ ∼ 10<SUP>10</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ . We detect one galaxy at 4σ significance and place upper limits on the molecular gas reservoirs of the other five, finding molecular gas mass fractions ${M}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}/{M}_{* }={f}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\lt 2 \% \mbox{--}6 \% $ (3σ upper limits). This is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than coeval star-forming galaxies at similar stellar mass, and comparable to galaxies at z = 0 with similarly low specific star formation rate (sSFR). This indicates that their molecular gas reservoirs were rapidly and efficiently used up or destroyed, and that gas fractions are uniformly low (&lt;6%) despite the structural diversity of our sample. The implied rapid depletion time of molecular gas ( ${t}_{\mathrm{dep}}$ &lt; 0.6 Gyr) disagrees with extrapolations of empirical scaling relations to low sSFR. We find that our low gas fractions are instead in agreement with predictions from both the recent SIMBA cosmological simulation, and from analytical ""bathtub"" models for gas accretion onto galaxies in massive dark matter halos (log ${}_{10}{M}_{\mathrm{halo}}/{M}_{\odot }\sim 14$ at z = 0). Such high mass halos reach a critical mass of log ${}_{10}{M}_{\mathrm{halo}}/{M}_{\odot }\gt 12$ by z ∼ 4 that halt the accretion of baryons early in the universe. Our data are consistent with a simple picture where galaxies truncate accretion and then consume the existing gas at or faster than typical main-sequence rates. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that these galaxies reside in lower mass halos, and low gas fractions may instead reflect either stronger feedback, or more efficient gas consumption., We discuss the serendipitous discovery of a dusty high-redshift galaxy in a small (8 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>) ALMA 3-mm survey Williams et al. (&lt;xref rid=""r29"" ref-type=""bibr""&gt;2019&lt;/xref&gt;). The galaxy was previously unknown and is absent from existing multi-wavelength catalogs (""ALMA-only""). Using the ALMA position as prior, we perform forced deblended photometry to constrain its spectral energy distribution. The spectral energy distribution is well described by a massive (M* = 10<SUP>10.8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and highly obscured (A<SUB>V</SUB> ∼ 4) galaxy at redshift z = 5.5 ± 1.1 with star formation rate ∼ 300 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our small survey area implies an uncertain but large contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density, similar to the contribution from all ultraviolet-selected galaxies combined at this redshift. This galaxy likely traces an abundant population of massive galaxies absent from current samples of infrared-selected or sub-millimeter galaxies, but with larger space densities, higher duty cycles, and significant contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate and stellar mass densities., We report the serendipitous detection of two 3 mm continuum sources found in deep ALMA Band 3 observations to study intermediate-redshift galaxies in the COSMOS field. One is near a foreground galaxy at 1.″3, but is a previously unknown dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at probable z <SUB>CO</SUB> = 3.329, illustrating the risk of misidentifying shorter wavelength counterparts. The optical-to-millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) favors a gray λ <SUP>-0.4</SUP> attenuation curve and results in significantly larger stellar mass and SFR compared to a Calzetti starburst law, suggesting caution when relating progenitors and descendants based on these quantities. The other source is missing from all previous optical/near-infrared/submillimeter/radio catalogs (“ALMA-only”), and remains undetected even in stacked ultradeep optical (&gt;29.6 AB) and near-infrared (&gt;27.9 AB) images. Using the ALMA position as a prior reveals faint signal-to-noise ratio ∼ 3 measurements in stacked IRAC 3.6+4.5, ultradeep SCUBA2 850 μm, and VLA 3 GHz, indicating the source is real. The SED is robustly reproduced by a massive M* = 10<SUP>10.8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and M <SUB>gas</SUB> = 10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, highly obscured A <SUB> V </SUB> ∼ 4, star-forming SFR ∼ 300 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> galaxy at redshift z = 5.5 ± 1.1. The ultrasmall 8 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> survey area implies a large yet uncertain contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density CSFRD(z = 5) ∼ 0.9 × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, comparable to all ultraviolet-selected galaxies combined. These results indicate the existence of a prominent population of DSFGs at z &gt; 4, below the typical detection limit of bright galaxies found in single-dish submillimeter surveys, but with larger space densities ∼3 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, higher duty cycles of 50%-100%, contributing more to the CSFRD, and potentially dominating the high-mass galaxy stellar mass function., , We present an original phenomenological model to describe the evolution of galaxy number counts, morphologies, and spectral energy distributions across a wide range of redshifts (0.2&lt; z&lt; 15) and stellar masses [{log}(M/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>)≥slant 6]. Our model follows observed mass and luminosity functions of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and reproduces the redshift evolution of colors, sizes, star formation, and chemical properties of the observed galaxy population. Unlike other existing approaches, our model includes a self-consistent treatment of stellar and photoionized gas emission and dust attenuation based on the BEAGLE tool. The mock galaxy catalogs generated with our new model can be used to simulate and optimize extragalactic surveys with future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and to enable critical assessments of analysis procedures, interpretation tools, and measurement systematics for both photometric and spectroscopic data. As a first application of this work, we make predictions for the upcoming JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a joint program of the JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Guaranteed Time Observations teams. We show that JADES will detect, with NIRCam imaging, 1000s of galaxies at z ≳ 6, and 10s at z ≳ 10 at {m}<SUB>{AB</SUB>}≲ 30 (5σ) within the 236 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> of the survey. The JADES data will enable accurate constraints on the evolution of the UV luminosity function at z &gt; 8, and resolve the current debate about the rate of evolution of galaxies at z ≳ 8. Ready-to-use mock catalogs and software to generate new realizations are publicly available as the JAdes extraGalactic Ultradeep Artificial Realizations (JAGUAR) package., We report the detection of morphology-dependent stellar age in massive quenched galaxies (QGs) at z ∼ 1.2. The sense of the dependence is that compact QGs are 0.5-2 Gyr older than normal-sized ones. The evidence comes from three different age indicators—{D}<SUB>n</SUB>4000, {{{H}}}<SUB>δ </SUB>, and fits to spectral synthesis models—applied to their stacked optical spectra. All age indicators consistently show that the stellar populations of compact QGs are older than those of their normal-sized counterparts. We detect weak [O II] emission in a fraction of QGs, and the strength of the line, when present, is similar between the two samples; however, compact galaxies exhibit a significantly lower frequency of [O II] emission than normal ones. Fractions of both samples are individually detected in 7 Ms Chandra X-ray images (luminosities ∼10<SUP>40</SUP>-10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The 7 Ms stacks of nondetected galaxies show similarly low luminosities in the soft band only, consistent with a hot gas origin for the X-ray emission. While both [O II] emitters and nonemitters are also X-ray sources among normal galaxies, no compact galaxy with [O II] emission is an X-ray source, arguing against an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powering the line in compact galaxies. We interpret the [O II] properties as further evidence that compact galaxies are older and further along in the process of quenching star formation and suppressing gas accretion. Finally, we argue that the older age of compact QGs is evidence of progenitor bias: compact QGs simply reflect the smaller sizes of galaxies at their earlier quenching epoch, with stellar density most likely having nothing directly to do with cessation of star formation., Detailed petrologic, geochemical and isotopic analyses of a new FUN CAI from the Allende CV3 meteorite (designated CMS-1) indicate that it formed by extensive melting and evaporation of primitive precursor material(s). The precursor material(s) condensed in a <SUP>16</SUP>O-rich region (δ<SUP>17</SUP>O and δ<SUP>18</SUP>O ∼ -49‰) of the inner solar nebula dominated by gas of solar composition at total pressures of ∼10<SUP>-3</SUP>-10<SUP>-6</SUP> bar. Subsequent melting of the precursor material(s) was accompanied by evaporative loss of magnesium, silicon and oxygen resulting in large mass-dependent isotope fractionations in these elements (δ<SUP>25</SUP>Mg = 30.71-39.26‰, δ<SUP>29</SUP>Si = 14.98-16.65‰, and δ<SUP>18</SUP>O = -41.57 to -15.50‰). This evaporative loss resulted in a bulk composition similar to that of compact Type A and Type B CAIs, but very distinct from the composition of the original precursor condensate(s). Kinetic fractionation factors and the measured mass-dependent fractionation of silicon and magnesium in CMS-1 suggest that ∼80% of the silicon and ∼85% of the magnesium were lost from its precursor material(s) through evaporative processes. These results suggest that the precursor material(s) of normal and FUN CAIs condensed in similar environments, but subsequently evolved under vastly different conditions such as total gas pressure. The chemical and isotopic differences between normal and FUN CAIs could be explained by sorting of early solar system materials into distinct physical and chemical regimes, in conjunction with discrete heating events, within the protoplanetary disk., The noble gases play an important role in understanding Earth's accretion and subsequent evolution. Neon isotopes in particular have the potential to distinguish between distinct sources of Earth's volatiles e.g., acquisition of nebular gas, solar wind implanted materials or chondritic meteorites and their components. The neon isotopic composition of the deep mantle remains subject to debate with the majority of mantle-derived basalts displaying maximum 20Ne/22Ne ratios less than 12.5, similar to values determined for the convective mantle (20Ne/22Ne = 12.49 +/- 0.04; [1]). These values are also much lower than those of solar wind (20Ne/22Ne = 13.8; [2,3]) and estimates of the nebular gas (20Ne/22Ne = 13.4; [4]) but comparable to solar wind implanted meteoritic materials (20Ne/22Ne = 12.5-12.7; [5]). Here we determine the neon isotopic composition of mantle-derived materials from the south Atlantic. These samples display strong linear correlations in 20Ne/22Ne-21Ne/22Ne space with maximum 20Ne/22Ne ratios that are resolvable from and higher than materials derived from the convecting mantle as well as models of solar wind implantation. These results supplement a growing database of mantle materials characterized by 20Ne/22Ne ratios greater than 12.5, challenging the notion that the entire mantle acquired volatiles from solar wind implanted meteoritic materials. In this presentation we will explore alternative origins for these volatiles and provide testable predictions for each scenario. [1] G. Holland, C.J. Ballentine.. Nature 441 (2006), 186-191. [2] A.

We present rest-frame UV spectra of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3 selected to be candidate progenitors of the quenched galaxies at z ~ 2 based on their compact rest-frame-optical sizes and high Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>. We compare their UV properties to those of more extended LBGs of similar mass and star-formation rate (non-candidates). We find that candidate progenitors have faster bulk interstellar medium (ISM) gas velocities and higher equivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocity spread among absorbing clouds. Candidates deviate from the relationship between equivalent widths of Lyα and interstellar absorption lines in that their Lyα emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption, possibly indicating that the neutral H I fraction is patchy, such that Lyα photons can escape. We detect stronger C IV P-Cygni features (emission and absorption) and He II emission in candidates, indicative of larger populations of metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars compared to non-candidates. The faster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and Lyα properties of candidates are consistent with their ISM being subject to more energetic feedback than non-candidates. Together with their larger metallicity (implying more evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, if speculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates, supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them as progenitors of z ~ 2 passive galaxies. We propose that massive, compact galaxies undergo more rapid growth of their stellar mass content, perhaps because the gas accretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally sized LBGs at these (early) epochs., In situ Mg-isotopic data for CMS-1 are reported along with a new set of vacuum experiments that were performed on its estimated precursor composition., The first galaxies in the universe (e.g. z&gt;2) to quench their star-formation appear to be both the most massive, and also the most compact (in stellar density). The nature of quenching mechanisms are poorly understood at any epoch, however the ubiquity of these quenched compact galaxies at high-redshift implies that quenching at this epoch, during the peak of star-formation activity in the universe, preferentially affects compact galaxies. We have selected a sample of their star-forming progenitors among Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3 based on the hypothesis that any candidate progenitors must also be compact, since merging and accretion tend to increase the sizes of galaxies. We present results based on analysis of both the spectral energy distributions and available spectroscopy for these compact star-forming progenitors compared to ordinary (in size) LBGs of similar masses. We find that these compact progenitors have redder rest-frame ultra-violet colors than ordinary LBGs, but with similar optical colors, consistent with an older burst of star-formation. Using rest-frame ultra-violet spectroscopy, we also find the compact progenitors have higher metallicities and/or more powerful winds than ordinary LBGs. These results are consistent with the idea that these compact galaxies evolve faster and quench earlier in cosmic time than more ordinary LBGs of similar mass. Ongoing analysis of these winds in compact galaxies, including additional spectroscopy, will provide crucial insight into the physics of quenching in galaxies., , We use GOODS and CANDELS images to identify progenitors of massive (M &gt; 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) compact early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z ~ 1.6. Because merging and accretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if the progenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compact themselves. We select candidate progenitors among compact Lyman-break galaxies at z ~ 3 on the basis of their mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and central stellar density, and we find that these account for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact ETGs at z ~ 1.6. We find that the average far-UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of the candidates is redder than that of the non-candidates, but the optical and mid-IR SED are the same, implying that the redder UV of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration and consistent with more evolved (aging) star formation. This is in line with other evidence suggesting that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity among high-redshift massive galaxies. We also find that the light distribution of both the compact ETGs and their candidate progenitors does not show any extended ""halos"" surrounding the compact ""core,""both in individual images and in stacks. We argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology of merger remnants, even if gas rich, as predicted by N-body simulations. This suggests that the compact ETGs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseous accretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected in the Hubble Space Telescope images, with their stellar mass assembling in situ, and that they have not experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z ~ 1.6., We report rare earth element abundances in the primary phases of Allende FUN CAI CMS-1. Implications are presented for the condensation of CMS-1 precursor material as well as fO2 conditions during subsequent melting of this material., We present measurements of microwave emission from an electron-beam induced air plasma performed at the 3 MeV electron Van de Graaff facility of the Argonne National Laboratory. Results include the emission spectrum between 1 and 15 GHz, the polarization of the microwave radiation and the scaling of the emitted power with respect to beam intensity. MAYBE measurements provide further insight on microwave emission from extensive air showers as a novel detection technique for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays., Recently, we reported on the Ti-, Si-, and Mg-isotopic compositions of a new FUN CAI, CMS-1. Here, we report on the O-isotopic composition of its primary phases., FUN CAIs preserve large isotopic anomalies in several neutron-rich isotopes including 50Ti, as well as extreme mass-dependent fractionations in Mg and Si. We report on the Ti, Si and Mg isotopic compositions of a new Allende FUN CAI designated CMS-1., High-redshift galaxy surveys have revealed a population of very massive and already evolved early-type galaxies at z &gt; 1, which appear to be ultra-compact in size relative to local galaxies of similar stellar mass. The compactness and stellar masses of these galaxies, which are already in place at high-redshift, pose challenges for theories in which mergers drive the evolution of galaxies. We investigate the properties of Lyman Break Galaxies at z &gt; 3 in CANDELS, among whom must be the progenitor population of these ultra-compact early-type galaxies, to assess the extent to which they were also ultra-compact while building up their stellar mass. Since merging and accretion generally increase the size of galaxies, the progenitors of the ultra-compact ellipticals must be compact star-forming galaxies themselves. Using rest-frame optical imaging from HST and SED fitting, we study the evolution in the mass-radius relation using their morphologies and stellar masses. We also discuss the implications that these ultra-compact star-forming galaxies have on theories of galaxy evolution and the quenching of star-formation at high-redshift., We report on the in situ measurement of titanium isotope ratios by LA-MC-ICPMS in nine Allende CAIs. Matrix-matched glass standards were synthesized and used for the correction of matrix-effects and isobaric interferences., , We measure the angular two-point correlation function of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) from 1.1 mm imaging of the COSMOS field with the AzTEC camera and ASTE 10 m telescope.

Key open questions remain about its 3-D structure, star formation properties, and role in regulating this gas inflow. In this work, we identify a hierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density maps from Paper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$), $T_{\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments) properties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). We compare these properties with regions in the Milky Way disk and external galaxies. Despite the fact that the CMZ overall is well below the Gao-Solomon dense gas star-formation relation (and in modest agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), individual structures on the scale of molecular clouds generally follow these star-formation relations and agree well with other Milky Way and extragalactic regions. We find that individual CMZ structures require a large external pressure ($P_e$/k$_B$ $&gt; 10^{7-9}$ K cm$^{-3}$) to be considered bound, however simple estimates suggest that most CMZ molecular-cloud-sized structures are consistent with being in pressure-bounded virial equilibriuim. We perform power-law fits to the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) of the inner 100 pc, SgrB2, and the outer 100 pc of the CMZ as well as several individual molecular cloud structures and find generally steeper power-law slopes ($-9&lt;\alpha&lt;-2$) compared with the literature ($-6 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1$)., The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40°($|l| &lt;$ 20°) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $&gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40°($|l| &lt;$ 20°) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8°$&gt; \ell &gt;$ -1.3°. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT., We combine the rich legacy of NASA space astrophysics mission data from Chandra, Herschel, and Spitzer in a novel way that exploits natural X-ray tomography to produce 3D maps of molecular clouds (MCs, the birthplaces of stars) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy for the first time. While standard observations are limited to a 2-D view (plus one dimension of velocity for spectral line data), numerical simulations reveal that MCs have rich and complex 3-D structures, which cannot be accurately represented by 2-D projections. Our new maps enable the first 3-D measurements of the physical properties of MCs (including measures of their internal turbulence), which are topics of particularly intense interest and heated debate in our extreme CMZ. <P />This pioneering modeling of MCs in 3-D is now possible thanks to decades of Chandra Xray observations, which can be combined and compared with archival Herschel and Spitzer data. Past X-ray events from SgrA* propagate radially outwards and produce X-ray echoes when the light interacts with the surrounding molecular gas. Different epoch Chandra observations slice through the 3-D structure of the MCs along the light s path, illuminating different parts of the cloud over time, akin to X-ray tomography in medical science. We combine these multi-epoch Chandra X-ray data with archival Herschel Far-IR and Spitzer Mid-IR data, complemented by ground-based radio spectral line data, to map the MCs in 3-D for the first time. Using these unprecedented maps, we measure the physical and turbulent properties of MCs in the CMZ. Additionally, since the observed X-ray echoes are a convolution of SgrA* s past light curve and the properties of the reflecting clouds, the proposed study will provide key constraints on the previous flaring activity of SgrA*. <P />We benchmark the success of our program by the accomplishment of three key goals: 1) Goal I: Generate 3-D maps of MCs in the CMZ. By combining the Chandra time lags with identified cloud structures in Herschel and Spitzer, we will model the 3-D distribution of each MC. Goal II: Measure the turbulent and physical properties of MCs in 3-D. Using these novel 3-D maps of each MC, we will measure and report on their physical (size, axis ratio, and orientation) and turbulent properties (using the Spatial Power Spectrum and Density Probability Distribution Function) in 3-D. Goal III: Constrain previous SgrA* flaring activity. By correlating the X-ray echoes with our measurements of the 3-D cloud structure and distribution, we will constrain the outburst history of SgrA*. <P />The proposed study capitalizes on the complementary strengths of three NASA space astro- physics missions in a novel way to directly address the fundamental nature of MCs in 3-D and to help constrain the past outbursts from our Galaxy s central supermassive black hole, SgrA*., We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ∼3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos., The Origins Space Telescope, one of four large Mission Concept studies sponsored by NASA for review in the 2020 US Astrophysics Decadal Survey, will open unprecedented discovery space in the infrared, unveiling our cosmic origins. About half of the light emitted by stars, planets, and galaxies over the lifetime of the Universe emerges in the infrared. With an unparalleled sensitivity increase of up to a factor of 1,000 more than any previous or planned mission, the jump forward offered by the Origins Space Telescope is akin to that from the naked eye to humanity's first telescope. The Origins mission concept is by and for the community and is designed to answer the biggest questions of today and with the flexibility to explore the discoveries of tomorrow. Origins is a non-deployed 5.9m telescope operating in the mid- to far-IR (with continuous coverage from 2.8 - 588 micron) that is cooled to 4.5 K. The Origins mission concept encompasses four key areas: 1) it will address whether we are alone in the Universe by searching for signs of life in the atmospheres of potentially habitable terrestrial planets transiting M dwarf stars. 2) To understand how planets become habitable Origins will trace the trail of cold water from the interstellar medium, through protoplanetary disks, and into the outer reaches of our own Solar System. 3) With its broad wavelength coverage and fast mapping speeds, Origins will map millions of galaxies, simultaneously measuring star formation rates and black hole growth across cosmic time uncovering how stars, galaxies, black holes, and the elements of life form, from cosmic dawn to today. 4) Finally, perhaps the greatest promise of Origins though is its unprecedented discovery space, opening up a new infrared window into the cosmos., The inner few hundred parsecs of our Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), has a star formation rate that is about a factor of ten lower than expected given its high proportion of dense gas. We present the fraction of dense gas across this region, measured using the SMA Legacy Survey, CMZoom. We find that much of the dense gas has not yet collapsed into compact, high-mass cores. We zoom into the compact, high-mass cores that have formed and compare them directly with cores in the Galactic disk, finding some similarities. The low fraction of compact, high-mass cores is likely connected to the overall lower than expected star formation rate in the CMZ, however, the root cause is still an area of active investigation., The Origins Space Telescope (OST) is the Mission Concept for the Far-Infrared Surveyor, one of the four science and technology definition studies of NASA Headquarters for the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal survey. Origins will enable flagship-quality general observing programs led by the astronomical community in the 2030s. This presentation will summarize the science case related to Nearby Galaxies, the Milky Way, and the Interstellar Medium (Interstellar Medium). The Origins Space Telescope will enable a wealth of unprecedented scientific advances in this area, both those we know to expect, and the discovery space that lies unexplored. Origins will enable a comprehensive view of magnetic fields, turbulence, and the multiphase ISM; connecting these physics across scales of galaxies to protostellar cores. With unprecedented sensitivity, Origins will measure and characterize the mechanisms of feedback from star formation and Active Galactic Nuclei, and their interplay, over cosmic time. Origins will unveil the abundance and availability of water for habitable planets by allowing us to trace the trail of water from interstellar clouds to protoplanetary disks, to Earth itself., The Origins Space Telescope, one of four large Mission Concept Studies sponsored by NASA for review in the 2020 US Astrophysics Decadal Survey, will open unprecedented discovery space in the infrared, unveiling our cosmic origins., The Origins Space Telescope (OST) is the mission concept for the Far-Infrared Surveyor, one of the four science and technology definition studies of NASA Headquarters for the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal survey.

We present an update on the first large-area survey to expose the sites of star formation across the CMZ at high-resolution in submillimeter wavelengths: the CMZoom survey with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We identify the locations of dense cores and search for signatures of embedded star formation. CMZoom is a three-year survey, completed this year, and has mapped out the highest column density regions of the CMZ in dust continuum and a variety of spectral lines around 1.3 mm. CMZoom combines SMA compact and subcompact configurations with single-dish data from BGPS and the APEX telescope, achieving an angular resolution of about 4” (0.2 pc) and good image fidelity up to large spatial scales., High-mass stars form within star clusters from dense, molecular regions (DMRs), but is the process of cluster formation slow and hydrostatic or quick and dynamic? We link the physical properties of high-mass star-forming regions with their evolutionary stage in a systematic way, using Herschel and Spitzer data. In order to produce a robust estimate of the relative lifetimes of these regions, we compare the fraction of DMRs above a column density associated with high-mass star formation, N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 0.4-2.5 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, in the “starless” (no signature of stars ≳10 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> forming) and star-forming phases in a 2° × 2° region of the Galactic Plane centered at ℓ = 30°. Of regions capable of forming high-mass stars on ∼1 pc scales, the starless (or embedded beyond detection) phase occupies about 60%-70% of the DMR lifetime, and the star-forming phase occupies about 30%-40%. These relative lifetimes are robust over a wide range of thresholds. We outline a method by which relative lifetimes can be anchored to absolute lifetimes from large-scale surveys of methanol masers and UCHII regions. A simplistic application of this method estimates the absolute lifetime of the starless phase to be 0.2-1.7 Myr (about 0.6-4.1 fiducial cloud free-fall times) and the star-forming phase to be 0.1-0.7 Myr (about 0.4-2.4 free-fall times), but these are highly uncertain. This work uniquely investigates the star-forming nature of high column density gas pixel by pixel, and our results demonstrate that the majority of high column density gas is in a starless or embedded phase., The Origins Space Telescope (OST) is the mission concept for the Far-Infrared Surveyor, a study in development by NASA in preparation for the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. Origins is planned to be a large aperture, actively-cooled telescope covering a wide span of the mid- to far-infrared spectrum. Its imagers and spectrographs will enable a variety of surveys of the sky that will discover and characterize the most distant galaxies, Milky-Way, exoplanets, and the outer reaches of our Solar system. Origins will enable flagship-quality general observing programs led by the astronomical community in the 2030s.

The team can be contacted at firsurveyor_info@lists.ipac.caltech.edu.This presentation will provide a summary of the science case related to the Interstellar Medium (ISM), the Milky Way, and Nearby Galaxies. Origins will enable a comprehensive view of magnetic fields, turbulence, and the multi-phase ISM; connecting physics at all scales, from galaxies to protostellar cores. With unprecedented sensitivity, Origins will measure and characterize the mechanisms of feedback from star formation and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) over cosmic time and trace the trail of water from interstellar clouds, to protoplanetary disks, to Earth itself in order to understand the abundance and availability of water for habitable planets., The inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), is our closest laboratory for understanding star formation in the extreme environments (hot, dense, turbulent gas) that once dominated the universe. We present an update on the first large-area survey to expose the sites of star formation across the CMZ at high-resolution in submillimeter wavelengths: the CMZoom survey with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We identify the locations of dense cores and search for signatures of embedded star formation. CMZoom is a three-year survey in its final year and is mapping out the highest column density regions of the CMZ in dust continuum and a variety of spectral lines around 1.3 mm. CMZoom combines SMA compact and subcompact configurations with single-dish data from BGPS and the APEX telescope, achieving an angular resolution of about 4'' (0.2 pc) and good image fidelity up to large spatial scales., The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is home to the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in our Galaxy. Analogous to high-redshift galaxies in its gas density and level of turbulence, the CMZ, at a distance of only 8.4 kpc, is our nearest laboratory to understand extreme star formation throughout the universe. We exploit the high angular resolution, large bandwidth, and wide-field mapping capabilities of the Submilllimeter Array (SMA) to conduct the first large-scale, high-resolution survey of this uniquely interesting star-forming environment in the Milky Way. Over the course of 3 years, we are mapping 240 sq. arcminutes of the highest column density gas in the CMZ at 0.2 pc resolution in both 1.3 mm cold dust continuum and a variety of spectral lines (including tracers of dense gas, hot core chemistry, shocks, and outflows). We present here early highlights of the survey from years 1 and 2, including evidence for tidal compression of clouds at pericenter passage by Sgr A* and the consequent formation of massive clusters. We observe widespread shocks, high densities, and high turbulence in clouds at percienter passage, but no active star formation, while clouds further downstream show progressively more evolved star formation., Many students graduate high school having never learned about the process and people behind modern science research. The BiteScis program addresses this gap by providing easily implemented lesson plans that incorporate the whos, whats, and hows of today's scienctific discoveries. We bring together practicing scientists (motivated graduate students from the selective communicating science conference, ComSciCon) with K-12 science teachers to produce, review, and disseminate K-12 lesson plans based on modern science research. These lesson plans vary in topic from environmental science to neurobiology to astrophysics, and involve a range of activities from laboratory exercises to art projects, debates, or group discussion. An integral component of the program is a series of short, ""bite-size"" articles on modern science research written for K-12 students. The ""bite-size"" articles and lesson plans will be made freely available online in an easily searchable web interface that includes association with a variety of curriculum standards. This ongoing program is in its first year with about 15 lesson plans produced to date., The newly discovered Massive Molecular Filament (MMF) G32.02+0.05 (~ 70 pc long, 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) has been shaped and compressed by older generations of massive stars. The similarity of this filament in physical structure (density profile, temperature) to much smaller star-forming filaments, suggests that the mechanism to form such filaments may be a universal process. The densest portion of the filament, apparent as an Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) shows a range of massive star formation signatures throughout. We investigate the kinematics in this filament and find widespread inverse P cygni asymmetric line profiles. These line asymmetries are interpreted as a signature of large-scale radial collapse. Using line asymmetries observed with optically thick HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (1-0) and optically thin H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> (1-0) across a range of massive star forming regions in the filament, we estimate the global radial infall rate of the filament to range from a few 100 to a few 1000 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> Myr<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. At its current infall rate the densest portions of the cloud will more than double their current mass within a Myr., I present preliminary results from the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) ongoing legacy survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, central 500 pc) of our Galaxy. Analogous to some high-redshift galaxies in global properties (kinematics, baryonic composition, and density), the CMZ provides our nearest laboratory to understand extreme star formation throughout the universe. The CMZ comprises the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Milky Way, yet its star formation rate is about an order of magnitude lower than expected given current star formation theories. To understand this paucity of star formation, we exploit the SMA's unique combination of large primary beam, high angular resolution, and large instantaneous bandwidth to map the dense gas and dust in the CMZ at sub-pc scales for the first time. Over the course of 2 years, we will map 240 sq. arcminutes of the highest column density structure in the CMZ at 0.1 pc resolution at 230 GHz, tracing both dust and a multitude of molecular transitions including CO isotopologues and tracers of dense gas, hot cores, and shocks/outflows. We will identify the location of dense pre-stellar cores in the CMZ, characterize their physical properties, and search for embedded signatures of star formation. These measurements allow us to address fundamental questions regarding the nature of star formation in extreme environments as well as the current state and potential episodicity of star formation in the CMZ. I will present preliminary results from year 1 of the survey, with a focus on comparing the star forming activity and turbulent properties (inferred from column density PDFs) of clouds in different CMZ environments., The newly discovered massive molecular filament G32.02+0.05 (~70 pc long, 10^5 Msun) has been shaped and compressed by older generations of massive stars. The similarity of this filament in physical structure (density profile, temperature) to much smaller star-forming filaments, suggests that the mechanism to form such filaments is a universal process. The densest portion of the filament, apparent as an Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) appears to have been compressed on both sides by a pair of bubbles and now shows a range of massive star formation signatures throughout. We investigate the kinematics in this massive star-forming filament and find velocity coherence along the filament and global blue asymmetric line profiles. These line asymmetries are interpreted as a signature of large-scale radial collapse. Using line asymmetries observed with optically thick HCO+ (1-0) and optically thin H13CO+ (1-0) across a range of massive star forming regions in the filament, we estimate the global radial infall rate of the filament to range from a few 100 to a few 1000 Msun/Myr/pc^2. At its current infall rate the densest portions of the cloud will more than double their current mass within a Myr. The discovery of such a reservoir of infalling gas has important ramifications on the course of star formation in the cloud and on our overall understanding of star cluster formation., Upon first entering university, the fraction of students interested in pursuing a STEM major are distributed according to societal demographics (with 25% being underrepresented minorities), but by graduation, the fraction of students receiving STEM degrees is unbalanced, with underrepresented minorities receiving only 15% of STEM bachelor's degrees. The CU-STARs (CU Science, Technology, and Astronomy Recruits) program at the University of Colorado, Boulder is targeted to address the main triggers of early career attrition for underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines. A select group of students are given financial support through work-study at the Fiske planetarium on campus, while resources to address other triggers of attrition are available to the entire cohort of interested students (typically ~5-10 per year). These resources are designed to promote social engagement and mentorship, while also providing a support network and resources to combat inadequate high school preparation for STEM courses. We achieve these goals through activities that include social events, mentor meetings, free tutoring, and special events to meet and talk with scientists. The culmination of the program for the recruits are a series of high school outreach events in underserved areas (inner city and rural alike), in which they become the expert. The STARs are paid for their time and take the lead in planning, teaching, and facilitating programs for the high school students, including classroom presentations, interactive lab activities, solar observing, and star parties. The high school outreach events provide role models and STEM exposure for the underserved high school community while simultaneously cementing the personal achievements and successes for the STARs. CU-STARs is now in its 4th year and is still growing. We are beginning the process of formal assessments of the program's success. We present details of the program implementation, a discussion of potential obstacles and future plans, and initial results of the program assessment, which speak highly of the program's contribution to individual student success., We present preliminary results from the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) ongoing legacy survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, central 500 pc) of our Galaxy. Analogous to high-redshift galaxies in global properties (kinematics, baryonic composition, and density), the CMZ provides our nearest laboratory to understand extreme star formation throughout the universe. The CMZ comprises the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Milky Way, yet its star formation rate is about an order of magnitude lower than expected given current star formation theories. To understand this paucity of star formation, we exploit the SMA's unique combination of large primary beam, high angular resolution, and large instantaneous bandwidth to map the dense gas and dust in the CMZ at sub-pc scales for the first time. Over the course of 2-3 years, we plan to map 240 sq. arcminutes of the highest column density structure in the CMZ at 0.1 pc resolution at 230 GHz, tracing both dust (to a point source sensitivity of ~10 solar masses) and a multitude of molecular transitions including CO isotopologues and tracers of dense gas, hot cores, and shocks/outflows. We expect to measure (i) a complete census of the most massive and dense cloud cores, (ii) the location and strength of strong shocks, (iii) core temperatures and turbulent line widths, and (iv) the relationship of star formation, dense gas fraction, and turbulent line width to environmental conditions in regions throughout the CMZ. These measurements allow us to address fundamental questions regarding the nature of star formation in extreme environments. Here we present results from year 1 of the survey, focusing on tracing the locations, star-forming signatures, and properties of dense cores as a function of environment in the CMZ., We present new NH<SUB>3</SUB> (1, 1), (2, 2), and (4, 4) observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array compiled with work in the literature to explore the range of conditions observed in young, massive star-forming regions. To sample the effects of evolution independent from those of distance/resolution, abundance, and large-scale environment, we compare clumps in different evolutionary stages within a single infrared dark cloud (IRDC), G32.02+0.06. We find that the early stages of clustered star formation are characterized by dense, parsec-scale filamentary structures interspersed with complexes of dense cores (&lt;0.1 pc cores clustered in complexes separated by ~1 pc) with masses from about 10 to 100 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The most quiescent core is the most extended while the star forming cores are denser and more compact, showing very similar column density structure before and shortly after the onset of massive star formation, with peak surface densities Σ &gt;~ 1 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Quiescent cores and filaments show smoothly varying temperatures from 10 to 20 K, rising to over 40 K in star-forming cores. We calculate virial parameters for 16 cores and find that the level of support provided by turbulence is generally insufficient to support them against gravitational collapse (langα<SUB>vir</SUB>rang ~ 0.6). The star-forming filaments show smooth velocity fields, punctuated by discontinuities at the sites of active star formation. We discuss the massive molecular filament (M ~ 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, length &gt;60 pc) hosting the IRDC, hypothesizing that it may have been shaped by previous generations of massive stars., We explore the relationship between gas and dust in a massive star-forming region by comparing the physical properties derived from each. We compare the temperatures and column densities in a massive star-forming Infrared Dark Cloud (G32.02+0.05), which shows a range of evolutionary states, from quiescent to active. The gas properties were derived using radiative transfer modeling of the (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4) transitions of NH<SUB>3</SUB> on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, while the dust temperatures and column densities were calculated using cirrus-subtracted, modified blackbody fits to Herschel data. We compare the derived column densities to calculate an NH<SUB>3</SUB> abundance, χ_{NH_{3}} = 4.6 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP>. In the coldest star-forming region, we find that the measured dust temperatures are lower than the measured gas temperatures (mean and standard deviations T <SUB>dust, avg</SUB> ~ 11.6 ± 0.2 K versus T <SUB>gas, avg</SUB> ~ 15.2 ± 1.5 K), which may indicate that the gas and dust are not well-coupled in the youngest regions (~0.5 Myr) or that these observations probe a regime where the dust and/or gas temperature measurements are unreliable. Finally, we calculate millimeter fluxes based on the temperatures and column densities derived from NH<SUB>3</SUB>, which suggest that millimeter dust continuum observations of massive star-forming regions, such as the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey or ATLASGAL, can probe hot cores, cold cores, and the dense gas lanes from which they form, and are generally not dominated by the hottest core., The ubiquity of filaments in star forming regions on a range of scales is clear, yet their role in the star formation process remains in question. We suggest that there are distinct classes of filaments which are responsible for their observed diversity in star-forming regions. An example of a massive molecular filament in the Galactic mid-plane formed at the intersection of UV-driven bubbles which displays a coherent velocity structure (&lt; 4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) over 80 pc is presented.

TIME-Pilot will also probe the molecular gas content of the universe during the epoch spanning the peak of star formation (z ~ 1 -3) by making an intensity mapping measurement of the CO transitions in the TIME-Pilot band (CO(3-2), CO(4-3), CO(5-4), and CO(6-5)). I will describe the instrument we are building which is an R of ~100 spectrometer sensitive to the 200-300 GHz radiation. The camera is designed to measure the line emission from galaxies using an intensity mapping technique. This instrument will allow us to detect the [CII] clustering fluctuations from faint galaxies during EoR and compare these measurements to predicted [CII] amplitudes from current models. The CO measurements will allow us to constrain models for galaxies at lower redshift. The [CII] intensity mapping measurements that will be made with TIME-Pilot and detailed measurements made with future more sensitive mm-wavelength spectrometers are complimentary to 21-cm measurements of the EoR and complimentary to direct detections of high redshift galaxies with HST, ALMA, and, in the future, JWST., We present measurements of E-mode polarization and temperature-E-mode correlation in the cosmic microwave background using data from the first season of observations with SPTpol, the polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The observations used in this work cover 100 {{deg }<SUP>2</SUP>} of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 GHz. We report the E-mode angular auto-power spectrum (EE) and the temperature-E-mode angular cross-power spectrum (TE) over the multipole range 500 &lt; ℓ ≤ 5000. These power spectra improve on previous measurements in the high-ℓ (small-scale) regime. We fit the combination of the SPTpol power spectra, data from Planck, and previous SPT measurements with a six-parameter ΛCDM cosmological model. We find that the best-fit parameters are consistent with previous results. The improvement in high-ℓ sensitivity over previous measurements leads to a significant improvement in the limit on polarized point-source power: after masking sources brighter than 50 mJy in unpolarized flux at 150 GHz, we find a 95% confidence upper limit on unclustered point-source power in the EE spectrum of {{D}<SUB>\ell </SUB>}=\ell (\ell +1){{C}<SUB>\ell </SUB>}/2π \lt 0.40 μ {{K}<SUP>2</SUP>} at \ell =3000, indicating that future EE measurements will not be limited by power from unclustered point sources in the multipole range \ell \lt 3600, and possibly much higher in \ell ., SPTpol is a polarization-sensitive camera designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) deployed on the 10 meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) in January 2012. I will present our recent results from the 100 square degree survey (the first year of data) focusing on the recently published high signal-to-noise measurement of the E-mode and temperature-E-mode correlation CMB power spectra. Additionally I will show B-mode power spectra, measurements of the gravitational lensing potential, and briefly report on the status of SPTpol results from the full 500 square degree survey., TIME-Pilot is designed to make measurements from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the first stars and galaxies formed and ionized the intergalactic medium. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). In particular, TIME-Pilot will produce the first detection of [CII] clustering fluctuations, a signal proportional to the integrated [CII] intensity, summed over all EoR galaxies. TIME-Pilot is thus sensitive to the emission from dwarf galaxies, thought to be responsible for the balance of ionizing UV photons, that will be difficult to detect individually with JWST and ALMA. A detection of [CII] clustering fluctuations would validate current theoretical estimates of the [CII] line as a new cosmological observable, opening the door for a new generation of instruments with advanced technology spectroscopic array focal planes that will map [CII] fluctuations to probe the EoR history of star formation, bubble size, and ionization state. Additionally, TIME-Pilot will produce high signal-to-noise measurements of CO clustering fluctuations, which trace the role of molecular gas in star-forming galaxies at redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 2. With its unique atmospheric noise mitigation, TIME-Pilot also significantly improves sensitivity for measuring the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in galaxy clusters. TIME-Pilot will employ a linear array of spectrometers, each consisting of a parallel-plate diffraction grating. The spectrometer bandwidth covers 185-323 GHz to both probe the entire redshift range of interest and to include channels at the edges of the band for atmospheric noise mitigation. We illuminate the telescope with f/3 horns, which balances the desire to both couple to the sky with the best efficiency per beam, and to pack a large number of horns into the fixed field of view. Feedhorns couple radiation to the waveguide spectrometer gratings. Each spectrometer grating has 190 facets and provides resolving power above 100. At this resolution, the longest dimension of the grating is 31 cm, which allows us to stack gratings in two blocks (one for each polarization) of 16 within a single cryostat, providing a 1x16 array of beams in a 14 arcminute field of view. Direct absorber TES sensors sit at the output of the grating on six linear facets over the output arc, allowing us to package and read out the detectors as arrays in a modular manner. The 1840 detectors will be read out with the NIST time-domain-multiplexing (TDM) scheme and cooled to a base temperature of 250 mK with a 3He sorption refrigerator. We present preliminary designs for the TIME-Pilot cryogenics, spectrometers, bolometers, and optics., We present maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization at 90 and 150 GHz measured with SPTpol and the first EE and TE CMB power spectrum measurements from SPTpol. We also describe the SPTpol instrument in detail. We discuss the development of the SPTpol camera including the cryogenic design and the transition edge sensor (TES) detectors developed at NIST and Argonne National Laboratory. The goals of the SPTpol project are to exploit the high resolution of the telescope (1 arcminute beam) and the high sensitivity afforded by the 1536 detector camera to measure the E-mode power spectrum of the CMB, characterize the B-mode polarization induced by the gravitational lensing of the primordial E-mode CMB polarization, and to detector set an upper limit on the level of the B-mode polarization from inflationary gravitational waves. This thesis is a first step toward accomplishing these goals. Measuring the E-mode power spectrum will allow us to improve constraints on parameters of the current cosmological models that are sensitive to the damping tail of the CMB., A new polarization-sensitive camera, SPT-POL, designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), was deployed on the 10 meter South Pole Telescope in January 2012. The goal of the project is to exploit the high resolution of the telescope (1 arcminute beam) and the high sensitivity afforded by the 1536 detector camera to characterize the B-mode polarization induced by the gravitational lensing of the primordial E-mode CMB polarization, as well as to detect or set an upper limit on the level of the B-mode polarization from inflationary gravitational waves. The lensing B-modes will be used to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses by measuring large scale structure, while the inflationary B-modes are sensitive to the energy scale of inflation. I will discuss the development of the SPT-POL camera including the cryogenic design and the transition edge sensor (TES) detectors as well as the science goals and status of the ongoing of the SPT-POL program., We present optical data on prototype polarization sensitive Argonne/KICP detectors fabricated at Argonne National Labs which are designed to be installed on the South Pole Telescope and used to measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. The detectors are Mo/Au transition edge sensors (TES) suspended on silicon nitride, with radiation coupled to the TES using a gold bar absorber. Two stacked detectors with bars in orthogonal directions will be used to measure both polarizations. We discuss measurements of the optical bandpass, time constants and cross-polarization of the detectors.","['2017AAS...22912501C', '10.48550/arXiv.1411.1042', 'arXiv:1411.1042', '2014arXiv1411.1042C', '10.1088/0004-637X/805/1/36', '2015ApJ...805...36C', '2015APS..APR.X2004C', '10.1117/12.2057207', '2014SPIE.9153E..1WC', '2013PhDT.......327C', '2013AAS...22110505C', '2009AIPC.1185..203C', '10.1063/1.3292315']","[('measurement', 18), ('polarization', 18), ('mode', 17), ('time', 13), ('power', 13), ('pilot', 11), ('detector', 11), ('cii', 10), ('spectrum', 10), ('sensitive', 9)]","[(('time', 'pilot'), 11), (('power', 'spectrum'), 9), (('mode', 'polarization'), 5), (('cosmic', 'microwave'), 5), (('microwave', 'background'), 5), (('intensity', 'mapping'), 4), (('clustering', 'fluctuation'), 4), (('polarization', 'sensitive'), 4), (('south', 'pole'), 4), (('pole', 'telescope'), 4)]","[(('cosmic', 'microwave', 'background'), 5), (('south', 'pole', 'telescope'), 4), (('cii', 'clustering', 'fluctuations'), 3), (('ell', 'ell', 'ell'), 3), (('measure', 'polarization', 'cosmic'), 3), (('polarization', 'cosmic', 'microwave'), 3), (('microwave', 'background', 'cmb'), 3), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'eor'), 2), (('camera', 'designed', 'measure'), 2), (('temperature', 'mode', 'correlation'), 2)]",Dirty

Berkeley, UC Berkeley and National Radio Astronomy Observatory","Theia 520 is a stellar structure recently discovered with Gaia DR2 astrometry. Stellar rotation periods measured from Kepler, TESS, and ZTF show Theia 520 to be ~400 Myr old. According to the Kounkel &amp; Covey (2019) membership, it is home to Kepler-52 and -968, each of which hosts three small transiting planets. These exoplanets could then become important touchstones for studying the evolution of exoplanet properties in the first billion years. However, Zucker et al. (2022) cast doubt on the reality of the Theia structures as truly coeval clusters, including Theia 520, primarily due to their apparently high velocity dispersions. Furthermore, Hunt et al. (2023) performed a new search for stellar structures within Gaia DR3 using the same HDBSCAN clustering algorithm employed by Kounkel &amp; Covey, and while they did recover Theia 520, the exoplanet hosts were not listed among its members. Here, we report results from a large spectroscopic survey of ~100 candidate members using OHP SOPHIE, CFHT ESPaDOnS, and Gemini-N GRACES. First, we use the high-precision radial velocities to inform a new search for comoving stars in Gaia DR3 using the FriendFinder algorithm. Next, we measure stellar parameters by jointly analyzing the optical spectra and broadband photometry to better constrain the bulk properties of the cluster. Finally, we comment on the reality of Theia 520 as a coeval stellar cluster and the membership of Kepler-52 and -968., It was recently claimed that the Sun's photometric variability is abnormally low relative to analogous stars observed by NASA's Kepler space telescope to rotate every 20-30 days. The implication is that the Sun's various manifestations of magnetic activity could likewise exhibit much higher excursions in the future or recent past. However, this conclusion was reached erroneously due to an invalid sample of solar analogs stemming from the use of photometric temperatures that are biased to warmer values by 200-300 K, rather than an abnormally inactive Sun. We demonstrate that the cause of this severe bias is not an inaccuracy in either the photometric or spectroscopic temperature scales, but rather a systematic overestimate of the interstellar reddening across and through the Kepler field. The result is that the sample is actually composed of stars that are significantly cooler and younger than the Sun. Since magnetic activity tightly correlates with Rossby number, such stars are naturally more active while spinning near the solar rate due to their deeper convective zones, longer turnover timescales, and therefore smaller Rossby numbers. Compiling a list of true solar analogs observed by Kepler is challenging because their rotation periods are difficult to measure in broadband light. However, we show that the limited sample that can be curated presents photometric variability from Kepler and chromospheric Ca II H&amp;K emission levels from LAMOST on par with the Sun's present-day range. After weighing other results from stellar astrophysics, we conclude that the Sun's magnetic activity overall appears normal for its age., Thousands of planets have been discovered via transits detected by NASA's Kepler/K2 and TESS missions. These same light curves can be used to measure rotation periods for the planet-hosting stars. Since low-mass stars spin down over time via magnetic braking, it has become popular to infer ages for these planet hosts using gyrochronology models available in the literature. However, recent surveys of rotation in older open clusters (e.g., NGC 6811, NGC 752, Ruprecht 147) reveal that stars temporarily stop spinning down, and that the duration of this pause increases toward lower stellar masses. Ignoring this phenomenon, as most models do, can lead to huge age biases accompanied by severely overestimated precisions. We introduce an empirical, cluster-based procedure for age-dating low-mass K dwarfs. We also explain some limitations to gyrochronology stemming from a lack of very low-mass stars with periods in old clusters, as well as an intrinsic increase in age uncertainty that arises during the temporary pause., Recent measurements of rotation periods in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (700 Myr), NGC 6811 (1.0 Gyr), NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr), and Ruprecht 147 (2.7 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass-period space, stars apparently stop spinning down temporarily. Hints of this phenomenon have been present in the literature focused on younger open clusters for a long time, but the definitive evidence only emerged once the 1-Gyr-old K dwarfs of NGC 6811 were found rotating at the same rate as the 700-Myr-old ones in Praesepe. The data for the older clusters also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses, such that early-M dwarfs remain stalled for at least one Gyr. This temporary pause tends to flatten out older mass versus rotation sequences compared to the more steep sequences seen in younger clusters. To accurately age-date isolated low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this temporary pause in spin down. Empirically tuning a core-envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, have not yet been ruled out., We have observed 130 cluster stars with Robo-AO in 2013 while it was on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (see Curtis 2016PhDT.......246C), of which 50 are dwarfs less massive than the 1.4M<SUB>ȯ</SUB> cutoff for this study. See Section 2.3.3. <P />Our team petitioned to adjust the pointing for K2's Campaign 7 so that it covered Ruprecht 147, which we then proposed to monitor (GO proposal 7035). Our GO program was allocated 1086 individual apertures for candidate members. A series of contiguous apertures, a ""superstamp"", was created to tile the inner cluster core in response to a different proposal and covered 96 additional candidates from our preliminary membership list (Cody+ 2018RNAAS...2Q..25C). See Section 3.1. <P />We monitored Ruprecht 147 from 2012 April 29 to 2012 October 7 as part of the PTF Open Cluster Survey. This survey used the robotic 48-inch Oschin (P48) telescope at Palomar Observatory, CA. See Section 3.2. <P />(2 data files)., Over 4000 planet candidates were discovered by the Kepler mission. The sizes, atmospheres, and orbits of exoplanets evolve over billions of years, and precise ages are needed for understanding the evolutionary processes governing these changes. However, most exoplanets have ages that are quite uncertain, particularly those hosted by low-mass K and M dwarfs. For example, consider Keplers 52 and 968: these mid-K dwarfs each host multiple small planets, and each have isochronal ages between 3 and 16 Gyr spanning nearly the entire history of the Universe, offering us little insight, until now. We recognized that these stars are associated together with 395 other stars in the Theia 520 group, which was identified by Kounkel &amp; Covey (2019) in the Gaia DR2 astrometric data set. First, we established that Theia 520 is indeed a coeval population by completing a stellar rotation census of its candidate members using light curves from Kepler, TESS, and ZTF. We found a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars consistent with a 400-Myr-old empirical gyrochronology relation defined by the open clusters M39 and M48. Next, we gathered spectroscopic metallicities from APOGEE and LAMOST to determine that Theia 520 has a solar chemical composition, then combined the spectroscopic temperatures with Gaia photometric colors to calculate the foreground interstellar reddening. With these critical ingredients in hand, we fit PARSEC isochrones to the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and found an age of 380 ± 50 Myr in line with our empirical gyrochronology result. Given that Keplers 52 and 968 have 3D kinematics (from Gaia astrometry and Keck/HIRES radial velocities) consistent with membership and rotation periods placing them on Theia 520's fully converged, slowly rotating sequence, we consider their membership to be confirmed. As their multiple planets have already been validated, we can now apply Theia 520's precise and accurate 400 Myr age to them, and begin using them as benchmarks for studying how exoplanets evolve. Our approach has remarkably shown that two old Kepler hosts are actually related to each other, and that they are quite young. This is only the beginning. Gaia has shown that the greater solar neighborhood within 1 kpc is teeming with coeval populations, some stretching hundreds of parsecs in space like the Pisces-Eridanus stellar stream, others arranged in more amorphous distributions, and some that are dense clusters with halos and tails. Like Theia 520, some of these groupings are home to already known and validated planets, as well as planet candidates, with more waiting to be discovered with the ongoing TESS mission., It has been recently claimed that the Sun's activity is abnormally low relative to analogous stars observed by NASA's Kepler space telescope (Reinhold et al. 2020). Stars were identified that have temperatures, luminosities, and rotation periods that are similar to the modern Sun. Using the range of photometric variability as a proxy for magnetic activity (R<SUB>var</SUB>), the activity levels of stars in this sample reach values much higher than that of the contemporary Sun. The implication is that the Sun's magnetic dynamo (and associated phenomena like variations in total solar irradiance, high-energy emission, and flaring events) could also exhibit much higher excursions in the future or the recent past. <P />However, the primary conclusion of the Reinhold et al. study is due to a biased sample of solar twins stemming from an erroneous temperature scale, rather than an abnormally inactive Sun. The temperatures used to assemble the solar analog sample are biased toward warmer values by ~200 K, resulting in the sample actually being composed of early-K and late-G dwarfs instead of true solar analogs. Since magnetic activity tightly correlates with Rossby number, it makes sense that such stars are naturally more active while spinning at the solar rate due to their larger convective zones, longer convective turnover times, and therefore smaller Rossby numbers. Compiling a list of true solar analogs observed by Kepler is challenging due to the fact that their rotation periods are difficult to measure in broadband optical light. However, the few stars that can be curated have activity levels on par with the Sun's present day range. This is consistent with other results from stellar astrophysics; for example, the chromospheric activity survey of solar twin stars in the 4-Gyr-old M67 cluster found activity levels consistent with the Sun's contemporary range., Recent measurements of rotation periods in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), NGC 6811 (1 Gyr), NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr), Ruprecht 147 (2.7 Gyr), and M67 (4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass-period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses, where 0.5 solar mass stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. This process tends to flatten out the slowly rotating sequences over time, where by 2.7 Gyr (the age of Ruprecht 147), the stars with effective temperatures within 3700-6000 K all rotate at approximately the same rate (22 ± 2 days). Empirically tuning a core-envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out. <P />The attached figure shows rotation data for a selection of benchmarks, together with a model based on the rotation sequence for Praesepe, projected in time using the Skumanich law (P<SUB>rot</SUB> = t<SUP>1/2</SUP>). Clearly, this formula is no longer viable., Recent measurements of rotation periods ( ${P}_{\mathrm{rot}}$ ) in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), NGC 6811 (1 Gyr), and NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass-period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the K2 mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure ${P}_{\mathrm{rot}}$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7 Gyr old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the Kepler ${P}_{\mathrm{rot}}$ data for the approximately coeval cluster NGC 6819 (30 stars with M<SUB>⋆</SUB> &gt; 0.85 ${M}_{\odot }$ ), our new measurements more than double the number of ≈2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to ≈0.55 ${M}_{\odot }$ . The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 ± 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the Kepler intermediate-period gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which stars resume spinning down and find that 0.55 ${M}_{\odot }$ stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core-envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out., Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (&lt;=1M<SUB>ȯ</SUB>). Unfortunately, rotation period (P<SUB>rot</SUB>) measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., P_rot∝age<SUP>0.5</SUP>): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Agueros+ (2018, J/ApJ/862/33) interpreted data for the ~1.4Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf P<SUB>rot</SUB> stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the ~1Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure P<SUB>rot</SUB> for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from ~0.8 to ~0.6M<SUB>ȯ</SUB>. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04+/-0.07Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-P<SUB>rot</SUB> sequence deviates away from the naive 1Gyr projection down to T<SUB>eff</SUB>~4295K (K5V, 0.7M_ȯ), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with P<SUB>rot</SUB> for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where P<SUB>rot</SUB> stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars. <P />(1 data file)., Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (&lt;1 solar masses). Unfortunately, rotation period measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., square-root of age): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Agüeros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the 1.4-Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf rotation periods stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We used data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the 1-Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measured rotation periods for 170 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from 0.8 to 0.6 solar masses. Standard gyrochronology relations applied to the G dwarfs show it to be 1 Gyr in age, consistent with the isochrone solution. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-period sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to 4300 K (K5V, 0.7 solar masses), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with rotation data for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where rotation periods stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars (Curtis et al. 2019). We will offer one method for reformulating the empirical relations using periods from older clusters (e.g., NGC 6819, Ruprecht 147, and M67) to tune the stalling timescale, and we will show how these new data can be used to recalibrate theoretical angular momentum evolution models (e.g., core-envelope coupling timescales), so that both classes of models accurately describe the discrete phases of stellar spin-down., We downloaded the calibrated pixel-level data from the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), extracted a light curve, and corrected for K2 systematic effects following Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014PASP..126..948V). See section 2 for further explanations. <P />On 2016 July 15, we used the MIKE spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile to acquire a spectrum of K2-231 with the 0.70"" slit, corresponding to a spectral resolution of R=42000. <P />We also acquired natural guide star AO imaging in K' (λ=2.124um) with NIRC2 on the Keck II telescope. The observations were acquired, reduced, and analyzed following Kraus+ (2016, J/AJ/152/8). <P />EPIC 219800881 was also targeted by the following programs: ""Statistics of Variability in Main-Sequence Stars of Kepler 2 Fields 6 and 7"" (PI: Guzik; GO 7016), ""The Masses and Prevalence of Small Planets with K2--Cycle 2"" (PI: Howard; GO 7030), and ""K2 follow-up of the nearby, old open cluster Ruprecht 147"" (PI: Nascimbeni; GO 7056). <P />(1 data file)., TESS (Ricker et al. 2015JATIS...1a4003R) is currently conducting a year-long photometric monitoring campaign of the southern sky. TESS scans the sky in a series of sectors for ~27 days at a time. Full-frame images (FFI) are recorded with a 30 m cadence. As of writing, FFI data for the first five sectors have been released to the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Meingast et al. (2019, J/A+A/622/L13) published a list of 256 candidate members of the Psc-Eri stream. We used the Web TESS Viewing Tool (WTV) to identify stars observed during Sectors 1-5, and we found 154 with data from at least one sector. We downloaded 20x20 pixel cutouts of the FFI images centered on each target using the TESScut tool hosted at MAST (Brasseur et al. 2019ascl.soft05007B). Next, we used the IDL procedure aper.pro from the IDL Astronomy User's Library (Landsman 1993ASPC...52..246L) to perform aperture photometry on all epochs in the image stack produced by TESScut. We used a circular aperture with a three-pixel radius (~1' based on TESS's ~21"" pixel scale). <P />(2 data files)., Pisces-Eridanus (Psc-Eri), a nearby (d ≃ 80-226 pc) stellar stream stretching across ≈120° of the sky, was recently discovered with Gaia data. The stream was claimed to be ≈1 Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars λ Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color-magnitude data for these highest-mass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., ≈120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters., Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (≤slant 1 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>). Unfortunately, rotation period ({P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}}) measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., {P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} \propto \sqrt{age}}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Agüeros et al. interpreted data for the ≈1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf {P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the ≈1 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure {P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from ≈ 0.8 to ≈0.6 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04 ± 0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-{P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to {T}<SUB>{{eff</SUB>}}≈ 4295 K (K5V, 0.7 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe’s. Combining these data with {P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where {P}<SUB>{{rot</SUB>}} stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars., Gyrochronology has been demonstrated to work at least up to the age of the Sun for F and G dwarfs. What comes later remains controversial, where periods for Kepler's asteroseismic touchstone stars have been used to argue for a reduced braking efficiency at older ages (van Saders et al. 2016). However, this effect should not affect K dwarfs (0.6-0.9 solar masses), which are even more problematic to age-date with isochrone methods than F and G dwarfs. The difficulty with calibrating K dwarfs gyrochronology is that few are known with published periods that have precise ages older than the Hyades or Praesepe (~650 Myr). This is because asteroseismology is not effective for this class of stars and those located in the older clusters surveyed with Kepler (NGCs 6811 and 6819) are too faint. Our ""K2 Survey of Ruprecht 147"" program (GO 7035) remedies this by expanding the sample of 2.5 Gyr rotators from 0.85 solar masses from NGC 6819 down to 0.5 solar masses in Ruprecht 147. Our new sample shows tension with expectations from various empirical models (e.g., Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand 2008, Barnes 2010, Angus et al. 2015), semi-physical models (e.g., van Saders et al. 2013, Matt et al. 2015), and the observed Praesepe period sequence projected forward in time to the age of Ruprecht 147 with the Skumanich Law, all of which predict periods for K dwarfs much longer than observed in the Ruprecht 147. This result is consistent with the mass-dependent epoch of stalled braking suggested by Agüeros et al. (2018)., Gyrochronology has been demonstrated to work at least up to the age of the Sun for F and G dwarfs.

This result is consistent with the mass-dependent epoch of stalled braking suggested by Agüeros et al. (2018)., We identify a sub-Neptune exoplanet (R <SUB> p </SUB> = 2.5 ± 0.2 {R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>) transiting a solar twin in the Ruprecht 147 star cluster (3 Gyr, 300 pc, [Fe/H] = +0.1 dex). The ∼81 day light curve for EPIC 219800881 (V = 12.71) from K2 Campaign 7 shows six transits with a period of 13.84 days, a depth of ∼0.06%, and a duration of ∼4 hr. Based on our analysis of high-resolution MIKE spectra, broadband optical and NIR photometry, the cluster parallax and interstellar reddening, and isochrone models from PARSEC, Dartmouth, and MIST, we estimate the following properties for the host star: M <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1.01 ± 0.03 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, R <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.95 ± 0.03 {R}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, and {T}<SUB>{{eff</SUB>}} = 5695 ± 50 K. This star appears to be single based on our modeling of the photometry, the low radial velocity (RV) variability measured over nearly 10 yr, and Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging and aperture-masking interferometry. Applying a probabilistic mass-radius relation, we estimate that the mass of this planet is M <SUB> p </SUB> = 7 + 5 - 3 {M}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>, which would cause an RV semi-amplitude of K = 2 ± 1 {\text{m s}}<SUP>-1</SUP> that may be measurable with existing precise RV facilities. After statistically validating this planet with BLENDER, we now designate it K2-231b, making it the second substellar object to be discovered in Ruprecht 147 and the first planet; it joins the small but growing ranks of 22 other planets and three candidates found in open clusters., We know chromospheric emission decays over time, and yet this empirical relation is still fundamentally an interpolation over 3.5 Gyr from the Hyades to the Sun despite 45 years of progress. Furthermore, its very existence was called into question by Pace et al. (2004, 2009, 2013), who argued that activity plummets and flatlines around 1-2 Gyr. I will present new Ca II H &amp; K data for NGC 752 (1.5 Gyr) and Ruprecht 147 (3 Gyr), and ISM-corrected data for M67 (4 Gyr, Curtis 2017), and pair this with the Sun's re-calibrated history (Egeland et al. 2017) and data on field stars from the Keck exoplanet program. I calculated ages for the field star sample using the [Y/Mg] ""chemical clock,"" which was discovered from studies of solar twins and is due to galactic chemical enrichment. I find a mass dependence that matches the prediction from the activity-rotation-age relation of Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand (2008), where F stars rapidly plummet at 1-2 Gyr in line with the observations of F stars in clusters of similar age by Pace et al., whereas activity continuously declines for G and K dwarfs to approximately 5 and 7 Gyr, respectively. I will show that comparing ages estimated from [Y/Mg] to activity--rotation ages reveals known hot Jupiter hosts and other potentially anomalous stars. Combining the empirical relation between activity and Rossby number with estimates of stellar mass from spectroscopy and age from [Y/Mg] yields a gyrochronology relationship for FG and early K dwarfs that is independent of the cluster age scale and appears consistent with models from Mamajek &amp; Hillenbrand (2008) and Barnes (2010). However, I have separately measured rotation periods for mid to late K dwarfs in 3 Gyr Ruprecht 147 with K2 and I find that they are rotating too rapidly relative to these empirical models and the semi-physical model of Matt et al. (2015). Apparently, K dwarfs spin down more slowly than the Skumanich square-root Law. Determining the K dwarf spin-down law is critical for developing a precise method for age-dating exoplanets hosted by such stars., The solar analogs of M67 let us glimpse the probable behavior of the Sun on timescales surpassing the duration of human civilization. M67 can serve as a solar proxy because its stars share a similar age and composition with the Sun. Previous surveys of M67 observed that 15% of its Sun-like stars exhibited chromospheric activity levels below solar minimum, which suggest that these stars might be in activity-minimum states analogous to the Maunder Minimum. The activity diagnostic used, the HK index (relative intensities of the Ca II H &amp; K lines integrated over 1 Å bandpasses), was measured from low-resolution spectra (R ≈ 5000), as is traditional and suitable for nearby, bright stars. However, for stars beyond the Local Bubble, the interstellar medium (ISM) imprints absorption lines in spectra at Ca II H &amp; K, which negatively bias activity measurements when these lines fall within the HK index bandpass. I model the ISM clouds in the M67 foreground with high-resolution spectra of blue stragglers and solar analogs. I demonstrate that ISM absorption varies across the cluster and must be accounted for on a star-by-star basis. I then apply the ISM model to a solar spectrum and broaden it to the lower spectral resolution employed by prior surveys. Comparing HK indices measured from ISM-free and ISM-contaminated spectra, I find that all stars observed below solar minimum can be explained by this ISM bias. I conclude that there is no compelling evidence for Ma","['2024AAS...24345808C', '2023AAS...24116304C', '2022AAS...24020801C', '2022fysr.confE...4C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.19040140', '2022yCat..19040140C', '2021AAS...23822701C', '2021BAAS...53c1043C', '2021AAS...23741504C', '10.3847/1538-4357/abbf58', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.02272', '2020ApJ...904..140C', 'arXiv:2010.02272', '2020arXiv201002272C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18790049', '2020yCat..18790049C', '2020AAS...23524103C', '2020yCat..51550173C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51550173', '2019yCat..51580077C', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51580077', '2019arXiv190510588C', '10.3847/1538-3881/ab2899', '2019AJ....158...77C', '10.48550/arXiv.1905.10588', 'arXiv:1905.10588', '2019ApJ...879...49C', 'arXiv:1905.06869', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab2393', '10.48550/arXiv.1905.06869', '2019arXiv190506869C', '2019AAS...23344508C', '2019AAS...23323508C', '2018csss.confE..24C', '10.5281/zenodo.1403719', '10.48550/arXiv.1803.07430', '2018AJ....155..173C', '10.3847/1538-3881/aab49c', 'arXiv:1803.07430', '2018arXiv180307430C', '2018AAS...23113304C', '10.3847/1538-3881/aa72e9', '10.48550/arXiv.1705.04711', '2017AJ....153..275C', '2017arXiv170504711C', 'arXiv:1705.04711', '10.5281/zenodo.58758', '2016csss.confE..95C', '2016AAS...22710503C', '2016PhDT.......246C', '2015AAS...22523004C', '2014AAS...22422310C', '2014AAS...22344208C', '2012arXiv1206.6533C', '10.48550/arXiv.1206.6533', '2013AJ....145..134C', '10.1088/0004-6256/145/5/134', 'arXiv:1206.6533', '2013AAS...22125017C', '2012noao.prop..315C', '2012AAS...21915126C', '2011AAS...21813301C', '2011BAAS..43G13301C', '2011AAS...21715229C', '2011BAAS...4315229C', '2006HEAD....9.1370C', '2006BAAS...38.1290C', '2005AAS...207.8123C', '2005BAAS...37.1304C']","[('star', 99), ('cluster', 93), ('age', 86), ('gyr', 65), ('mass', 63), ('dwarf', 52), ('period', 42), ('ruprecht', 42), ('solar', 41), ('data', 39)]","[(('open', 'cluster'), 27), (('rotation', 'period'), 18), (('low', 'mass'), 17), (('solar', 'mass'), 14), (('magnetic', 'activity'), 13), (('solar', 'analog'), 12), (('mass', 'star'), 11), (('stellar', 'astrophysics'), 9), (('cluster', 'ngc'), 9), (('ngc', 'gyr'), 9)]","[(('low', 'mass', 'stars'), 7), (('gyr', 'cluster', 'ngc'), 6), (('reduced', 'braking', 'efficiency'), 6), (('ca', 'ii', 'amp'), 5), (('ag', 'eros', 'al'), 5), (('fundamental', 'stellar', 'astrophysics'), 5), (('ngc', 'gyr', 'ruprecht'), 4), (('gyr', 'ruprecht', 'gyr'), 4), (('tight', 'sequence', 'slowly'), 4), (('sequence', 'slowly', 'rotating'), 4)]",Dirty

goddess Nut represented the Milky Way by examining Nut's visual depictions on ancient Egyptian coffins. I assemble a catalog of 555 coffin elements, including 118 cosmological vignettes from the 21st/22nd Dynasties, and report several observations. First, the cosmological vignette on the outer coffin of Nesitaudjatakhet bears a unique feature: a thick, undulating black curve that bisects Nut's star-studded body and recalls the Great Rift that cleaves the Milky Way in two. Similar undulating curves bisect the astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Seti I and appear as part of depictions of Nut in the tombs of Ramesses IV, VI, and IX. Moreover, the undulating curve resembles similar features identified as the Milky Way on the bodies of Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni spiritual beings. Hence, I argue that the undulating curve is a visual representation of the Milky Way and that it supports a previously suggested identification of the Winding Waterway as the Galaxy's Egyptian name. However, the rarity of this feature strengthens the conclusion reached by Graur (2024a): Though Nut and the Milky Way are linked, they are not synonymous. Instead of acting as a representation of Nut, the Milky Way is one more celestial phenomenon that, like the Sun and the stars, is associated with Nut in her role as the sky. Second, Nut's body is decorated with stars in only a quarter of the cosmological vignettes, suggesting that the Egyptians of the 21st/22nd Dynasties may have had a marked preference for the day sky over the night sky. Finally, I discuss the interplay between Nut's cosmological vignette and full-length portraits inside coffins from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period in the context of Nut's combined cosmological and eschatological roles as an embodiment of the coffin., An eminently readable overview of the history and physics of galaxies. <P />In Galaxies, Or Graur offers a brief and fascinating overview of the history, physics, and astrophysical uses of galaxies. Starting with the history of the last two thousand years of galaxy studies, Graur discusses the types of galaxies we observe and the physics that drive them; the myths and physical structure of the Milky Way; how galaxies were used to discover and study the mysterious phenomena of dark matter and dark energy; and how scientists think galaxies formed shortly after the Big Bang and evolved to their present forms. <P />Tracing galaxy studies back thousands of years ago to their beginnings, Graur describes their origin in Ptolemy's book Almagest, which was written in the first century CE. The reader will also encounter in this book well-known figures such as William Herschel, who, along with his sister Caroline (the first professional female astronomer), discovered hundreds of galaxies and lay the foundations for modern galaxy studies, as well as lesser-known astronomers, including tenth-century Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, twentieth-century American astronomer Vesto Melvin Slipher, and others. Galaxies concludes by showing readers how they can get involved in galaxy studies themselves and do their part to fight the light pollution that today obscures the Milky Way and all but the brightest of stars. <P />Providing a brief but broad overview of galaxies for the nonspecialist, Galaxies shows just how modern science is done and what the future holds for this specific field of astronomy., Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have long been used as standard candles to measure extragalactic distances and cosmological parameters. SNe Ia are portrayed as a homogeneous class, but there are actually several subtypes. Even the ""normal"" SNe Ia used for cosmology may not be homogeneous. Recently, the optical light curves of SNe Ia have been shown to slow down, relative to their earlier decline rate, at &gt;800 days after explosion. Moreover, more luminous SNe Ia may slow down faster than less luminous objects. This correlation, which recalls the peak-light stretch-luminosity relation used to standardize SNe Ia, also hints at the existence of several production channels for normal SNe Ia, as no single explosion model can produce the full range of late-time light curves. But this new correlation is based on just 6 objects. We ask for 67 WFC3/UVIS orbits (with the F438W, F555W, and F814W filters) spread over Cycles 30-32 to observe 12 SNe Ia when they are 600-1200 days old. By tripling the sample of late-time SNe Ia, we will prove the existence of the new stretch-luminosity correlation at a significance of &gt;5-sigma. The impact on SN cosmology will be twofold. First, a new stretch-luminosity correlation could further standardize SNe Ia and reduce systematic uncertainties. Second, strong evidence for the existence of multiple production channels for normal SNe Ia would force cosmologists to revisit their use of SNe Ia as a monolithic class. This experiment is time critical. Every year, on average, &lt;5 SNe Ia can be used for this experiment. We are lucky to have 12 targets to work with this year; this chance may not come again during HST's remaining lifetime., It is widely accepted that the width-luminosity relation used to standardize normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) breaks down in underluminous, 1991bg-like SNe Ia. This breakdown may be due to the choice of parameter used as a stand-in for the width of the SN Ia light curve. Using the colour stretch parameter s<SUB>BV</SUB> instead of older parameters resolves this issue. Here, I assemble a sample of 14 nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia from the literature, all of which have independent host-galaxy distance moduli and little to no reddening. I use Gaussian process regression to fit the light curves of these SNe in U/u, B, V, g, R/r, I/i, and H, and measure their peak absolute magnitudes. I find statistically significant (&gt;5σ confidence level in the optical and &gt;4σ in the near-infrared) correlations between the peak absolute magnitudes of the 1991bg-like SNe Ia and their s<SUB>BV</SUB> values in the range 0.2 &lt; s<SUB>BV</SUB> &lt; 0.6. These correlations are broadly consistent with fits to s<SUB>BV</SUB> &lt; 0.7 SNe Ia with preliminary B- and V-band peak absolute magnitudes from the Carnegie Supernova Project and significantly inconsistent with similar fits to normal and transitional SNe Ia (with 0.7 &lt; s<SUB>BV</SUB> &lt; 1.1). The underluminous width-luminosity relation shown here needs to be properly calibrated with a homogeneous sample of 1991bg-like SNe Ia, after which it could be used as a rung on a new cosmological distance ladder. With surface-brightness fluctuations (or another non-Cepheid method) used to calibrate distances to nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia, such a ladder could produce an independent measurement of the Hubble-Lemaître constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>., Astronomical simulations and ancient Egyptian texts show the Milky Way was linked to the ancient Egyptian sky goddess Nut. This fits within multicultural myths about our home galaxy., The Milky Way's name and role in ancient Egyptian culture remain unclear. One suggestion is that the Milky Way may have been a celestial depiction of the sky goddess Nut. In this work, I test this association using an interdisciplinary approach. In the first part of this paper, I combine astronomical simulations of the ancient Egyptian night sky with primary Egyptian sources to map the goddess Nut onto the Milky Way. With her head and groin firmly associated by primary texts with the western and eastern horizons, respectively, I argue that the summer and winter orientations of the Milky Way could be construed as figurative markers of Nut's torso (or backbone) and her arms, respectively. In the second part of this paper, I situate Nut within the global, multicultural mythology of the Milky Way. Specifically, I show that Nut's roles in the afterlife and the autumn bird migration are consistent with similar roles attributed to the Milky Way by other cultures. Finally, I show that Nut's identification with the Milky Way may even have echoes in contemporary African conceptions of the Galaxy., Near-infrared (NIR) observations of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained between 150 and 500 d past maximum light reveal the existence of an extended plateau. Here, we present observations of the underluminous, 1991bg-like SN 2021qvv. Early, ground-based optical and NIR observations show that SN 2021qvv is similar to SN 2006mr, making it one of the dimmest, fastest evolving 1991bg-like SNe to date. Late-time (170-250 d) Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2021qvv reveal no sign of a plateau. An extrapolation of these observations backwards to earlier-phase NIR observations of SN 2006mr suggests the complete absence of an NIR plateau, at least out to 250 d. This absence may be due to a higher ionization state of the ejecta, as predicted by certain sub-Chandrasekhar-mass detonation models, or to the lower temperatures of the ejecta of 1991bg-like SNe, relative to normal SNe Ia, which might preclude their becoming fluorescent and shifting ultraviolet light into the NIR. This suggestion can be tested by acquiring NIR imaging of a sample of 1991bg-like SNe that covers the entire range from slowly evolving to fast-evolving events (0.2 ≲ s<SUB>BV</SUB> ≲ 0.6). A detection of the NIR plateau in slower evolving, hotter 1991bg-like SNe would provide further evidence that these SNe exist along a continuum with normal SNe Ia. Theoretical progenitor and explosion scenarios would then have to match the observed properties of both SN Ia subtypes., Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have long been used as standard candles to measure extragalactic distances and cosmological parameters. SNe Ia are portrayed as a homogeneous class, but there are actually several subtypes. Even the ""normal"" SNe Ia used for cosmology may not be homogeneous.

We are lucky to have 12 targets to work with this year; this chance may not come again during HST's remaining lifetime., We ask for 6 WFC3 orbits to obtain G141 grism spectra of two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in order to ascertain why the newly-discovered near-infrared (NIR) year-long plateau at ~150-500 days comes to an end. SNe Ia have long been used as standard candles to measure extragalactic distances and constrain cosmology, yet the nature of their progenitor stars and the physics behind their explosions remain open questions. The recent discovery of the NIR plateau highlights just how much we still have to learn about the physics of these explosions. In this proposal, we aim to learn why the NIR plateau comes to an end at ~450-500 days past maximum light. The discoverers of the plateau proposed that a change in the dominant ionization state of the SN ejecta, from singly-ionized to neutral iron-group lines, may be the cause. However, this explanation rests on a dubious detection of neutral iron lines in a low signal-to-noise (S/N) grism spectrum of a single SN Ia at 600 days. We will obtain higher S/N spectra of two brighter SNe Ia and optimize the orients of our observations to properly subtract any contamination from the bright host galaxies of our targets. This will allow us to unambiguously detect any [Fe I] lines in our spectra, if they exist. By visiting our targets at additional, earlier epochs along the plateau we will also determine whether such [Fe I] lines exist along the plateau, something that could not be done with previous, ground-based spectra where these lines fell in atmospheric absorption bands. The results of our observations will provide fresh constraints on the chemical composition of the progenitors prior to explosion as well as the evolution of the SN ejecta., A concise introduction to the history and physics of supernovae, the brilliant explosions of stars; with striking color illustrations. <P />Supernovae are the explosions of stars. They are some of the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, rivaling the combined light of billions of stars. Supernovae have been studied for centuries, and they have also made appearances in popular culture: a glimpse of a supernova in a painting provides Sherlock Holmes with a crucial clue, for example. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, astrophysicist Or Graur offers a concise and accessible introduction to these awe-inspiring astronomical phenomena. <P />Graur explains that a deep observational understanding of supernovae—why and how they shine and how their brightness changes over time—allows us to use them as tools for experiments in astrophysics and physics. A certain type of supernova, for example, brightens and fades in such a predictable manner that we can measure the distances to their host galaxies. We owe our existence to supernovae—they give us iron for our blood and calcium for our bones. But supernovae may also have caused a mass extinction event on Earth 2.6 million years ago. <P />Graur shows how observations of supernovae played a role in the transformation of astronomy from astrology to astrophysics; surveys the tools used to study supernovae today; and describes the lives and deaths of stars and the supernova remnants, neutron stars, and black holes they leave behind. Illustrations in both color and black and white, many from Graur's own Hubble Space Telescope data, make this account of supernovae particularly vivid., We ask for 3 WFC3/UVIS orbits to obtain F438W, F555W, and F814W images of the location of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2017erp. We recently discovered a point source at the location of the SN in WFC3/IR observations taken during Feb. and Sep. 2021. We rule out the SN itself or a light echo. Instead, the object is consistent with a subgiant or red giant at a temperature of ~5000 K, but with an abnormally high luminosity of ~33,000 Solar luminosities. It may be a clump of red giants or a globular cluster at or behind the location of the SN. No other SN Ia has ever been directly associated with such a stellar group. A more exciting possibility is that this object is the shock-heated surviving companion of SN 2017erp's progenitor. If so, this will be the first-ever detection of a surviving companion in a normal SN Ia. It would also provide direct evidence of the ""single degenerate"" channel whereby a white dwarf explodes after accreting matter from a main sequence or evolved star. WFC3/UVIS has a higher resolution than WFC3/IR, which will allow us to precisely test the object's coincidence with the SN and determine whether it is resolved or not. The images will also flesh out the object's spectral energy distribution, for a more accurate classification, temperature, and luminosity. We ask for DD time so that these observations will be scheduled during 3-10 January 2022 or 14-28 February 2022, when one last infrared visit to this field is planned. By obtaining optical and infrared images at the same time, we will gain a complete snapshot of the object at a single moment in time, providing a baseline for comparison with any future observations to test the object's variability., We ask for 4 WFC3 orbits to observe the subluminous 1991bg-like Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2021qvv when it is 150-250 days past maximum light. With observations in F125W (J), F160W (H), and F350LP (optical) in each of four visits, we will determine whether this SN Ia subtype undergoes a similar near-infrared (NIR) plateau as the one recently discovered in so-called ""normal"" SNe Ia. The latter have long been used as standard candles in cosmology, yet the nature of their progenitors and explosion mechanism remains elusive. The abundance of SN Ia subtypes, including 1991bg-like SNe Ia, only complicates matters. It is still unclear whether several (or all) SN Ia subtypes share the same progenitor and explosion method as normal SNe Ia, or whether each subtype originates in a different type of star and explosion physics. The first option ties into the nagging question of how standard SNe Ia really are as standard candles. Revealing the progenitors of normal SNe Ia and the other SN Ia subtypes would go some way to answering this question. The recently discovered NIR plateau at 150-500 days offers a new way to constrain the progenitors and explosion physics. In normal SNe Ia, this plateau could be a third NIR maximum, similar to the second NIR maximum seen shortly after the first peak. These additional peaks could be due to the recombination of iron in the expanding ejecta. These secondary NIR peaks are not seen in 1991bg-like SNe Ia, a fact used to constrain the mass, temperature, and chemical composition of the progenitor. The presence or absence of the late-time NIR plateau in 1991bg-like SNe would place further constraints on the progenitor and the recombination wave model., We ask for 6 WFC3 orbits to obtain G141 grism spectra of two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in order to ascertain why the newly-discovered near-infrared (NIR) year-long plateau at ~150-500 days comes to an end. SNe Ia have long been used as standard candles to measure extragalactic distances and constrain cosmology, yet the nature of their progenitor stars and the physics behind their explosions remain open questions.

In this proposal, we aim to learn why the NIR plateau comes to an end at ~450-500 days past maximum light. The discoverers of the plateau proposed that a change in the dominant ionization state of the SN ejecta, from singly-ionized to neutral iron-group lines, may be the cause. However, this explanation rests on a dubious detection of neutral iron lines in a low signal-to-noise (S/N) grism spectrum of a single SN Ia at 600 days. We will obtain higher S/N spectra of two brighter SNe Ia and optimize the orients of our observations to properly subtract any contamination from the bright host galaxies of our targets. This will allow us to unambiguously detect any [Fe I] lines in our spectra, if they exist. By visiting our targets at additional, earlier epochs along the plateau we will also determine whether such [Fe I] lines exist along the plateau, something that could not be done with previous, ground-based spectra where these lines fell in atmospheric absorption bands. The results of our observations will provide fresh constraints on the chemical composition of the progenitors prior to explosion as well as the evolution of the SN ejecta., We ask for 8 WFC3 orbits to observe four Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) when they are ~230-430 days past maximum light. At these phases, normal SNe Ia have been shown to undergo a plateau phase in the near-infrared (NIR) while continuing to decline in the optical. Our sample consists of two normal SNe Ia and two peculiar SNe Iax. With two visits per SN during this phase range, we will use observations in F125W (J), F160W (H), F336W (U), and F350LP (optical) to: (1) confirm the J-band plateau for normal SNe Ia; (2) test whether the plateau is caused by scattering of photons from the UV/optical to the NIR; (3) test whether SNe Iax also exhibit a NIR plateau; and (4) detect the surviving white dwarf progenitors of SNe Iax. At late times, observations drive theory, and ours will help shed light on the progenitor and explosion physics of both normal SNe Ia and their peculiar Iax cousins., The light curves of type Ia supernovae are routinely used to constrain cosmology models. Driven by radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, the light curves steadily decline over time, but after 150 d post-explosion the near-infrared portion is poorly characterized. We report a year-long plateau in the near-infrared light curve at 150-500 d, followed by a second decline phase accompanied by a possible appearance of [Fe I] emission lines. This near-infrared plateau contrasts sharply with type IIP plateaux and requires a new physical mechanism. We suggest a masking of the `near-infrared catastrophe'—a predicted, yet unobserved, sharp light-curve decline—by scattering of ultraviolet photons to longer wavelengths. The transition off the plateau could be due to a change in the dominant ionization state of the supernova ejecta. Our results help explain the complex radiative transfer processes that take place in type Ia supernovae and enhance their use as `standard candles'., , , We ask for 4 orbits of WFC3 to complete observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2018gv conducted by HST program GO-15145. SNe Ia have long been used to measure extragalactic distances and constrain the cosmological parameters. However, the nature of their progenitors remains elusive, which adds a systematic uncertainty to their use as standard candles. Recently, late-time observations of SNe Ia (&gt;500 days after maximum light) have provided a new diagnostic of SN Ia progenitor, explosion, and nebular physics. Here, we ask for 4 orbits of WFC3 to complete observe SN 2018gv out to 700 days past maximum light and explore its NIR light curve., Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, yet the evolutionary mechanisms leading to such events remain unknown. Many proposed channels, including the classical single-degenerate scenario, invoke a hot, luminous evolutionary phase for the progenitor, in which it is a prodigious source of photoionizing emission. Here, we examine the environment of SN 2014J for evidence of a photoionized nebula in pre- and post-explosion [O III] λ5007 Å and H β images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. From the absence of any extended emission, we exclude a stable nuclear-burning white dwarf at the location of SN 2014J in the last ∼100 000 years, assuming a typical warm interstellar medium (ISM) particle density of 1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. These limits greatly exceed existing X-ray constraints at temperatures typical of known supersoft sources. Significant extreme-UV/soft X-ray emission prior to explosion remains plausible for lower ISM densities (e.g. n_ISM∼ 0.1 {cm}^{-3}). In this case, however, any putative nebula would be even more extended, allowing deeper follow-up observations to resolve this ambiguity in the near future., The late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), taken 500-1000 days after explosion, provide a new source of information on the progenitors of these SNe and how they explode. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope observations of three SNe Ia (SNe 2012cg, 2015F, and ASASSN-14lp; Graur et al. 2016, 2018b,c, respectively) and compare them to to SNe 2011fe (Shappee et al. 2017) and 2014J (Yang et al. 2018). We show that, starting roughly 800 days after explosion, the light curves of all but one of these SNe Ia diverge from what would be expected if they were still dominated purely by the radioactive decay of 56Co. Instead, the light curves begin to slow down their decline. This slow-down may be caused by the additional radioactive decay of the longer-lived 57Co; by atomic freeze-out; by a changing fraction of positron trapping; or by some combination of these (and perhaps other) processes. Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between the rate at which each light curve slows down and the luminosity of the SN. If this correlation is borne out by further observations, it will represent a new diagnostic of SN Ia progenitor, explosion, and nebular physics., The last decade has seen a proliferation of mentoring programs that provide high-school students authentic research experiences. Such programs expose students to front-line research, equip them with basic research skills (including coding skills), and introduce them to scientist role models. Mentors in such programs range from undergraduate students to faculty members. Here, I describe the founding and operation of the Harvard Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP). This program specifically recruits advanced graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to serve as mentors. By mentoring high-school students over a long timescale (September to May), early-career scientists gain hands-on experience in the skills required to advise students—skills that are often required of them in future academic positions yet seldom taught by academic institutions. I show that SRMPs can easily and quickly be set up and provide guidance and resources to do so. Finally, I invite directors of existing and prospective SRMPs to join the Global SPHERE Network, through which directors of SRMPs around the world can share their experiences, best practices, and questions., Recent works have studied the late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) when these were older than 500 days past B-band maximum light. Of these, SN 2014J, which exploded in the nearby galaxy M82, was studied with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) by Yang et al. Here, I report complementary photometry of SN 2014J taken with the HST Wide Field Camera 3 when it was ∼360-1300 days old. My F555W measurements are consistent with the F606W measurements of Yang et al., but the F438W measurements are ∼1 mag fainter than their F475W measurements. I corroborate their finding that, even though SN 2014J has spatially resolved light echoes, its photometry is not contaminated by an unresolved echo. Finally, I compare the F438W and F555W light curves of SN 2014J to those of the other late-time SNe Ia observed to date and show that more intrinsically luminous SNe have slower light curve decline rates. This is consistent with the correlation claimed by Graur et al., which was based on a comparison of pseudo-bolometric light curves. By conducting a direct comparison of the late-time light curves in the same filters, I remove any systematic uncertainties introduced by the assumptions that go into constructing the pseudo-bolometric light curves, thus strengthening the Graur et al. claim., , Late-time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), &gt;900 days after explosion, have shown that this type of SN does not suffer an “IR catastrophe” at 500 days as previously predicted. Instead, several groups have observed a slow-down in the optical light curves of these SNe. A few reasons have been suggested for this slow-down, from a changing fraction of positrons reprocessed by the expanding ejecta, through a boost of energy from slow radioactive decay chains such as <SUP>57</SUP>Co→<SUP>57</SUP>Fe, to atomic “freeze-out.” Discovering which of these (or some other) heating mechanisms is behind the slow-down will directly impact studies of SN Ia progenitors, explosion models, and nebular-stage physics. Recently, Graur et al. suggested a possible correlation between the shape of the late-time light curves of four SNe Ia and their stretch values, which are proxies for their intrinsic luminosities. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope observations of the SN Ia ASASSN-14lp at ∼850-960 days past maximum light. With a stretch of s = 1.15 ± 0.05, it is the most luminous normal SN Ia observed so far at these late times. We rule out contamination by light echoes and show that the late-time, optical light curve of ASASSN-14lp is flatter than that of previous SNe Ia observed at late times. This result is in line with—and strengthens—the Graur et al. correlation, but additional observations of SNe are needed to verify it., The last decade has seen a proliferation of mentoring programs that provide high-school students authentic research experiences. Such programs expose students to front-line research, equip them with basic research skills (including coding skills), and introduce them to scientist role models. Mentors in such programs range from undergraduate students to faculty members. Here, I describe the founding and first two years of operation of the Harvard Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP). This program specifically recruits advanced graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to serve as mentors.

Finally, I invite directors of existing and prospective SRMPs to join the Global SPHERE Network, through which directors of SRMPs around the world can share their experiences, best practices, and questions., The late-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observed &gt;900 days after explosion, present the possibility of a new diagnostic for SN Ia progenitor and explosion models. First, however, we must discover what physical process (or processes) leads to the slow-down of the light curve relative to a pure <SUP>56</SUP>Co decay, as observed in SNe 2011fe, 2012cg, and 2014J. We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN 2015F, taken ≈600-1040 days past maximum light. Unlike those of the three other SNe Ia, the light curve of SN 2015F remains consistent with being powered solely by the radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Co. We fit the light curves of these four SNe Ia in a consistent manner and measure possible correlations between the light-curve stretch—a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the SN—and the parameters of the physical model used in the fit. We propose a new, late-time Phillips-like correlation between the stretch of the SNe and the shape of their late-time light curves, which we parameterize as the difference between their pseudo-bolometric luminosities at 600 and 900 days: ΔL <SUB>900</SUB> = log(L <SUB>600</SUB>/L <SUB>900</SUB>). Our analysis is based on only four SNe, so a larger sample is required to test the validity of this correlation. If true, this model-independent correlation provides a new way t","['2024arXiv240910265G', '10.48550/arXiv.2409.10265', 'arXiv:2409.10265', '10.7551/mitpress/14825.001.0001', '2024gala.book.....G', '2024hst..prop17846G', '2023arXiv231116245G', '2024MNRAS.tmp.1002G', '2024MNRAS.530.4950G', 'arXiv:2311.16245', '10.1093/mnras/stae949', '10.48550/arXiv.2311.16245', '2024SciAm.330E...1G', '2024arXiv240401458G', '2024JAHH...27...28G', '10.48550/arXiv.2404.01458', 'arXiv:2404.01458', '2023MNRAS.tmp.2844G', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.12858', '10.1093/mnras/stad2960', '2023arXiv230612858G', '2023MNRAS.526.2977G', 'arXiv:2306.12858', '2023hst..prop17413G', '2022hst..prop17191G', '2022hst..prop17000G', '2022supe.book.....G', '2021hst..prop16903G', '2021hst..prop16884G', '2021hst..prop16885G', '2021hst..prop16497G', '2019arXiv191003614G', '10.1038/s41550-019-0901-1', '2020NatAs...4..188G', 'arXiv:1910.03614', '10.48550/arXiv.1910.03614', '2019NatAs.tmp..463G', '10.1093/mnras/stz914', '2019MNRAS.490.1270G', '2019MNRAS.tmp.1580G', '10.1093/mnrasl/slz063', '2019MNRAS.tmp..887G', '2019MNRAS.486L..89G', '2019hst..prop15693G', 'arXiv:1811.04944', '2019MNRAS.484L..79G', '2018arXiv181104944G', '2019MNRAS.tmpL..12G', '10.1093/mnrasl/slz005', '10.48550/arXiv.1811.04944', '2019AAS...23325810G', '2019AAS...23335205G', '10.3847/1538-4357/aaf1c3', 'arXiv:1810.07258', '2018arXiv181007258G', '10.48550/arXiv.1810.07258', '2019ApJ...870...14G', '10.1119/1.5052428', '2018AmJPh..86..725G', '2018ApJ...866...10G', 'arXiv:1808.00972', '10.48550/arXiv.1808.00972', '2018arXiv180800972G', '10.3847/1538-4357/aadd96', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.08078', '2018arXiv180908078G', 'arXiv:1809.08078', '10.3847/1538-4357/aabe25', '10.48550/arXiv.1711.01275', 'arXiv:1711.01275', '2018ApJ...859...79G', '2017arXiv171101275G', 'arXiv:1707.02986', '2017arXiv170702986G', '10.3847/1538-4357/aaa3fd', '10.48550/arXiv.1707.02986', '2018ApJ...853...39G', '2017yCat..18370120G', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18370120', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa5eb8', '10.48550/arXiv.1609.02921', 'arXiv:1609.02921', '2017ApJ...837..120G', '2016arXiv160902921G', 'arXiv:1609.02923', '10.48550/arXiv.1609.02923', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa5eb7', '2016arXiv160902923G', '2017ApJ...837..121G', '2016hst..prop14611G', '2016ApJ...819...31G', '10.48550/arXiv.1505.00777', '10.3847/0004-637X/819/1/31', 'arXiv:1505.00777', '2015arXiv150500777G', '10.1017/S1743921316005238', '10.48550/arXiv.1509.08432', '2016IAUFM..29B.257G', '2015arXiv150908432G', 'arXiv:1509.08432', '2015IAUGA..2255016G', '2015yCat..74500905G', '2015MNRAS.450..905G', '10.48550/arXiv.1412.7991', '10.1093/mnras/stv713', 'arXiv:1412.7991', '2014arXiv1412.7991G', '2015AAS...22512103G', '2014ATel.6758....1G', '2014hst..prop13799G', '2014MNRAS.442L..28G', '2014arXiv1403.1878G', '2014MNRAS.tmpL..69G', '10.1093/mnrasl/slu052', 'arXiv:1403.1878', '10.48550/arXiv.1403.1878', '2014yCat..74301746G', '10.1088/0004-637X/783/1/28', '10.48550/arXiv.1310.3495', 'arXiv:1310.3495', '2013arXiv1310.3495G', '2014ApJ...783...28G', '2014AAS...22313907G', '2013PhDT.......309G', '2013MNRAS.tmp..689G', '2013MNRAS.430.1746G', '10.1093/mnras/sts718', '10.48550/arXiv.1209.0008', '2012arXiv1209.0008G', 'arXiv:1209.0008', '2013AAS...22113602G', '2012ATel.4535....1G', '2012ATel.4226....1G', '2012ATel.4199....1G', '2012yCat..74170916G', '2012AAS...21924208G', '2011MNRAS.417..916G', 'arXiv:1102.0005', '10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19287.x', '2011arXiv1102.0005G', '2011MNRAS.tmp.1508G', '10.48550/arXiv.1102.0005']","[('ia', 234), ('sne', 195), ('sn', 184), ('galaxy', 110), ('rate', 98), ('supernova', 75), ('type', 70), ('light', 68), ('time', 60), ('star', 56)]","[(('sne', 'ia'), 109), (('sn', 'ia'), 79), (('type', 'ia'), 44), (('light', 'curve'), 41), (('ia', 'supernova'), 35), (('ia', 'rate'), 34), (('late', 'time'), 27), (('normal', 'sne'), 20), (('supernova', 'sne'), 19), (('star', 'formation'), 19)]","[(('type', 'ia', 'supernovae'), 21), (('normal', 'sne', 'ia'), 20), (('sn', 'ia', 'rate'), 20), (('hubble', 'space', 'telescope'), 17), (('type', 'ia', 'supernova'), 14), (('sn', 'ia', 'rates'), 14), (('ia', 'supernovae', 'sne'), 13), (('supernovae', 'sne', 'ia'), 13), (('ia', 'supernova', 'sn'), 10), (('delay', 'time', 'distribution'), 10)]",Dirty

Using almost 15 yr of observation data from Fermi Large Area Telescope, we detected an extended gamma-ray source in this region with a significance of <inline-formula><tex-math id=""TM0001"" notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim 13 \sigma$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The gamma-ray radiation reveals a clear pion-bump feature and can be fitted with the power-law parent proton spectrum with an index of <inline-formula><tex-math id=""TM0002"" notation=""LaTeX"">$-2.5$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The total cosmic ray (CR) proton energy in the gamma-ray production region is estimated to be of the order of <inline-formula><tex-math id=""TM0003"" notation=""LaTeX"">$10^{49}\ \rm erg$</tex-math></inline-formula>. We further derived the CR radial distribution from both the gamma-ray emission and gas distribution and found it roughly obeys the <inline-formula><tex-math id=""TM0004"" notation=""LaTeX"">$1/r$</tex-math></inline-formula> type profile, though a constant profile is not ruled out. This is consistent with other similar systems and expected from the continuous injection of CRs by the central powerful young massive star cluster Danks 1 or Danks 2 in this region. Together with former detections of similar gamma-ray structures, such as Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and W40, the detection supports the hypothesis that young massive star clusters are CR accelerators., The launch of Gaia in 2013 December ushered in a new era of space astrometry, allowing for fundamental reference research at an unprecedented level of precision. The international celestial reference frames in the radio band and the Gaia celestial reference frame in the optical band have been established and are consistent within several microarcseconds for axes orientation. To bridge the gap between the visual and radio bands, an infrared reference frame should be investigated. We present a study aimed at constructing an infrared reference frame using the observations from the AllWISE catalog. It is compared with Gaia DR3 for approximately 0.57 million extragalactic sources and for a full set of 273 million sources. Systematic differences in positions and proper motions, such as magnitude or color equations and vector spherical harmonics, are derived. These systematic differences are comparable to the random errors of AllWISE measurements and can be used to improve the AllWISE source positions and proper motions, making the AllWISE catalog a valuable all-sky reference frame in the infrared band. Our investigation of the AllWISE catalog reveals that extragalactic sources and stars exhibit different astrometric properties. The global difference between the extragalactic source reference frame and the stellar reference frames is found to be 8.6 mas and 13.7 mas for global rotation and glide amplitudes, respectively. Such internal inconsistency should be considered when using AllWISE as an infrared reference frame. Finally, we determine the orientation of the mean Galactic plane using the calibrated source distribution of the AllWISE catalog., Context. An accurate <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S reaction rate is crucial to defining the nucleosynthesis products of explosive hydrogen burning in ONe novae. Using the recently released nuclear mass of <SUP>29</SUP>S, together with a shell model and a direct capture calculation, we reanalyzed the <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S thermonuclear reaction rate and its astrophysical implication. <BR /> Aims: We focus on improving the astrophysical rate for <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S based on the newest nuclear mass data. Our goal is to explore the impact of the new rate and associated uncertainties on the nova nucleosynthesis. <BR /> Methods: We evaluated this reaction rate via the sum of the isolated resonance contribution instead of the previously used Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. The corresponding rate uncertainty at different energies was derived using a Monte Carlo method. Nova nucleosynthesis is computed with the 1D hydrodynamic code SHIVA. <BR /> Results: The contribution from the capture on the first excited state at 105.64 keV in <SUP>28</SUP>P is taken into account for the first time. We find that the capture rate on the first excited state in<SUP>28</SUP> P is up to more than 12 times larger than the ground-state capture rate in the temperature region of 2.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> K to 4 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> K, resulting in the total <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S reaction rate being enhanced by a factor of up to 1.4 at ~1 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> K. In addition, the rate uncertainty has been quantified for the first time. It is found that the new rate is smaller than the previous statistical model rates, but it still agrees with them within uncertainties for nova temperatures. The statistical model appears to be roughly valid for the rate estimation of this reaction in the nova nucleosynthesis scenario. Using the 1D hydrodynamic code SHIVA, we performed the nucleosynthesis calculations in a nova explosion to investigate the impact of the new rates of <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S. Our calculations show that the nova abundance pattern is only marginally affected if we use our new rates with respect to the same simulations but statistical model rates. Finally, the isotopes whose abundance is most influenced by the present <SUP>28</SUP>P(p, γ)<SUP>29</SUP>S uncertainty are <SUP>28</SUP>Si, <SUP>33,34</SUP>S, <SUP>35,37</SUP>Cl, and <SUP>36</SUP>Ar, with relative abundance changes at the level of only 3% to 4%., The distribution of Fe on the martian surface suggests that the planet's climate transitioned to a bipolar state during the Noachian period, likely driven by atmospheric oxidation., In this paper, we present charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions and slowly rotating charged solutions in bumblebee gravity with and without a cosmological constant. The static spherically symmetric solutions describe the Reissner-Nordström-like black hole and ReissnerNordström-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole, while the stationary and axially symmetric soltuions describe Kerr-Newman-like black hole and Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole. We utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to study the shadows of the black holes. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the electric charge and Lorentz-violating parameters on the radius of the shadow reference circle and the distortion parameter. We find that the radius of the reference circle decreases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and charge parameter, while the distortion parameter increases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and the charge parameter., We utilize methane clumped isotopes to explore methane production and consumption in the deep biosphere. Through the Ocean Drilling Programs, we obtained invaluable methane samples, facilitating our ability to establish interplanetary biosignatures., The Tianwen-1 Zhurong rover landed at Utopia Planitia in May 2021 and started to explore the geological processes in the region. A large amount of transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) bedforms exist at the landing area.., GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long burst, GRB 231205B, at 2023-12-05T16:43:34.100 UTC (T0), which was also observed by Swift/BAT (GCN #35269) . According to the realtime alert data, the GECAM-B light curve shows roughly two peaks with a total duration of ~40 sec (15-1050 keV). The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-B realtime data from about T0 to T0+4 s could be adequately fit by a Band function with a fluence about 8.20E-7 erg/cm^2 in 20-1000 keV. The GECAM light curve could be found here: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/GRB231205B_LC.png GECAM location is consistent with that of Swift/BAT within the error. We note that these results are based on realtime alert data and thus very preliminary. Refined analysis will be reported later. Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor(GECAM) mission originally consists of two microsatellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) launched in Dec. 2020. As the third member of GECAM constellation, GECAM-C was launched onboard SATech-01 experimental satellite in July 2022. GECAM mission is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)., There is a typo in our previous report (GCN 35283). Here we make the correction: The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-B realtime data from about T0-0.1 s to T0 could be adequately fit by a cut-off power-law with an average flux of about 6.04E-6 erg/cm^2/s in 20-1000 keV. We are very sorry for any inconvenience., GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a short burst, GRB 231206A, at 2023-12-06T02:37:43.250 UTC (T0), which was also observed by INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS . According to the realtime alert data, the GECAM-B light curve shows a peak with a total duration of ~0.5 sec (15-1050 keV). The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-B realtime data from about T0 to T0+0.1 s could be adequately fit by a cut-off power-law with a fluence about 6.04E-6 erg/cm^2 in 20-1000 keV. Using the automatic in-flight localization pipeline with the realtime alert data, GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): RA: 313.15 deg DEC: -23.54 deg Err: 8.0 deg (1-sigma, statistical only) The systematic error of this location is estimated to be several degrees. The GECAM light curve could be found here: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/GRB231206A_LC.png We note that these results are based on realtime alert data and thus very preliminary.

GECAM mission is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)., Light quark matter (i.e. udQM) comprised of up and down quarks might be stable with respect to nuclear matter and strange quark matter. In this work we investigate the stability of nuggets made of such types of matter, which shows that udQM nuggets at certain sizes are more stable than others if a large symmetry energy is adopted. In such cases, there may be compact dwarfs comprised entirely of udQM nuggets and electrons, i.e., udQM dwarfs. We then examine the structure of such udQM dwarfs and consider their possibility of being covered by normal matter crusts. It is found that udQM dwarfs typically have smaller radii and those covered by normal matter can explain the recently observed white dwarfs with unusually small radii., A large amount of transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) bedforms exist in the Zhurong rover landing region. The acquisition of high-resolution data from the orbiter and the rover from Tianwen-1 mission provides an excellent opportunity to study the geological characteristics of TARs. The length, width, and density of a total of 8,274 TAR samples at the landing site were analyzed. The orientation of TARs at the landing region is dominated in the E-W direction. Analysis of Mars Climate Station (MCS) data on the Zhurong rover shows that the present-day wind direction is inconsistent with the wind forces that promoted the formation of TARs, suggesting that the formation of TARs is dependent on the ancient wind direction. With the help of the Zhurong MarSCoDe shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrometer data, we investigate the composition of materials including TARs, soil, and rocks, and the results show that their spectra display similar distinct absorptions consistent with the presence of hydrated minerals such as hydrated sulfates. The cemented and dusty crust covering the TARs indicates that the TARs have not migrated for a period of time in the landing site area. Some of the TARs have been eroded into small sand ridges or ripples due to the change in the prevailing wind directions, which may indicate the climate change on Mars., In response to the problem that ground-based optical monitoring systems cannot monitor near-Earth asteroids which are too close to the Sun on the celestial sphere, we raise a method that tracks and determines the orbit of asteroids by Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) platforms with optical monitoring. Through data filtering by visibility analysis and the initial orbit information of the asteroids provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the asteroids' orbits are determined and compared with the reference orbit. Simulation results show that with a measurement accuracy of two arcseconds and an arc length of three years, the orbit determination accuracy of the DRO platform for near-Earth asteroids selected in the simulation example can reach tens of kilometers, especially the asteroids with Atira orbits to an accuracy of fewer than ten kilometers. In conclusion, the near-Earth asteroids monitoring systems based on DRO platforms are capable to provide sufficient monitoring effectiveness which enables precise tracking of the target asteroids and forecast of their positions., The Rosette Nebula is a young stellar cluster and molecular cloud complex, located at the edge of the southern shell of a middle-aged supernova remnant Monoceros Loop (G205.5+0.5). We revisited the GeV gamma-ray emission towards the Rosette Nebula using more than 13 yr of Fermi-LAT data. We tested several spatial models and found that compared to the result using the CO gas template only, the inclusion of the H II gas template can significantly improve the likelihood fit. We performed spectral analysis using the new spatial template. With both the gamma-ray observation and CO+H II gas data, we derived the cosmic ray spectrum of different components in the vicinity of the Rosette Nebula. We found the gamma-ray emissions from Rosette Nebula are substantially harder than previously reported, which may imply that Rosette Nebula is another example of a gamma-ray emitting young massive star cluster., Gale crater records the evolution of past climate and redox state of surface and atmosphere on early Mars and perhaps other rocky planets., Embedded Region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents (FACs), intense FAC layers of mesoscale latitudinal width near the interface between large-scale Region 1 and Region 2 FACs, are related to dramatic phenomena in the ionosphere such as discrete arcs, inverted-V precipitation, and dawnside auroral polarization streams. These relationships suggest that the embedded FACs are potentially important for understanding ionospheric heating and magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling and instabilities. Previous case studies of embedded FACs have led to the speculation that they may result from enhanced M-I convection during active times. To explore this idea further, we investigate statistically their occurrence rates under a variety of geomagnetic conditions with a large event list constructed from 17 years of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program observations. The identification procedure is fully automated and explicit. The statistical results indicate that embedded Region 1 and 2 FACs are common, and that they have a higher chance to occur when the level of geomagnetic activity is higher (given by various indices), supporting the idea that they result from enhanced M-I convection., During the commissioning phase, HEBS detected the prompt emission of the extraordinarily bright burst GRB 221009A, which was also observed by Fermi/GBM (Lesage et al., GCN 32642, Veres et al., GCN 32636), Swift/BAT (Dichiara et al., GCN 32632, Kennea et al., GCN 32635) Insight-HXMT/HE (Tan et al., Atel 15660), Fermi/LAT (Bissaldi et al. GCN 32637, Pillera et al., GCN 32658), AGILE/MCAL (Ursi et al., GCN 32650), AGILE/GRID (Piano et al. GCN 32657), INTEGRAL SPI/ACS (Gotz et al., GCN 32660), Konus-Wind (Frederiks et al., GCN 32668), SIRI-2 (Mitchell et al., GCN 32746), and LHAASO (Huang et al., GCN 32677). At the beginning of the burst (2022-10-09T13:17:00.050 UTC, denoted as T0), HEBS was in the high latitude region where the in-flight triggering of HEBS was disabled to eliminate false triggers caused by particle background. However, one gamma-ray detector (i.e. GRD01) and one charged particle detector (i.e. CPD02) are set to collect data normally during this region. The full burst of GRB 221009A prompt emission was well monitored by HEBS. The incident angle to GRD01 is about 70 deg during the prompt emission. Despite of the extreme brightness, the GRB 221009A main burst (T0+180s to T0+270s) was clearly observed by HEBS without data saturation. The dead-time is reasonable and the pulse pileup effect is negligible for the low gain readout channel of GRD01. The dead-time corrected light curves of HEBS could be found at: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/HEBS-GRB221009A.png From the 50 ms light curve, we note that there are complicated spiky structures during the main peaks. All results above are preliminary. Refined analysis is ongoing and will be reported later. HEBS is an all-sky monitor for gamma-ray transients in 10 keV to 5 MeV aboard the Space advanced technology demonstration satellite (SATech-01) satellite, which is funded and built by Chinese academic of sciences, and was launched on July 27, 2022. Both the payload and the science operation of HEBS are inherited from GECAM mission (made of two mini-satellites, GECAM-A and GECAM-B), and thereafter HEBS is also called GECAM-C., , Trace amounts of water in the sub-oceanic mantle play crucial role in the vigor of mantle convection and the production of oceanic crust, and other many geodynamic processes. Consequently, the cycling of H<SUB>2</SUB>O between the mantle and the exosphere in the mantle is one of the critical processes governing Earth's geodynamical and geochemical evolution. While the deep cycling of altered oceanic lithosphere was considered as the main way to replenish the water in oceanic upper mantle, the significance of the arc mantle wedge after the genesis of arc magmatism dragged down by the subducting slab concomitantly has been not well constrained. Here, we report that fresh depleted basaltic glasses from the ultraslow-spreading Southwestern Indian Ridge (SWIR), located far from any recent subduction zones, show unusually high H<SUB>2</SUB>O/Ce ratios (&gt;600), water contents and heavy hydrogen isotopic compositions. These results could be best explained by recycling of water through melting of a residual hydrous mantle wedge after early melt extraction. Considering that such mantle wedges residue dragged down to the deeper mantle could occupy a volume one order of magnitude larger than that of the subducted lithosphere in the earth history, we suggest that the potential role of such shallow recycling should be considered in studies of global water recycling and the origin of water in the upper asthenosphere., The reflectance spectroscopy and mineralogy of Fe-rich chlorite and serpentine are characterized. Spectral proxy is linked to their crystal-chemistry., , We investigate a concrete scenario of a light scalar with a mass around 1 MeV which can be connected to the origin of neutrino masses and simultaneously survive current bounds on relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe. A feeble coupling to the Standard Model neutrinos can relax stringent bounds on the decays to photons inferred from the measured value of N<SUB>eff</SUB>. Interestingly, we find that such a scalar whose diphoton coupling is generated by a tree-level coupling to the muon of similar strength as that of the Standard Model Higgs boson can simultaneously explain the longstanding discrepancy in the measured value of the muon magnetic moment. We present a possible ultraviolet (UV) completion of this scenario providing a link between new physics in the early universe and the generation of neutrino masses., The weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) have been the most popular particle dark matter (DM) candidate for the last several decades, and it is well known that WIMP can be probed via the direct, indirect and collider experiments. However, the direct and indirect signals are highly suppressed in some scalar-mediated DM models, e.g. the lepton portal model with a Majorana DM candidate. As a result, collider searches are considered as the only hope to probe such models. In this white paper, we propose that the gravitational wave (GW) astronomy also serves as a powerful tool to probe such scalar mediated WIMP models via the potential first-order phase transition GW signals. An example for the lepton portal dark matter is provided, showing the complementarity between collider and GW probes., During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long burst, GRB 220124A, at 2022-01-24T03:37:38.200 UTC (denoted as T0), which was also observed by CALET/GBM(triggerID: 1327030648), AstroSAT/CZTI(GCN #31521). GECAM alert data was downlinked to the ground through the short message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) within ~60 s after T0. According to the BDS alert data, this burst mainly consists of multiple pulses with a duration of about 240 s. The GECAM light curve could be found here: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/GRB220124ALC_.png.png Using the automatic on-ground localization pipeline with the BDS alert data, GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): Ra: 246.18 deg Dec: 42.29 deg Err: 2.96 deg (1-sigma, statistical only) The current systematic error of location is estimated to be several degrees which could be minimized by the ongoing calibration.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time), which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)., Nominally anhydrous minerals (NAM) such as olivine are important reservoirs for water in the Earth's upper mantle, although the association of water with crystallographic defects is poorly understood. Here, hydrated regions at the atomic scale in fayalite (Fe<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB>) are directly resolved using atom probe tomography. Site-specific analyses reveal regions that are either compositionally homogenous or contain nanometer-long channels that are consistent with hydrated defects. Na as a minor element is also enriched within the interlayers, indicating the formation environment is associated with Na geochemically. The ability to directly visualize and characterize hydrated regions at the nanometer scale can provide critical insight into the material properties of NAM and their impact on planetary-scale processes, such as the influence of water-bearing minerals on mantle rheology and geodynamics., In modern microwave and optical communication systems, it is urgent to develop optical components with the same performance as electronic components. In this paper, a PT-symmetric structure including electro-optical medium is designed to construct optical triode. It is found that the structure has a pole effect of amplification under certain parameters. The frequency of the incident wave at the pole is taken as the carrier frequency, and the electrical signal is modulated into an optical signal. By setting the bias electric field, the modulated optical signal can be amplified in phase and out phase, and even by doubling frequency, and a new optical triode model is obtained. The designed model will play an important role in the design of optical integrated devices., We have observed LB-1 at regular intervals (28 epochs) since November 2019 (Table 1), with the ""Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs"" (CARMENES) mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. The CARMENES instrument consists of two separate spectrographs covering the wavelength ranges from 0.52 to 0.96um and from 0.96-1.71um with R~80000-100000. <P />(3 data files)., During the commissioning phase, GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long bright burst, GRB 211102B, at 2021-11-02T14:05:35.350 UTC (denoted as T0), which is also observed by Fermi/GBM (GCN #31033).

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) mission consists of two small satellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) in Low Earth Orbit (600 km, 29 deg), launched on Dec 10, 2020 (Beijing Time), which was funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)., In order to fully explore the Taurus region, we use a large searching area: 55°&lt;=RA&lt;=90° and 10°&lt;=DEC&lt;=35°. <P />The spectroscopic data used in this work are taken from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. LAMOST is a 4m Schmidt telescope of the National Astronomical Observatories of China, located at Xinglong Observing Station, China. In this work, we use the LAMOST DR5 data set. <P />In order to construct the spectral energy distribution of each source and estimate its extinction, we used optical photometry in the g, r, i, z, and y bands from Pan-STARRS (Cat. II/349) and G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> bands from Gaia DR2 (Cat. I/345), near-infrared photometry in the J, H, and K<SUB>S</SUB> bands from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; see Cat. II/246), and near- and mid-infrared photometry in the W1 (3.4um), W2 (4.6um), W3 (12um), and W4 (22um) bands from the WISE (see Cat. II/311) all-sky survey. <P />(2 data files)., Examining the inner structure of lunar basins reveals that oblique impact can enough explain the anomaly ellipse structures of SPA without other conditions. Alternatively, the annular structures and impact direction of SPA are prosed., , We identify globally distributed paleosols with strong Fe loss using new spectral indices based on basic chemical processes during weathering. It suggests that anoxic chemical weathering under reducing greenhouse on early Mars., Reduced greenhouse gases such as methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) and hydrogen (H<SUB>2</SUB>) might be the only tenable solution to explain warming of the ancient Martian climate, but direct geological evidence that a reduced atmosphere actually existed on Mars has been lacking. Here we report widespread, strong Fe loss in chemically weathered bedrock sections in the Mawrth Vallis region and other 3-4-billion-year-old terrains on Mars. The separation of Fe from Al in Martian palaeosols, which is comparable to trends observed in palaeosols before the Great Oxidation Event on Earth, suggests that the ancient Martian surface was chemically weathered under a reducing greenhouse atmosphere. Although for different reasons than on Earth, Mars underwent an oxidation event of its own in the late Noachian that forever changed the geological path of the planet., At 2021-01-24T13:23:48.400 (T0), Insight-HXMT/HE detected GRB 210124B (trigger ID: HEB210124558) in a routine search of the data. The Insight-HXMT/HE light curve mainly consists of multiple pulses with a duration (T90) of 0.062 s measured from T0+0.01 s. The 1-ms peak rate, measured from T0+0.035 s, is 34250 cnts/sec. The total counts from this burst is 988 counts. URL_LC: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/HXMT/GRBList/HEB210124558_lc.jpg All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the GRB mode with the energy range of about 250-3000 keV (deposited energy). Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside of the telescope. Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at: http://www.hxmt.org., The rythmic bright-dark structure, extremely abundant sulfates, and gray crystalline hematite (ferric concretions) in widespread layered sedimentary deposits around ±30° of the equator (equatorial layered deposits, ELDs), make the origin of ELDs one of the most puzzling issues on Mars. The long neglected geochemical effects of seasonal freeze-thaw cycles developed in non-permafrost area on Mars can account for combination of the above strange characteristics of ELDs. The relatively longer seasonal cycles on Mars and the relatively higher temperature in low latitude region are favorabl","['2024MNRAS.535.1526L', '2024MNRAS.tmp.2347L', '2024arXiv240603320L',

Tang+, 2019, J/ApJ/877/12 and Furnkranz+, 2019, J/A+A/624/L11, from clustering analyses of Gaia DR2 sources in 5D (position and proper-motion) space. <P />We measured rotation periods independently from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. <P />(6 data files)., The public, all-sky surveys Gaia and TESS provide the ability to identify new young associations and determine their ages. These associations enable study of planetary evolution by providing new opportunities to discover young exoplanets. A young association was recently identified by Tang et al. and Fürnkranz et al. using astrometry from Gaia (called ""Group-X"" by the former). In this work, we investigate the age and membership of this association, and we validate the exoplanet TOI 2048 b, which was identified to transit a young, late G dwarf in Group-X using photometry from TESS. We first identified new candidate members of Group-X using Gaia EDR3 data. To infer the age of the association, we measured rotation periods for candidate members using TESS data. The clear color-period sequence indicates that the association is the same age as the 300 ± 50 Myr old NGC 3532. We obtained optical spectra for candidate members that show lithium absorption consistent with this young age. Further, we serendipitously identify a new, small association nearby Group-X, which we call MELANGE-2. Lastly, we statistically validate TOI 2048 b, which is a 2.1 ± 0.2 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> radius planet on a 13.8-day orbit around its 300 Myr old host star., The synergy of publicly-available datasets from all-sky surveys enables rapid discovery and characterization, using the Skumanich relations, of new stellar clusters. ""Group X"", a compact cluster with a few hundred members, was recently discovered using data from Gaia and has yet to be fully characterized. We used photometry from TESS and ZTF to independently measure stellar rotation periods for cluster members, which show a clear rotation sequence. We also obtained high resolution optical spectra from McDonald Observatory and measure Li equivalent widths. I will present our measurements and age determination for the cluster, and I will highlight how our team has been using similar methods to determine the ages of young, planet-hosting stars in both known and new young associations., tellrv measures absolute radial velocities for low-resolution NIR spectra. It uses telluric features to provide absolute wavelength calibration, and then cross-correlates with a standard star. Observations of a standard star are included for convenience; the code also requires both the telluric and non-telluric-corrected spectra., Transiting Exoplanet Survey Stallite (TESS) observed TIC257605131 in Sectors 4 and 5, from 2018 October 19 to 2018 December 11. <P />(1 data file)., Young exoplanets can offer insight into the evolution of planetary atmospheres, compositions, and architectures. We present the discovery of the young planetary system TOI 451 (TIC 257605131, Gaia DR2 4844691297067063424). TOI 451 is a member of the 120 Myr old Pisces-Eridanus stream (Psc-Eri). We confirm membership in the stream with its kinematics, its lithium abundance, and the rotation and UV excesses of both TOI 451 and its wide-binary companion, TOI 451 B (itself likely an M-dwarf binary). We identified three candidate planets transiting in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data and followed up the signals with photometry from Spitzer and ground-based telescopes. The system comprises three validated planets at periods of 1.9, 9.2, and 16 days, with radii of 1.9, 3.1, and 4.1 R<SUB>⨂</SUB>, respectively. The host star is near-solar mass with V = 11.0 and H = 9.3 and displays an infrared excess indicative of a debris disk. The planets offer excellent prospects for transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, providing the opportunity to study planetary atmospheres that may still be in the process of evolving. <SUP>*</SUP> Sometimes called Meingast-1., Young exoplanets are snapshots of the planetary evolution process. Planets that orbit stars in young associations are particularly important because the age of the planetary system is well constrained. We present the discovery of a transiting planet larger than Neptune but smaller than Saturn in the 45 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving group. The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A (HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra from Southern Astrophysical Research/Goodman, South African Extremely Large Telescope/High Resolution Spectrograph and Las Cumbres Observatories/Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs; transit photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager. No additional stellar or planetary signals are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that the planetary radius is 5.70 ± 0.17 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> and that the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host star’s spin axis, the planet’s orbital axis, and the visual binary’s orbital axis are aligned within 15° to within the uncertainties of the relevant data. DS Tuc Ab is bright enough (V = 8.5) for detailed characterization using radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy., Two planets around the pre-main sequence M dwarf AU Mic have recently been detected, including the hot, 6 Earth radius AU Mic b. AU Mic thus joins the small number of known young planetary systems, and the even smaller number of planets that co-exist with debris disks. AU Mic b is the only planet in a young stellar association with both a mass and a radius, and AU Mic is a bright, nearby, and extremely well-observed host star. We propose to take advantage of the unique opportunities available with HST to conduct a multi-pronged investigation into the atmosphere of AU Mic b. First, we will constrain its atmospheric composition through WFC3 transmission spectroscopy. With transmission spectroscopy with both the G102 and G141 grisms, we can probe both H2O and CH4 features. We can then constrain the C/O ratio and thus where the planet formed. Second, we will probe atmospheric escape through STIS UV transit observations. Using the E140M grating, we will obtain high resolution UV spectra and can search for signatures of atmospheric outflows in Ly-alpha and C II. AU Mic b thus provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate planet formation and evolution., , The MEarth Project is an all-sky survey of approximately 3000 nearby, predominantly mid-to-late M dwarfs (Berta et al. 2012AJ....144..145B; Irwin et al. 2015csss...18..767I). Like MEarth-North, MEarth-South comprises eight 40 cm telescopes on German Equatorial Mounts, equipped with CCD cameras. These telescopes are housed in a roll-off roof at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. Exposure times are set independently for each star based on the S/N required to detect small planets. We use a maximum exposure time of 75 s, so this S/N is achieved by coadding individual exposures. Multiple exposures are also obtained for bright targets in order to average over scintillation noise. We term one set of coadded exposures a visit. There are typically between 1 and 25 visits per night, per target. The MEarth-South survey is ongoing; the analysis presented here uses data obtained prior to BJD 2458179.5 (12am 2018 March 2 UT). We analyze data from 574 stars from MEarth-South. <P />(1 data file)., M dwarf stars, which comprise about 70% of stars in the Solar Neighborhood, are among the most exciting targets for exoplanet surveys. Due to their small sizes, they provide the opportunity for the discovery of small, rocky planets whose masses can be measured and whose atmospheres can be studied in detail. Ground-based surveys, such as those conducted with Keck, HARPS, MEarth, and TRAPPIST, have surveyed many of these nearby M dwarfs in the hunt for new worlds. They have recently been joined by TESS, which began science operations in July 2018. These surveys have yielded a number of exoplanet discoveries that have been subject to intense follow-up efforts, including Gl 436, GJ 1214, TRAPPIST-1, and LHS 1140. Constraining the parameters of the host stars is key to the detailed characterization of these planets. We can infer stellar radii and metallicities from near-infrared spectra and magnetic activity from optical spectra. From photometry, we can determine the stellar rotation period and flare rate. The MEarth Project has dedicated substantial effort to studying nearby M dwarfs using these techniques. I will discuss our observations of nearby M dwarfs, focusing on stellar rotation and metallicity measurements that we have made for low mass stars in the southern hemisphere using MEarth-South and FIRE on Magellan. Our survey is comprised primarily of targets of the MEarth transiting planet survey, and many will soon also be observed by TESS.

Educational programs have been shown to reduce recidivism and increase employment rates (Davis et al., 2016). The Metropolitan College at Boston University operates a prison education program (BUPEP) at Massachusetts state correctional facilities. We developed an introductory astronomy course for BUPEP that utilized active learning strategies and peer instruction. We taught the course twice in a medium security men's prison in which BUPEP has an established community college program. The course, ""Introduction to the Solar System,"" served approximately 20 students each of the two semesters it was taught. In this contribution, we discuss the need for programs such as this, our course structure, and recommendations for future instructors.

Newton under award #1602597, Stellar rotation periods are valuable both for constraining models of angular momentum loss and for understanding how magnetic features impact inferences of exoplanet parameters. Building on our previous work in the northern hemisphere, we have used long-term, ground-based photometric monitoring from the MEarth Observatory to measure 234 rotation periods for nearby, southern hemisphere M dwarfs. Notable examples include the exoplanet hosts GJ 1132, LHS 1140, and Proxima Centauri. We find excellent agreement between our data and K2 photometry for the overlapping subset. Among the sample of stars with the highest quality data sets, we recover periods in 66%; as the length of the data set increases, our recovery rate approaches 100%. The longest rotation periods we detect are around 140 days, which we suggest represent the periods that are reached when M dwarfs are as old as the local thick disk (about 9 Gyr)., Exoplanets in young associations provide an otherwise inaccessible window into how planetary systems form and evolve. We expect to discover 19 young exoplanets around bright stars through our TESS GI programs, which will provide a critical data set for studying planet formation and evolution into the next decade. Here, we propose to obtain transit observations of these young planets with Spitzer. We seek to use Spitzer because it enables us is to obtain precise photometric observations at wavelengths that will also mitigate the impact of stellar activity, which is expected to be high for these young stars. Using data from Spitzer, we will directly address two questions: how do the atmospheres of sub-Neptune sized planets evolve? And what is the mechanism by which planets migrate onto short orbits? We will do this by measuring minimum eccentricities via the photoeccentric effect and by accurately and precisely constraining the planetary properties. We will additionally improve transit ephemerides, ensuring that the transits of these planets are not lost as the community prepares for future observations with JWST, HST, and ground-based facilities. This is a target of opportunity program., M dwarf stars are the most common type of star in the galaxy, but their ages are challenging to determine due to their trillion-year lifetimes on the main sequence. Consequently, the evolution of rotation and magnetism at field ages is difficult to investigate observationally. M dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood provide a unique opportunity to make progress in this area due to the availability of parallaxes and the accessibility of spectroscopy. We have used new rotation period measurements and our compilation of H-alpha emission for nearby M dwarfs to explore two questions: 1) What is the longest rotation period an M dwarf can have? And 2) Do M dwarfs undergo an era of rapid angular momentum evolution? Here, we focus on the view from the Southern hemisphere, presenting approximately 200 new rotation periods for fully convective M dwarfs. Amongst the highest-quality datasets, we identify rotation periods in three-quarters of all stars; of these, half have rotation periods longer than 70 days. The longest rotation period we detect is 148 days, which is for a 0.15 solar-mass star. The lack of M dwarfs with intermediate rotation periods that we previously identified persists, supporting our hypothesis that M dwarfs rapidly spin down from 10-day to 100-day periods.ERN is supported by the National Science Foundation Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship. We gratefully acknowledge support from the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the John Templeton Foundation., Our sample of M dwarfs is drawn from the MEarth Project, an all-sky survey looking for transiting planets around approximately 3000 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs. Nutzman &amp; Charbonneau (2008PASP..120..317N) selected the northern MEarth targets from the Lepine &amp; Shara (2005, I/298) northern proper motion catalog (hereafter the ""nearby northern M dwarf"" sample). <P />MEarth-North is located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO), on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and has been operational since 2008 September. The observatory comprises eight 40cm telescopes. This work utilizes results from MEarth-North and from our further spectroscopic characterization of the sample. Compiled and new rotation period and Hα measurements are included in Table 1. <P />(1 data file)., Understanding stellar rotation and magnetic activity is critical to both the detection and characterization of exoplanets. This is particularly pertinent for planets around M dwarf stars, which remain magnetically active for Gyrs and for which the habitable zone is at only a few tenths of an AU. While these low-mass stars are the most common type of star in the galaxy, a lack of observational constraints at ages beyond 1 Gyr has hampered studies of rotational evolution and magnetic activity. To address this, we have made new measurements of rotation and magnetic activity in nearby, field-age M dwarfs. Our rotation period measurements are derived from photometry from the MEarth planet-search data, and include detections from 0.1 to 140 days. Using galactic kinematics as a proxy for age, we find that mid M dwarfs in the field are slowly-rotating, with periods of approximately 100 days at 5 Gyr. We combine our 387 rotation period measurements and 247 new optical spectra with data from the literature. We confirm that the activity of rapidly rotating M dwarfs maintains a saturated value and our data show a clear power-law decay in relative H-alpha luminosity as a function Rossby number. I will discuss planet-hosting M dwarfs in the context of the relationship between age, rotation, and activity., Main sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35 solar masses are fully-convective, and are expected to have a different type of magnetic dynamo than solar-type stars. Observationally, the dynamo mechanism can be probed through the relationship between rotation and magnetic activity, and the evolution of these properties. Though M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the galaxy, a lack of observational constraints at ages beyond 1 Gyr has hampered studies of the rotation-activity relation. To address this, we have made new measurements of rotation and magnetic activity in nearby, field-age M dwarfs. Combining our 386 rotation period measurements and 247 new optical spectra with data from the literature, we are able to probe the rotation-activity in M dwarfs with masses from 0.1 to 0.6 solar masses. We observe a threshold in the mass--period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. We confirm that the activity of rapidly rotating M dwarfs maintains a saturated value. We have measured rotation periods as long as 140 days, allowing us to probe the unsaturated regime in detail. Our data show a clear power-law decay in relative H-alpha luminosity as a function Rossby number. We discuss implications for the magnetic dynamo mechanism.We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship for Science and Engineering, and the John Templeton Foundation. E.R.N. acknowledges support from the NSF through a Graduate Research Fellowship and an Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship., The high-energy emission from low-mass stars is mediated by the magnetic dynamo. Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate large-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for solar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new optical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our observations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202 measurements or non-detections of Hα emission in nearby M dwarfs. This includes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow rotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. The well-defined active/inactive boundary indicates that Hα activity is a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g., for target selection for exoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs. We also find a significant, moderate correlation between L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> and variability amplitude: more active stars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with previous work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>. Our data also show a clear power-law decay in L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> with Rossby number for slow rotators, with an index of -1.7 ± 0.1., Despite the prevalence of fully-convective stars, very few members of the field population have measured rotation periods. The lack of observational constraints at field ages has hampered studies of rotational evolution. We present rotation periods for 387 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs in the Northern hemisphere, including detections from 0.1 to 140 days. The period distribution is mass dependent: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a dearth of stars with intermediate rotation periods, which suggests that fully-convective stars undergo rapid angular momentum evolution. The typical detected rotator has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5 to 1%. We find no correlation between period and amplitude for stars below 0.25 M<SUB>sun</SUB>. We use Galactic kinematics and established age-velocity relations to estimate the M dwarf spin-down timescale. We find that stars with P&lt;10 days are on average &lt;2 Gyrs, and that those with P&gt;70 days are about 5 Gyrs. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which the era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. Our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of LHα/Lbol, and that for slow rotators there is a power-law decay in LHα/Lbol with Rossby number., In this work, we extend the analysis of Irwin et al. (2011ApJ...727...56I) to the full northern sample of M dwarfs observed by MEarth. MEarth-North is located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and has been operational since 2008 September. See section 2 for further explanations. <P />(1 data file)., Young planetary systems offer the opportunity to study the early stages of planetary and atmospheric evolution. Exoplanets in young stellar clusters, which have known ages, provide a valuable benchmark for models of these processes. K2-25b is a Neptune-sized exoplanet recently found to transit a mid M dwarf member of the Hyades open cluster (625 Myr from isochrone fitting). Atmospheric escape is thought to play an important role in sculpting the final compositions of low-mass planets like K2-25b. At 3.7 Earth-radii, K2-25b may represent the puffy precursor to the close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes found around older mid M dwarfs. This star's youth, proximity and high levels of activity offer a unique opportunity to study atmospheric evaporation. We propose to observe two transits of K2-25b at Lyman alpha wavelengths in order to determine the size of the planetary exosphere. We have simulated the expected Lyman alpha spectrum of this star using representative a stellar profile and interstellar absorption, and considered the intrinsic stellar variability. We estimate that we will obain a S/N of 14.7 in the integrated flux in the blue wing of the Lyman alpha line, where the transit signal is expected. A 50% Lyman alpha transit depth was recently observed for Gl 436b, which is a Neptune-sized planet in orbit around an old, inactive M dwarf. Our observations will result in a 10.6 sigma detection of the planetary exosphere if the transit is the same depth as for Gl 436b., Stellar activity and rotation frustrate the detection of exoplanets through the radial velocity technique. This effect is particularly of concern for M dwarfs, which can remain magnetically active for billions of years. We compile rotation periods for late-type stars and for the M dwarf planet-host sample in order to investigate the rotation periods of older field stars across the main sequence. We show that for stars with masses between 0.25 and 0.5 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> (M4V-M1V), the stellar rotation period typical of field stars coincides with the orbital periods of planets in the habitable zone. This will pose a fundamental challenge to the discovery and characterization of potentially habitable planets around early M dwarfs. Due to the longer rotation periods reached by mid M dwarfs and the shorter orbital period at which the planetary habitable zone is found, stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.25 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> (M6V-M4V) offer better opportunities for the detection of habitable planets via radial velocities., Rotation is a directly observable stellar property, and it drives magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5%-1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> and an anticorrelation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older, slowly rotating stars without Hα emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. We use parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, photometry, and near-infrared metallicity estimates to further characterize the population of rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the solar neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity relations to estimate that stars with P &lt; 10 days have ages of on average &lt;2 Gyr, and that those with P &gt; 70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr. The period distribution is dependent on mass: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack of stars with intermediate rotation periods, and the gap between the fast and slow rotators is larger for lower masses. Our data are consistent with a scenario in which these stars maintain rapid rotation for several gigayears, then spin down quickly, reaching periods of around 100 days by a typical age of 5 Gyr., Despite the prevalence of M dwarfs, their fundamental properties--their sizes, compositions, and ages--are not well-constrained. Empirical determination of these properties is important for gaining insight into their stellar structure, magnetic field generation, and angular momentum evolution. Knowledge of the stellar parameters is also key to characterizing planetary systems. I used observations to empirically constrain the properties of nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs targeted by the MEarth transiting planet survey. I obtained low-resolution (R=2000) NIR spectra of 450 M dwarfs using SpeX on IRTF. I measured their absolute radial velocities with an accuracy of 4 km/s by exploiting telluric lines to establish an absolute wavelength calibration, and developed techniques to estimate M dwarf metallicities from K-band spectral line equivalent widths (EWs) or 2MASS colors to 0.15 dex. Using stars with interferometric radii, I showed that H-band EWs can be used to infer K and M dwarf temperatures to 69K, and radii to 0.027Rsun. I applied these relations to planet-hosting stars from Kepler, showing that the typical planet is 15% larger than is inferred if adopting other stellar parameters. Using photometry from the MEarth-North Observatory, I measured rotation periods from 0.1 to 150 days for 350 M dwarfs. There is a prevalence of stable spot patterns, and no correlation between period and amplitude for fully-convective stars. Using galactic kinematics as a proxy for age, I demonstrated a smooth age-rotation relation. I found that rapid rotators (P&lt;10 days) are &lt;2 Gyr, and that the slowest are on average 5+-3 Gyr old. I will discuss the extension of this work to the southern hemisphere, which utilizes FIRE on Magellan and the MEarth-South Observatory.

This work includes observations obtained at the Infrared Telescope Facility, operated by the U. of Hawaii, and the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. I recognize the significant role of Mauna Kea within the indigenous Hawaiian community, and acknowledge the opportunity to conduct these observations., Despite the prevalence of M dwarfs, the smallest and most common type of main sequence star, their sizes, compositions, and ages are not well-constrained. Empirical determination of these properties is important for gaining insight into their stellar structure, magnetic field generation, and angular momentum evolution. I obtained low-resolution (R = 2000) near-infrared spectra of 447 nearby mid-to-late M dwarfs. I measured their absolute radial velocities with an accuracy of 4.4 km/s by exploiting telluric lines to establish an absolute wavelength calibration. I estimated their metallicities from the equivalent width of the sodium absorption feature at 2.2 microm to a precision of 0.12 dex, and from 2MASS colors to a precision of 0.15 dex. Using stars with radii measured from interferometry, I showed that the equivalent widths of aluminum and magnesium absorption features can be used to infer K and M dwarf temperatures to a precision of 69 K, and radii to 0.027 R solar masses. I applied these relations to planet-hosting stars from Kepler, showing that the typical planet is 15% larger than inferred when adopting stellar parameters from other recent catalogs. Using photometry from the MEarth-North Observatory, I measured rotation periods from 0.1 to 140 days for 387 M dwarfs. I found a prevalence of stable spot patterns, and no correlation between period and amplitude for fully-convective stars. Using galactic kinematics as a proxy for age, I found that rapid rotators (P &lt; 10 days) are &lt; 2 Gyr, and that the slowest are on average 5 +/- 3 Gyr old. I then showed that for early M dwarfs the typical stellar rotation period at 5 Gyr coincides with the orbital period at which habitable planets are found, and I suggest that mid-to-late M dwarfs are optimal targets around which to search for habitable-zone planets. I obtained optical spectra of 247 nearby M dwarfs, and measured the strength of the chromospheric Halpha emission line. I identified a well-defined boundary in the mass-period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. Halpha activity is therefore a simple, accessible diagnostic for stellar rotation period, and I present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs. I found a significant (p value &lt; 10-4) positive correlation between Halpha emission strength and photometric variability amplitude, which implies that stars with stronger magnetic fields have both higher levels of chromospheric activity and larger or more abundant spots. I suggest that fully convective stars maintain rapid rotation rates and saturated magnetic activity for about 2 Gyr. They then undergo rapid angular momentum evolution upon reaching some critical threshold. Only upon reaching long rotation periods (around 70 days for a 0.2 Msolar masses star) do their magnetic activity levels drop below what is required for Halpha to be seen in emission. The stars I have observed in pursuit of this work are the nearest low-mass stars. As such they are the best targets around which to search for habitable, rocky worlds, and my work provides the means to constrain the sizes, temperatures, and ages of those planets., Field stars provide important constraints for the late stages of stars' angular momentum evolution. We measured rotation periods ranging from 0.1 to 150 days for approximately 450 mid-to-late M dwarfs using photometry from the MEarth transiting planet survey. We use parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities to calculate galactic kinematics for these solar neighborhood M dwarfs. The velocity dispersions increase towards longer rotation periods, indicating that there is a relationship between rotation and age for these stars., Stellar rotation and its associated activity signals can mimic the radial velocity signa","['10.3847/1538-3881/acb589', '2023AJ....165..136N', '2022yCat..51640115N', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51640115', '10.48550/arXiv.2206.06254', '10.3847/1538-3881/ac8154', '2022AJ....164..115N', 'arXiv:2206.06254', '2022arXiv220606254N', '2022fysr.confE..13N', 'ascl:2201.007', '2022ascl.soft01007N', '2021yCat..51610065N', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51610065', 'arXiv:2102.06049', '2021arXiv210206049N', '10.48550/arXiv.2102.06049', '2021AJ....161...65N', '10.3847/1538-3881/abccc6', '2019ApJ...880L..17N', '10.48550/arXiv.1906.10703', 'arXiv:1906.10703', '2019arXiv190610703N', '10.3847/2041-8213/ab2988', '2019hst..prop15836N', '2019psce.confE..14N', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51560217', '2019yCat..51560217N', '2019AAS...23310301N', '2019AAS...23325704N', '10.3847/1538-3881/aad73b', '10.48550/arXiv.1807.09365', '2018arXiv180709365N', 'arXiv:1807.09365', '2018AJ....156..217N', '2018sptz.prop14011N', '2018AAS...23133402N', '2017yCat..18340085N', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18340085', '2017reph.conf10102N', '2017AAS...22913103N', 'arXiv:1611.03509', '2017ApJ...834...85N', '10.48550/arXiv.1611.03509', '2016arXiv161103509N', '10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/85', '10.5281/zenodo.153997', '2016csss.confE...4N', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18210093', '2016yCat..18210093N', '2016hst..prop14615N', '2016ApJ...821L..19N', '10.48550/arXiv.1604.03135', 'arXiv:1604.03135', '10.3847/2041-8205/821/1/L19', '2016arXiv160403135N', '10.48550/arXiv.1511.00957', '10.3847/0004-637X/821/2/93', 'arXiv:1511.00957', '2016ApJ...821...93N', '2015arXiv151100957N', '2016AAS...22710505N', '2016PhDT........96N', '2016PhDT.......125N', '2016IAUS..314..124N', '2015IAUS..314..124N', '10.1017/S174392131500602X', '2015ESS.....311203N', '10.48550/arXiv.1412.2758', 'arXiv:1412.2758', '10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/85', '2015ApJ...800...85N', '2014arXiv1412.2758N', '2015AAS...22513817N', '2014AAS...22440403N', '2014AAS...22321506N', '2013arXiv1310.1087N', '10.48550/arXiv.1310.1087', '2014AJ....147...20N', 'arXiv:1310.1087', '10.1088/0004-6256/147/1/20', '2013prpl.conf1K093N', '2012AAS...21914701N', '2012AAS...21931303N', '2011ESS.....2.4403N', '2011ApJ...734..104N', '10.48550/arXiv.1104.2608', 'arXiv:1104.2608', '2011arXiv1104.2608N', '10.1088/0004-637X/734/2/104', '2011AAS...21832608N', '2011BAAS..43G32608N', '2011BAAS...4334705N', '2011AAS...21734705N', '10.48550/arXiv.0810.3934', '10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1125', '2008arXiv0810.3934N', 'arXiv:0810.3934', '2009ApJ...696.1125N']","[('dwarf', 116), ('star', 110), ('period', 87), ('rotation', 80), ('planet', 70), ('mass', 51), ('survey', 49), ('mearth', 48), ('stellar', 44), ('data', 36)]","[(('rotation', 'period'), 53), (('radial', 'velocity'), 21), (('late', 'dwarf'), 19), (('mid', 'late'), 18), (('transiting', 'planet'), 16), (('planet', 'survey'), 16), (('type', 'star'), 14), (('stellar', 'rotation'), 13), (('fully', 'convective'), 11), (('nir', 'spectral'), 11)]","[(('mid', 'late', 'dwarfs'), 18), (('transiting', 'planet', 'survey'), 13), (('national', 'science', 'foundation'), 10), (('measured', 'rotation', 'periods'), 9), (('low', 'mass', 'stars'), 8), (('fully', 'convective', 'stars'), 7), (('mearth', 'transiting', 'planet'), 6), (('angular', 'momentum', 'evolution'), 6), (('nir', 'spectral', 'types'), 6), (('absolute', 'wavelength', 'calibration'), 5)]",Dirty

Dr., Rochester, NY, 14623, USA, Rochester Institute of Technology (United States), -","Directly imaging Earth-sized exoplanets with a visible-light coronagraph instrument on a space telescope will require a system that can achieve approximately 10<SUP>−10</SUP> raw contrast and maintain it for the duration of observations (on the order of hours or more). We are designing, manufacturing, and testing Dual Purpose Lyot coronagraph (DPLC) masks that allow for simultaneous wavefront sensing and control using out-of-band light to maintain high contrast in the science focal plane. Our initial design uses a tiered metallic focal plane occultor to suppress starlight in the transmitted coronagraph channel and a dichroic-coated substrate to reflect out-of-band light to a wavefront sensing camera. The occultor design introduces a phase shift such that the reflected channel is a Zernike wavefront sensor. The dichroic coating allows higher-order wavefront errors to be detected which is especially critical for compensating for residual drifts from an actively-controlled segmented primary mirror. A second-generation design concept includes a metasurface to create polarization-dependent phase shifts in the reflected beam, which has several advantages including an extended dynamic range. We will present the focal plane mask designs, characterization, and initial testing at NASA's High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility, The unparalleled theoretical performance of an ideal vector vortex coronagraph makes it one of the most promising technologies for directly imaging exoplanets with a future, off-axis space telescope. However, the image contrast required for observing the light reflected from Earth-sized planets (∼ 10<SUP>−10</SUP>) has yet to be demonstrated in a laboratory setting. With recent advances in the manufacturing of liquid crystal vector vortex waveplates as well as system-level performance improvements on our testbeds, we have achieved raw contrast of 1.57×10<SUP>−9</SUP> and 5.86×10<SUP>−9</SUP> in 10% and 20% optical bandwidths, respectively, averaged over 3-10 λ/D separations on one side of the pseudo-star. The former represents a factor of 10 improvement over the previously reported performance. We will show experimental comparisons of the contrast achieved and a function of spectral bandwidth. We provide estimates of the limiting error terms and discuss the improvements needed to close the gap in contrast performance required for future exoplanet imaging space telescopes., The vector vortex coronagraph is an instrument designed for direct detection and spectroscopy of exoplanets over a broad spectral range. Our team is working towards demonstrating contrast performance commensurate with imaging temperate, terrestrial planets orbiting solar-type stars using the High Contrast Imaging Testbed facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To date, the best broadband performance achieved is ~10-8 raw contrast over a bandwidth of Δλ/λ=10% in the visible regime (central wavelengths of 550 nm-750 nm), while monochromatic tests yield much deeper contrast (~10-9 or better). In this study, we analyze the main performance limitations on the testbeds so far, focusing on the quality of the focal plane mask manufacturing. We measure the polarization properties of the masks and the residual electric field in the dark hole as a function of wavelength. Our results suggest that the current performance is limited by localized defects in the in the focal plane masks. A new generation of masks is under test that have fewer defects and promise performance improvements., Stellar coronagraphs rely on deformable mirrors (DMs) to correct wavefront errors and create high-contrast images. Imperfect control of the DM limits the achievable contrast, and therefore, the DM control electronics must provide fine surface height resolution and low noise. We study the impact of quantization errors due to the DM electronics on the image contrast using experimental data from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We find that the simplest analytical model gives optimistic predictions compared to real cases, with contrast up to 3 times better, which leads to DM surface height resolution requirements that are incorrectly relaxed by 70%. We show that taking into account the DM actuator shape, or influence function, improves the analytical predictions. However, we also find that end-to-end numerical simulations of the wavefront sensing and control process provide the most accurate predictions and recommend such an approach for setting robust requirements on the DM control electronics. From our experimental and numerical results, we conclude that a surface height resolution of ∼6 pm is required for imaging temperate terrestrial exoplanets around solar-type stars at wavelengths as small as 450 nm with coronagraph instruments on future space telescopes. Finally, we list the recognizable characteristics of quantization errors that may help determine if they are a limiting factor., Future space telescopes with coronagraph instruments will use a wavefront sensor (WFS) to measure and correct for phase errors and stabilize the stellar intensity in high-contrast images. The HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts baseline a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), which uses Zernike's phase contrast method to convert phase in the pupil into intensity at the WFS detector. In preparation for these potential future missions, we experimentally demonstrate a ZWFS in a coronagraph instrument on the Decadal Survey Testbed in the High Contrast Imaging Testbed facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We validate that the ZWFS can measure low- and mid-spatial frequency aberrations up to the control limit of the deformable mirror (DM), with surface height sensitivity as small as 1 pm, using a configuration similar to the HabEx and LUVOIR concepts. Furthermore, we demonstrate closed-loop control, resolving an individual DM actuator, with residuals consistent with theoretical models. In addition, we predict the expected performance of a ZWFS on future space telescopes using natural starlight from a variety of spectral types. The most challenging scenarios require ∼1 h of integration time to achieve picometer sensitivity. This timescale may be drastically reduced by using internal or external laser sources for sensing purposes. The experimental results and theoretical predictions presented here advance the WFS technology in the context of the next generation of space telescopes with coronagraph instruments., The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's Decadal Survey Testbed (DST), one of three coronagraph testbeds in the High Contrast Imaging Testbed facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, aims to the demonstrate the coronagraph technologies required to directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets with future NASA space telescopes. Commissioned in early 2019, the DST has become NASA's most sensitive coronagraph testbed with a vacuum environment and high thermal/vibrational stability. We have demonstrated a Lyot coronagraph with two deformable mirrors, a Nickel-on-glass occulting spot, and annular Lyot stop that provide a 360° dark hole between 3 to 9 λ/D at 550 nm using Electric Field Conjugation wavefront control algorithms. The DST coronagraph achieved repeatable convergence below 5e-10 mean raw contrast within a spectral bandwidth of Δλ/λ=0.1. This testbed is now available to all principal investigators awarded openly-competed NASA Strategic Astrophysics Technology grants. In this talk, I will describe the testbed design, raw contrast results in both monochromatic and polychromatic light, empirical testbed stability, current testbed limitations, and plans for future experiments., Vortex fiber nulling (VFN) is a method that may enable the detection and characterization of exoplanets at small angular separations (0.5-2 λ/D) with ground- and space-based telescopes. Since the field of view is within the inner working angle of most coronagraphs, nulling accesses non-transiting planets that are otherwise too close to their star for spectral characterization by other means, thereby significantly increasing the number of known exoplanets available for direct spectroscopy in the near-infrared. Furthermore, VFN targets planets on closer-in orbits which tend to have more favorable planet-to-star flux ratios in reflected light. Here, we present the theory and applications of VFN, show that the optical performance is approximately equivalent for a variety of implementations and aperture shapes, and discuss the trade-offs between throughput and engineering requirements using numerical simulations. We compare vector and scalar approaches and, finally, show that beam shaping optics may be used to significantly improve the throughput for planet light. Based on theoretical performance, we estimate the number of known planets and theoretical exoEarths accessible with a VFN instrument linked to a high-resolution spectrograph on the future Thirty Meter Telescope., Vortex coronagraphs are an attractive solution for imaging exoplanets with future space telescopes due to their relatively high throughput, large spectral bandwidth, and low sensitivity to low-order aberrations compared to other coronagraphs with similar inner working angles. Most of the vortex coronagraph mask development for space applications has focused on generating a polychromatic, vectorial, optical vortex using multiple layers of liquid crystal polymers. While this approach has been the most successful thus far, current fabrication processes achieve retardance errors of 0.1-1.0°, which causes a nonnegligible fraction of the starlight to leak through the coronagraph. Circular polarizers are typically used to reject the stellar leakage reducing the throughput by a factor of two. Vector vortex masks also complicate wavefront control because they imprint conjugated phase ramps on the orthogonal circular polarization components, which may need to be split in order to properly sense and suppress the starlight. Scalar vortex masks can potentially circumvent these limitations by applying the same phase shift to all incident light regardless of the polarization state and thus have the potential to significantly improve the performance of vortex coronagraphs. We present scalar vortex coronagraph designs that make use of focal plane masks with multiple layers of dielectrics that (a) produce phase patterns that are relatively friendly to standard manufacturing processes and (b) achieve sufficient broadband starlight suppression, in theory, for imaging Earth-like planets with future space telescopes., Reference star differential imaging (RDI) is a powerful strategy for high-contrast imaging. Using example observations taken with the vortex coronagraph mode of Keck/NIRC2 in L‧ band, we demonstrate that RDI provides improved sensitivity to point sources at small angular separations compared to angular differential imaging (ADI). Applying RDI to images of the low-mass stellar companions HIP 79124 C (192 mas separation, ΔL‧ = 4.01) and HIP 78233 B (141 mas separation, ΔL‧ = 4.78), the latter a first imaging detection, increases the significance of their detections by up to a factor of 5 with respect to ADI. We compare methods for reference frame selection and find that pre-selection of frames improves detection significance of point sources by up to a factor of 3. In addition, we use observations of the circumstellar disks around MWC 758 and 2MASS J16042165-2130284 to show that RDI allows for accurate mapping of scattered light distributions without self-subtraction artifacts., Instrumentation designed to characterize potentially habitable planets may combine adaptive optics and high-resolution spectroscopy techniques to achieve the highest possible sensitivity to spectral signs of life. Detecting the weak signal from a planet containing biomarkers will require exquisite control of the optical wavefront to maximize the planet signal and significantly reduce unwanted starlight. We present an optical technique, known as vortex fiber nulling (VFN), that allows polychromatic light from faint planets at extremely small separations from their host stars (≲λ/D) to be efficiently routed to a diffraction-limited spectrograph via a single-mode optical fiber, while light from the star is prevented from entering the spectrograph. VFN takes advantage of the spatial selectivity of a single-mode fiber to isolate the light from close-in companions in a small field of view around the star. We provide theoretical performance predictions of a conceptual design and show that VFN may be utilized to characterize planets detected by radial velocity (RV) instruments in the infrared without knowledge of the azimuthal orientation of their orbits. Using a spectral template-matching technique, we calculate an integration time of ∼400, ∼100, and ∼30 hr for Ross 128 b with Keck, the Thirty Meter Telescope, and the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor, respectively., The Optimal Optical Coronagraph (OOC) Workshop at the Lorentz Center in September 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands gathered a diverse group of 25 researchers working on exoplanet instrumentation to stimulate the emergence and sharing of new ideas. In this first installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise., Coronagraph instruments on future space telescopes will enable the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars for the first time. The quest for the optimal optical coronagraph designs has made rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of high-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors to (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diffracted starlight from obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the algorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be computationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys. Here, we utilize the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO), a tool that allows for rapid optimization of deformable mirror shapes, to explore trade-offs in coronagraph designs for obstructed and segmented space telescopes. We compare designs for representative shaped pupil Lyot and vortex coronagraphs, two of the most promising concepts for the LUVOIR space mission concept. We analyze the optical performance of each design, including their throughput and ability to passively suppress light from partially resolved stars in the presence of low-order aberrations. Our main result is that deformable mirror based apodization can suffciently suppress diffraction from support struts and inter-segment gaps whose widths are on the order of 0.1% of the primary mirror diameter to detect Earth-sized planets within a few tens of milliarcseconds from the star., The Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission concept requires an optical coronagraph that provides deep starlight suppression over a broad spectral bandwidth, high throughput for point sources at small angular separation, and insensitivity to temporally varying, low-order aberrations. Vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that performs optimally on off-axis, monolithic telescopes and may also be designed for segmented telescopes with minor losses in performance. We describe the key advantages of vortex coronagraphs on off-axis telescopes such as (1) unwanted diffraction due to aberrations is passively rejected in several low-order Zernike modes relaxing the wavefront stability requirements for imaging Earth-like planets from &lt;10 to &gt;100 pm rms, (2) stars with angular diameters &gt;0.1 λ / D may be sufficiently suppressed, (3) the absolute planet throughput is &gt;10 % , even for unfavorable telescope architectures, and (4) broadband solutions (Δλ / λ &gt; 0.1) are readily available for both monolithic and segmented apertures. The latter make use of grayscale apodizers in an upstream pupil plane to provide suppression of diffracted light from amplitude discontinuities in the telescope pupil without inducing additional stroke on the deformable mirrors. We set wavefront stability requirements on the telescope, based on a stellar irradiance threshold set at an angular separation of 3 ± 0.5λ / D from the star, and discuss how some requirements may be relaxed by trading robustness to aberrations for planet throughput., The segmented coronagraph design and analysis (SCDA) study is a coordinated effort, led by Stuart Shaklan (JPL) and supported by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP), to provide efficient coronagraph design concepts for exoplanet imaging with future segmented aperture space telescopes. This document serves as an update on the apodized vortex coronagraph designs devised by the Caltech/JPL SCDA team. Apodized vortex coronagraphs come in two flavors, where the apodization is achieved either by use of 1) a gray-scale semi-transparent pupil mask or 2) a pair of deformable mirrors in series. Each approach has attractive benefits. This document presents a comprehensive review of the former type. Future theoretical investigations will further explore the use of deformable mirrors for apodization., The detection of molecular species in the atmospheres of earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars requires an optical system that suppresses starlight and maximizes the sensitivity to the weak planet signals at small angular separations. Achieving sufficient contrast performance on a segmented aperture space telescope is particularly challenging due to unwanted diffraction within the telescope from amplitude and phase discontinuities in the pupil. Apodized vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that theoretically meet the performance needs for high contrast imaging with future segmented space telescopes. We investigate the sensitivity of apodized vortex coronagraphs to the expected aberrations, including segment co-phasing errors in piston and tip/tilt as well as other low-order and mid-spatial frequency aberrations. Coronagraph designs and their associated telescope requirements are identified for conceptual HabEx and LUVOIR telescope designs., , Distinct gap features in the nearest protoplanetary disk, TW Hya (distance of 59.5 ± 0.9 pc), may be signposts of ongoing planet formation. We performed long-exposure thermal infrared coronagraphic imaging observations to search for accreting planets, especially within dust gaps previously detected in scattered light and submillimeter-wave thermal emission. Three nights of observations with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in L‧ (3.4-4.1 μm) did not reveal any statistically significant point sources. We thereby set strict upper limits on the masses of non-accreting planets. In the four most prominent disk gaps at 24, 41, 47, and 88 au, we obtain upper mass limits of 1.6-2.3, 1.1-1.6, 1.1-1.5, and 1.0-1.2 Jupiter masses (M <SUB>J</SUB>), assuming an age range of 7-10 Myr for TW Hya. These limits correspond to the contrast at 95% completeness (true positive fraction of 0.95) with a 1% chance of a false positive within 1″ of the star. We also approximate an upper limit on the product of the planet mass and planetary accretion rate of {M}<SUB>{{p</SUB>}}\dot{M}≲ {10}<SUP>-8</SUP> {M}<SUB>{{J</SUB>}}<SUP>2</SUP> {yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP> implying that any putative ∼0.1 M <SUB>J</SUB> planet, which could be responsible for opening the 24 au gap, is presently accreting at rates insufficient to build up a Jupiter mass within TW Hya’s pre-main-sequence lifetime., , , Current state-of-the-art high contrast imaging instruments take advantage of a number of elegant coronagraph designs to suppress starlight and image nearby faint objects, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The ideal performance and complexity of the optical systems depends strongly on the shape of the telescope aperture. Unfortunately, large primary mirrors tend to be segmented and have various obstructions, which limit the performance of most conventional coronagraph designs. We present a new family of vortex coronagraphs with numerically-optimized gray-scale apodizers that provide the sensitivity needed to directly image faint exoplanets with large, segmented aperture telescopes, including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) as well as potential next-generation space telescopes., Phase-only optical elements can provide a number of important functions for high-contrast imaging. This thesis presents analytical and numerical optical design methods for accomplishing specific tasks, the most significant of which is the precise suppression of light from a distant point source. Instruments designed for this purpose are known as coronagraphs. Here, advanced coronagraph designs are presented that offer improved theoretical performance in comparison to the current state-of-the-art. Applications of these systems include the direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disks with high sensitivity. Several new coronagraph designs are introduced and, in some cases, experimental support is provided. In addition, two novel high-contrast imaging applications are discussed: the measurement of sub-resolution information using coronagraphic optics and the protection of sensors from laser damage. The former is based on experimental measurements of the sensitivity of a coronagraph to source displacement. The latter discussion presents the current state of ongoing theoretical work. Beyond the mentioned applications, the main outcome of this thesis is a generalized theory for the design of optical systems with one of more phase masks that provide precise control of radiation over a large dynamic range, which is relevant in various high-contrast imaging scenarios. The optimal phase masks depend on the necessary tasks, the maximum number of optics, and application specific performance measures. The challenges and future prospects of this work are discussed in detail., Context. The vortex coronagraph is an optical instrument that precisely removes on-axis starlight allowing for high contrast imaging at small angular separation from the star, a crucial capability for direct detection and characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Telescopes with aperture obstructions, such as secondary mirrors and spider support structures, require advanced coronagraph designs to provide adequate starlight suppression. <BR /> Aims: We introduce a phase-only Lyot-plane optic to the vortex coronagraph, which offers improved contrast performance on telescopes with complicated apertures. Potential solutions for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) are described. <BR /> Methods: Adding a Lyot-plane phase mask relocates residual starlight away from a region of the image plane, thereby reducing stellar noise and improving sensitivity to off-axis companions. The phase mask is calculated using an iterative phase retrieval algorithm. <BR /> Results: Numerically, we achieve a contrast on the order of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> for a companion with angular displacement as small as 4λ/D with an E-ELT type aperture. Even in the presence of aberrations, improved performance is expected compared to either a conventional vortex coronagraph or an optimized pupil plane phase element alone., We present methods for optimizing pupil and focal plane optical elements that improve the performance of vortex coronagraphs on telescopes with obstructed or segmented apertures. Phase-only and complex masks are designed for the entrance pupil, focal plane, and the plane of the Lyot stop. Optimal masks are obtained using both analytical and numerical methods. The latter makes use of an iterative error reduction algorithm to calculate ""correcting"" optics that mitigate unwanted diffraction from aperture obstructions. We analyze the achieved performance in terms of starlight suppression, contrast, off-axis image quality, and chromatic dependence. Manufacturing considerations and sensitivity to aberrations are also discussed. This work provides a path to joint optimization of multiple coronagraph planes to maximize sensitivity to exoplanets and other faint companions., A set of pupil apodization functions for use with a vortex coronagraph on telescopes with obscured apertures is presented. We show analytically that pupil amplitudes given by real-valued Zernike polynomials offer ideal on-axis starlight cancellation when applied to unobscured circular apertures. The charge of the vortex phase element must be a nonzero even integer, greater than the sum of the degree and the absolute value of its azimuthal order of the Zernike polynomial. Zero-valued lines and points of Zernike polynomials, or linear combinations thereof, can be matched to obstructions in the pupils of ground-based telescopes to improve the contrast achieved by a vortex coronagraph. This approach works well in the presence of a central obscuration and radial support structures. We analyze the contrast, off-axis throughput, and post-coronagraph point spread functions of an apodized vortex coronagraph designed for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). This technique offers very good performance on apertures with large obscuring support structures similar to those on future 30-40m class ground-based telescopes.","['10.48550/arXiv.2308.10395', '2023arXiv230810395R', 'arXiv:2308.10395', '10.1117/12.2676853', '2023SPIE12680E..18R', '2022arXiv220713742R', '10.48550/arXiv.2207.13742', 'arXiv:2207.13742', '2022SPIE12180E..24R', '10.1117/12.2628972', '10.1117/12.2561593', '2020SPIE11443E..2OR', '10.48550/arXiv.2012.07728', '2020arXiv201207728R', 'arXiv:2012.07728', '2020arXiv201003704R', 'arXiv:2010.03704', '2020JATIS...6d5002R', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.03704', '10.1117/1.JATIS.6.4.045002', '2020arXiv201010541R', '2020JATIS...6d5005R', '10.1117/1.JATIS.6.4.045005', 'arXiv:2010.10541', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.10541', '2019AGUFM.P51H3446R', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.09780', '2019SPIE11117E..16R', 'arXiv:1908.09780', '10.1117/12.2528555', '2019arXiv190809780R', 'arXiv:1908.09786', '2019SPIE11117E..1FR', '10.48550/arXiv.1908.09786', '10.1117/12.2528625', '2019arXiv190809786R', '10.48550/arXiv.1901.04090', '2019arXiv190104090R', '2019AJ....157..118R', 'arXiv:1901.04090', '10.3847/1538-3881/aafee2', '2018arXiv180906483R', '2018ApJ...867..143R', 'arXiv:1809.06483', '10.48550/arXiv.1809.06483', '10.3847/1538-4357/aae262', '10.1117/12.2312948', 'arXiv:1807.07042', '2018arXiv180707042R', '10.48550/arXiv.1807.07042', '2018SPIE10698E..2SR', '2018arXiv180706758R', '10.48550/arXiv.1807.06758', 'arXiv:1807.06758', '10.1117/12.2312973', '2018SPIE10698E..4UR', '10.48550/arXiv.1803.03909', '10.1117/1.JATIS.4.1.015004', 'arXiv:1803.03909', '2018arXiv180303909R', '2018JATIS...4a5004R', '2017arXiv171202042R', '10.48550/arXiv.1712.02042', 'arXiv:1712.02042', '2017arXiv170805787R', '2017SPIE10400E..0JR', '10.1117/12.2274508', '10.48550/arXiv.1708.05787', 'arXiv:1708.05787', '2017koa..prop..283R', 'arXiv:1706.07489', '2017arXiv170607489R', '10.3847/1538-3881/aa7b81', '2017AJ....154...73R', '10.48550/arXiv.1706.07489', '2017koa..prop...11R', '2016koa..prop..489R', '2016SPIE.9912E..2LR', '2016arXiv160706400R', '10.1117/12.2231715', '10.48550/arXiv.1607.06400', 'arXiv:1607.06400', '2016PhDT........22R', '10.1051/0004-6361/201526561', '2015A&A...583A..81R', '10.48550/arXiv.1509.05750', 'arXiv:1509.05750', '2015arXiv150905750R', '2015arXiv150905794R', '10.1117/12.2187236', '10.48550/arXiv.1509.05794', 'arXiv:1509.05794', '2015SPIE.9605E..1IR', 'arXiv:1412.8731', '2014arXiv1412.8731R', '10.48550/arXiv.1412.8731']","[('coronagraph', 47), ('telescope', 42), ('contrast', 36), ('design', 31), ('performance', 31), ('vortex', 30), ('imaging', 27), ('planet', 23), ('high', 22), ('optical', 21)]","[(('space', 'telescope'), 16), (('high', 'contrast'), 15), (('coronagraph', 'design'), 14), (('vortex', 'coronagraph'), 13), (('contrast', 'imaging'), 12), (('deformable', 'mirror'), 10), (('vortex', 'coronagraphs'), 10), (('coronagraph', 'instrument'), 8), (('focal', 'plane'), 8), (('future', 'space'), 6)]","[(('high', 'contrast', 'imaging'), 12), (('future', 'space', 'telescopes'), 6), (('contrast', 'imaging', 'testbed'), 5), (('jet', 'propulsion', 'laboratory'), 5), (('imaging', 'testbed', 'facility'), 4), (('nasa', 'jet', 'propulsion'), 4), (('testbed', 'facility', 'nasa'), 3), (('facility', 'nasa', 'jet'), 3), (('surface', 'height', 'resolution'), 3), (('exoplanet', 'exploration', 'program'), 3)]",Dirty

These X-ray-emitting structures roughly divide into two components: a non-thermal corona that is geometrically compact, and a thermal disk that is geometrically thin. During the intermediate state, the response time for coronal variability to get thermalized by the disk is much longer than current reverberation models predict, based on considering only light-travel time delays. We show that the timescale for irradiation to thermalize inside the electron-scattering-dominated accretion disk atmosphere can plausibly rival or exceed the light-travel timescale, potentially explaining the anomalously long-duration thermal reverberation lags in X-ray binaries. Our analytic toy model cannot fully explain the observed lags, but it motivates the need for higher-fidelity models that include time delay effects from electron scattering., A spin-orbit misalignment refers to the directional mismatch between the spin and orbital angular momenta of a black hole in a binary system. Spin-orbit misalignments in X-ray binaries are likely more common than previously appreciated, but are difficult to measure precisely. Presumably, the misalignment mechanism is an asymmetric core-collapse giving the natal black hole a 'kick' that reorients the binary orbit. In this talk, we demonstrate a method to validate binary evolution models, by using observational constraints of individual X-ray binaries with extreme misalignments. Our results raise concerns about the unvalidated prescriptions for common envelope evolution and mass transfer that binary evolution models adopt, and/or the assumption that the jet axis traces the black hole spin axis on large scales. Our methodology can be applied to the growing list of X-ray binary systems with spin-orbit misalignment constraints, and offers a new way to validate the binary evolution models now routinely used in studies related to compact object mergers., Reverberation mapping is a promising technique to map out the structures closest to a black hole that cannot be imaged. These X-ray-emitting structures roughly divide into two components: a non-thermal corona and a thermal disk. We show that the timescale for coronal irradiation to thermalize inside the electron-scattering-dominated accretion disk atmosphere can plausibly rival or exceed the light-travel timescale, potentially explaining the anomalously long-duration thermal reverberation lags in X-ray binaries. Our analytic toy model cannot fully explain the observed lags, but it motivates the need for higher-fidelity models that include time delay effects from electron scattering., Universal to black hole X-ray binaries, the high-frequency soft lag gets longer during the hard-to-intermediate state transition, evolving from ≲1 to ~10 ms. The soft lag production mechanism is thermal disk reprocessing of nonthermal coronal irradiation. X-ray reverberation models account for the light-travel time delay external to the disk, but assume instantaneous reprocessing of the irradiation inside the electron-scattering-dominated disk atmosphere. We model this neglected scattering time delay as a random walk within an α-disk atmosphere, with approximate opacities. To explain soft lag trends, we consider a limiting case of the scattering time delay that we dub the thermalization time delay, t <SUB>th</SUB>; this is the time for irradiation to scatter its way down to the effective photosphere, where it gets thermalized, and then scatter its way back out. We demonstrate that t <SUB>th</SUB> plausibly evolves from being inconsequential for low mass accretion rates $\dot{m}$ ṁ characteristic of the hard state, to rivaling or exceeding the light-travel time delay for $\dot{m}$ ṁ characteristic of the intermediate state. However, our crude model confines t <SUB>th</SUB> to a narrow annulus near peak accretion power dissipation, so cannot yet explain in detail the anomalously long-duration soft lags associated with larger disk radii. We call for time-dependent models with accurate opacities to assess the potential relevance of a scattering delay., The two established techniques for measuring black hole spin in X-ray binaries often yield conflicting results, which must be resolved before either method may be deemed robust. In practice, black hole spin measurements based on fitting the accretion disc continuum effectively do not marginalize over the colour-correction factor f<SUB>col</SUB>. This factor parametrizes spectral hardening of the disc continuum by the disc atmosphere, whose true properties are poorly constrained. We incorporate reasonable systematic uncertainties in f<SUB>col</SUB> into the eight (non-maximal) black hole spin measurements vetted by the disc continuum fitting community. In most cases, an f<SUB>col</SUB> uncertainty of ±0.2-0.3 dominates the black hole spin error budget. We go on to demonstrate that plausible departures in f<SUB>col</SUB> values from those adopted by the disc continuum fitting practitioners can bring the discrepant black hole spins into agreement with those from iron line modelling. Systematic uncertainties in f<SUB>col</SUB>, such as the effects of strong magnetization, should be better understood before dismissing their potentially dominant impact on the black hole spin error budget., Of the known microquasars, V4641 Sgr boasts the most severe lower limit (&gt;52°) on the misalignment angle between the relativistic jet axis and the binary orbital angular momentum. Assuming the jet and black hole spin axes coincide, we attempt to explain the origin of this extreme spin-orbit misalignment with a natal kick model, whereby an aligned binary system becomes misaligned by a supernova kick imparted to the newborn black hole. The model inputs are the kick velocity distribution, which we measure customized to V4641 Sgr, and the immediate pre/post-supernova binary system parameters. Using a grid of binary stellar evolution models, we determine post-supernova configurations that evolve to become consistent with V4641 Sgr today and obtain the corresponding pre-supernova configurations by using standard prescriptions for common envelope evolution. Using each of these potential progenitor system parameter sets as inputs, we find that a natal kick struggles to explain the origin of the V4641 Sgr spin-orbit misalignment. Consequently, we conclude that evolutionary pathways involving a standard common envelope phase followed by a supernova kick are highly unlikely for V4641 Sgr. An alternative interpretation is that the jet axis does not reliably trace the black hole spin axis. Our results raise concerns about compact object merger statistics gleaned from binary population synthesis models, which rely on unverified prescriptions for common envelope evolution and natal kicks. We also challenge the spin-orbit alignment assumption routinely invoked to measure black hole spin magnitudes., Variability observed from X-ray binaries may be attributed to accreting gas whose angular momentum is misaligned to that of the black hole. Conventional theory predicts alignment between the jet axis and the black hole spin axis, which implies significant spin-orbit misalignments in GRO J1655-40 (&gt;15 degrees) and V4641 Sgr (&gt;60 degrees). For GRO J1655-40, we model the clean disk continuum in a series of high/soft state Swift/XRT observations, and measure an inner disk inclination of 85 degrees. This is in agreement with the jet axis inclination and supports the use of the jet axis as a tracer for the black hole spin orientation. For V4641 Sgr, we show that the spin-orbit misalignment production model of a linear momentum supernova kick applied to an aligned system cannot explain the misalignment observed today. This suggests that the supernova imparted angular momentum to the natal black hole and/or that the pre-supernova system was misaligned., Conventional theory predicts alignment between three axes of a microquasar system: the black hole spin axis, the relativistic jet axis, and the rotational axis of the inner regions of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk. These axes need not be aligned to the binary orbital axis. Using five Swift/XRT observations of the microquasar GRO J1655-40 in the high/soft state, we fit these data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis that incorporates Gaussian priors to leverage our knowledge of independent constraints on known system parameters. The data strongly reject the binary orbital inclination as an imposed prior on the inner disk inclination, regardless of the choice for black hole spin. Instead, the data require a near edge-on disk inclination ≥ 85°, which is consistent with the relativistic jet axis inclination of 85° ± 2°. This is evidence for disk-jet alignment and provides independent confirmation of a ≈15° misalignment between the angular momenta of the black hole and binary orbit in GRO J1655-40., Angular momentum, or spin, is one of only two fundamental properties of astrophysical black holes, and measuring its value has numerous applications. For instance, obtaining reliable spin measurements could constrain the growth history of supermassive black holes and reveal whether relativistic jets are powered by tapping into the black hole spin reservoir. The two well-established techniques for measuring black hole spin can both be applied to X-ray binaries, but are in disagreement for cases of non-maximal spin. This discrepancy must be resolved if either technique is to be deemed robust. We show that the technique based on disc continuum fitting is sensitive to uncertainties regarding the disc atmosphere, which are observationally unconstrained. By incorporating reasonable uncertainties into black hole spin probability density functions, we demonstrate that the spin measured by disc continuum fitting can become highly uncertain. Future work toward understanding how the observed disc continuum is altered by atmospheric physics, particularly magnetic fields, will further strengthen black hole spin measurement techniques., Observations of blueshifted absorption lines associated with black hole X-ray binary accretion disk winds sometimes imply a magnetic driving mechansim. To study the properties of magnetized disks, we performed shearing box simulations (stratified, isothermal, ideal MHD) with different amounts of net vertical magnetic flux, spanning essentially the entire range over which the MRI is linearly unstable. This net vertical flux sets the strength of the dominant toroidal field that is generated by the MRI-dynamo. Given sufficiently large net vertical flux, magnetic pressure support against gravity dominates throughout the vertical column of the disk. Without net poloidal flux, a strongly magnetized state cannot persist because the toroidal field buoyantly escapes faster than it can be replenished. With increasing disk magnetization: (1) toroidal field reversals characteristic of the MRI-dynamo become less frequent and more sporadic and (2) gas density becomes more inhomogeneous, with field concentrating in low-density regions. We are currently investigating whether magnetic pressure support in the disk atmosphere alters the disk continuum spectrum, which would bring the robustness of black hole spin measurements into question., Recent observations are suggestive of strongly magnetized accretion disks around black holes. Performing local (shearing box) simulations of accretion disks, we investigate how a strong magnetization state can develop and persist. We demonstrate that poloidal flux is a necessary prerequisite for the sustainability of strongly magnetized accretion disks. We also show that black hole spin measurements can become unconstrained if magnetic fields provide a significant contribution to the vertical pressure support of the accretion disk atmosphere., Motivated by indirect observational evidence for strongly magnetized accretion discs around black holes, and the novel theoretical properties of such solutions, we investigate how a strong magnetization state can develop and persist. To this end, we perform local simulations of accretion discs with an initially purely toroidal magnetic field of equipartition strength. We demonstrate that discs with zero net vertical magnetic flux and realistic boundary conditions cannot sustain a strong toroidal field. However, a magnetic pressure-dominated disc can form from an initial configuration with a sufficient amount of net vertical flux and realistic boundary conditions. Our results suggest that poloidal flux is a necessary prerequisite for the sustainability of strongly magnetized accretion discs., Strongly magnetized accretion discs around black holes have attractive features that may explain enigmatic aspects of X-ray binary behaviour. The structure and evolution of these discs are governed by a dynamo-like mechanism, which channels part of the accretion power liberated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) into an ordered toroidal magnetic field. To study dynamo activity, we performed three-dimensional, stratified, isothermal, ideal magnetohydrodynamic shearing box simulations. The strength of the self-sustained toroidal magnetic field depends on the net vertical magnetic flux, which we vary across almost the entire range over which the MRI is linearly unstable. We quantify disc structure and dynamo properties as a function of the initial ratio of mid-plane gas pressure to vertical magnetic field pressure, β _0^mid = p_gas / p_B. For 10^5 ≥ β _0^mid ≥ 10 the effective α-viscosity parameter scales as a power law. Dynamo activity persists up to and including β _0^mid = 10^2, at which point the entire vertical column of the disc is magnetic pressure dominated. Still stronger fields result in a highly inhomogeneous disc structure, with large density fluctuations. We show that the turbulent steady state β<SUP>mid</SUP> in our simulations is well matched by the analytic model of Begelman et al. describing the creation and buoyant escape of toroidal field, while the vertical structure of the disc can be broadly reproduced using this model. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for observed properties of X-ray binaries., Accretion discs are staples of astrophysics. Tapping into the gravitational potential energy of the accreting material, these discs are highly efficient machines that produce copious radiation and extreme outflows. While interesting in their own right, accretion discs also act as tools to study black holes and directly influence the properties of the Universe. Black hole X-ray binaries are fantastic natural laboratories for studying accretion disc physics and black hole phenomena. Among many of the curious behaviors exhibited by these systems are black hole state transitions -- complicated cycles of dramatic brightening and dimming. Using X-ray observations with high temporal cadence, we show that the evolution of the accretion disc spectrum during black hole state transitions can be described by a variable disc atmospheric structure without invoking a radially truncated disc geometry. The accretion disc spectrum can be a powerful diagnostic for measuring black hole spin if the effects of the disc atmosphere on the emergent spectrum are well-understood; however, properties of the disc atmosphere are largely unconstrained. Using statistical methods, we decompose this black hole spin measurement technique and show that modest uncertainties regarding the disc atmosphere can lead to erroneous spin measurements. The vertical structure of the disc is difficult to constrain due to our ignorance of the contribution to hydrostatic balance by magnetic fields, which are fundamental to the accretion process. Observations of black hole X-ray binaries and the accretion environments near supermassive black holes provide mounting evidence for strong magnetization. Performing numerical simulations of accretion discs in the shearing box approximation, we impose a net vertical magnetic flux that allows us to effectively control the level of disc magnetization. We study how dynamo activity and the properties of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability depend on the magnetized state of the gas, spanning weak-to-strong disc magnetization regimes. We also demonstrate that a background poloidal magnetic flux is required to form and sustain a strongly magnetized accretion disc. This thesis motivates the need for understanding how magnetic fields affect the observed spectrum from black hole accretion discs., Strongly magnetized accretion disks around black holes have many attractive features that may explain the enigmatic behavior observed from X-ray binaries. The physics and structure of these disks are governed by a dynamo-like mechanism, which channels the accretion power liberated by the magnetorotational instability into an ordered toroidal magnetic field. To study dynamo activity, we performed three-dimensional, stratified, isothermal, ideal magnetohydrodynamic shearing box simulations. In our simulations, the strength of this self-sustained toroidal magnetic field depends on the net vertical magnetic flux we impose, which allows us to study weak-to-strong magnetization regimes. We find that the entire disk develops into a magnetic pressure-dominated state for a sufficiently strong net vertical magnetic flux. Over the two orders of magnitude in net vertical magnetic flux that we consider, the effective α-viscosity parameter scales as a power-law. We quantify dynamo properties of toroidal magnetic flux production and its buoyant escape as a function of disk magnetization. Finally, we compare our simulations to an analytic model for the vertical structure of strongly magnetized disks applicable to the high/soft state of X-ray binaries., The innermost regions of accretion disks in black hole X-ray binaries dominate the observed X-ray emission, which is the main diagnostic that one uses to gain insights into the physics of black holes and accretion. The standard spectrum predicted from a geometrically thin, optically thick disk experiences non-trivial modification due to conspiring physical effects operating within the vertical disk structure such as Comptonization, free-free emission/absorption, bound-free opacities, and energy dissipation by magnetic processes. The complicated interplay of these effects cause the seed accretion disk spectrum to become hardened and it is this hardened emergent spectrum that we observe. To zeroth order, this hardening can be described by a phenomenological parameter called the spectral hardening factor.In practice, the adopted degree of spectral hardening is confined to lie within a rather restrictive range. I will discuss the following consequences of relaxing this criterion, while still requiring the spectral hardening factor to take on physically plausible values. Examining multiple state transitions of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 with archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, I will show that appealing to a spectral hardening factor that varies during state transitions provides a viable alternative to a truncated disk model for the evolution of the inner accretion disk. Having demonstrated that moderate degrees of accretion disk spectral hardening cannot be ruled out by observations, I will explore this possibility from a theoretical standpoint. Extending previous work on radiative transfer modeling coupled to the vertical disk structure, I present the impacts on the emergent accretion disk spectrum caused by disk inclination and by allowing accretion power to be dissipated in the corona. Using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a localized patch of the accretion disk (i.e., shearing box) performed with the Athena code, I will present the evolution of magnetic structures in the corona. Lastly, I will demonstrate that adopting physically plausible values for the spectral hardening factor can alleviate discrepancies between different black hole spin measurement techniques., Understanding the spectral and geometric properties of the innermost regions of accretion disks in black hole X-ray binaries is a long-standing topic of active observational and theoretical pursuit. The non-trivial modification of the accretion disk spectrum due to conspiring physical effects such as Comptonization, free-free emission/absorption, bound-free opacities, and energy dissipation by magnetic processes is described by the phenomenological spectral hardening factor, which is often confined to a restricted parameter range. The inclination of the inner disk plane is often assumed to align with the binary orbital plane. Both the level of hardening of the disk spectrum and the orientation of the inner disk are difficult to constrain observationally. We present work on physically plausible ranges of the spectral hardening factor and inner disk-binary misalignment, suggesting that the previous assumptions of mild spectral hardening and alignment require closer inspection. Relaxing these assumptions, we demonstrate that adopting physically plausible values for the spectral hardening and inner disk-binary misalignment can alleviate discrepancies between different black hole spin measurement techniques., We perform a suite of two- and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the ATHENA code of the non-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the subsonic, weak magnetic field limit. Focusing the analysis on the non-linear turbulent regime, we quantify energy transfer on a scale-by-scale basis and identify the physical mechanisms responsible for energy exchange by developing the diagnostic known as spectral energy transfer function analysis. At late times when the fluid is in a state of MHD turbulence, magnetic tension mediates the dominant mode of energy injection into the magnetic reservoir, whereby turbulent fluid motions twist and stretch the magnetic field lines. This generated magnetic energy turbulently cascades to smaller scales, while being exchanged backwards and forwards with the kinetic energy reservoir, until finally being dissipated. Incorporating explicit dissipation pushes the dissipation scale to larger scales than if the dissipation were entirely numerical. For scales larger than the dissipation scale, we show that the physics of energy transfer in decaying MHD turbulence is robust to numerical effects., We present an accretion cycle that explains state transitions and many other observed phenomena in black hole X-ray binaries. This model is based on the process of disk tearing, where individual rings of gas break off the disk and precess effectively independently. The disk breaks within the radius where the Lense-Thirring precession is stronger than the local disk viscosity. The complete disk tearing process occurs in the intermediate state during the outburst rise stage as follows. Angular momentum cancellation of adjacent gas rings causes prompt infall onto an inner accretion disk. This sudden increase in mass accretion rate onto the black hole provides the conditions for the ejection of a transient jet. Interior to the disk break radius, a dynamic corona naturally forms from the shock-heated gas that does not cool effectively after the counter-rotating rings interact. The system then enters the high/soft state when the inner disk aligns with the black hole spin vector out to beyond the disk break radius, which halts disk breaking. We highlight the implications of this model for quasi-periodic oscillations and the disk-jet-corona coupling., Constraining the accretion flow geometry of black hole binaries in outburst is complicated by the inability of simplified multicolour disc models to distinguish between changes in the inner disc radius and alterations to the emergent spectrum, parametrized by the phenomenological colour-correction factor, f<SUB>col</SUB>. We analyse Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the low-mass Galactic black hole X-ray binary, GX 339-4, taken over seven epochs when the source was experiencing a state transition. The accretion disc component is isolated using a pipeline resulting in robust detections for disc luminosities, 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ≲ L<SUB>disc</SUB>/L<SUB>Edd</SUB> ≲ 0.5. Assuming that the inner disc remains situated at the innermost stable circular orbit over the course of a state transition, we measure the relative degree of change in f<SUB>col</SUB> required to explain the spectral evolution of the disc component. A variable f<SUB>col</SUB> that increases by a factor of ∼2.0-3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to the low/hard state can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution. For the observations dominated by a disc component, the familiar scaling between the disc luminosity and effective temperature, L_disc ∝ T_eff<SUP>4</SUP>, is observed; however, significant deviations from this relation appear when GX 339-4 is in the hard intermediate and low/hard states. Allowing for an evolving f<SUB>col</SUB> between spectral states, the L_disc-T_eff<SUP>4</SUP> law is recovered over the full range of disc luminosities, although this depends heavily on the physically conceivable range of f<SUB>col</SUB>. We demonstrate that physically reasonable changes in f<SUB>col</SUB> provide a viable description for multiple state transitions of a black hole binary without invoking radial motion of the inner accretion disc., Theoretical models involving the interplay of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk embedded in an extended coronal atmosphere may describe black hole X-ray binaries across all spectral states. Buoyant magnetic field generated in the accretion disk is continuously supplied to the corona by a dynamo process driven by the magnetorotational instability. This rising field leads to the formation of a magnetic pressure-dominated, low-density, geometrically thick corona where substantial accretion energy is dissipated, likely by collisionless magnetic reconnection, perhaps even generating outflows. Despite the potential importance of magnetic reconnection in shaping the energetics and kinematics of the corona, studies of multiple reconnection sites in a large volume are currently prohibited by the computational expense required to properly treat the microphysical nature of reconnection. Under the assumption that coronal structure is determined by ideal magnetohydrodynamics, we analyze local simulations of accretion disks (i.e., shearing boxes) performed with the ATHENA code, where the spatial domains are extended to capture 'mesoscale' structures that are dynamically important in accretion disk evolution. We employ a location routine to identify zones of enhanced current density, which trace likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We describe the positions, orientations, sizes, shapes, strengths, and kinematics of these regions and correlate them with the spatial distribution of numerical dissipation. Statistical distributions of these various properties of current density zones are presented to determine the heights within the corona that contribute most to the dissipation rate, the flow properties associated with reconnection sites, and representative parameters for future large volume reconnection simulations., The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is ubiquitous in astrophysical phenomena involving shear layers including accretion disks, jet boundaries, and differentially rotating stars. The linear growth phase of the KHI and its subsequent evolution into turbulence is well-studied; however, the details of energy transfer and spectral structure in the non-linear evolution remain poorly understood. We perform high resolution, 3D simulations of the KHI in the subsonic, weakly magnetized regime using the magnetohydrodynamics code ATHENA and study its development into complete turbulence. We employ a Fourier transfer function analysis to gain insight into energy transfer at different length scales during the non-linear stages of the KHI. In the non-linear regime, the magnetic field amplification is dominated by transfer of kinetic energy into magnetic energy on large spatial scales due to turbulent motions doing work against the magnetic tension force. Large scale magnetic energy is transferred to small spatial scales via a turbulent cascade and is dissipated shortly thereafter at the dissipation scale. Using the transfer function analysis to study numerical dissipation effects, we find that magnetic dissipation exceeds kinetic dissipation by a factor of 2, which is consistent with prior studies of numerical dissipation in MHD turbulence with ATHENA., We present adaptively binned X-ray temperature maps for a sample of galaxy clusters created from joint spectral fitting to XMM-Newton and Chandra archival data. The overall distribution of temperature in a cluster is more tightly constrained for maps produced by joint fitting than from fits to individual spectra alone. Mach number distributions are generated from temperature gradients, providing insight into the magnitude of shocks within the cluster. Major mergers are expected to produce shock structure, tracing the formation history of galaxy clusters. Applying our shock finding method to simulated temperature maps created with the Enzo N-body + hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement cosmological code, we find that the underlying Mach number distribution is recovered from the temperature structure after applying our binning scheme. While the quality of temperature maps generated from joint spectral fitting strongly depends on reliable calibration between the different instruments, we find our method to be a promising probe of the temperature structure in cluster environments and potentially the merger history., The inner accretion disk geometry of black hole binaries (BHBs) in transition between the low/hard and high/soft states is important for understanding accretion flow around black holes. In the low/hard state a discrepancy exists over whether the cool, optically thick accretion disk extends close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) or is truncated out to hundreds of gravitational radii. XTE J1650-500 was observed during a transition from the low/hard to the high/soft spectral state by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The recession of the accretion disk in BHBs has previously been claimed due to shifts in low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) during outburst. Here we show that a thermal disk component is required over much of the transition with a color temperature that closely follows the L<SUB>X</SUB> T<SUP>4</SUP> relation. Furthermore, we show that for an inner disk radius that remains close to the ISCO, the observed evolution in the disk spectrum can be explained by a changing spectral hardening factor (f<SUB>col</SUB>) incorporated into the disk component, although this result strongly depends on the physically conceivable range of f<SUB>col</SUB>. We conclude that variations in f<SUB>col</SUB> may contribute to the observed changes in accretion disk spectra and must be fully considered before claiming the disappearance of the inner disk region in the low/hard state., Upper limits on the shock speeds in supernova remnants can be combined with post-shock temperatures to obtain upper limits on the ratio of cosmic ray to gas pressure (P <SUB>CR</SUB>/P<SUB>G</SUB> ) behind the shocks. We constrain shock speeds from proper motions and distance estimates, and we derive temperatures from X-ray spectra. The shock waves are observed as faint Hα filaments stretching around the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant in two epochs of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) separated by 39.1 years. We measured proper motions of 18 nonradiative filaments and derived shock velocity limits based on a limit to the Cygnus Loop distance of 576 ± 61 pc given by Blair et al. for a background star. The Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) instrument on-board ROSAT observed the X-ray emission of the post-shock gas along the perimeter of the Cygnus Loop, and we measure post-shock electron temperature from spectral fits. Proper motions range from 2farcs7 to 5farcs4 over the POSS epochs and post-shock temperatures range from kT ~ 100-200 eV. Our analysis suggests a cosmic ray to post-shock gas pressure consistent with zero, and in some positions P <SUB>CR</SUB> is formally smaller than zero. We conclude that the distance to the Cygnus Loop is close to the upper limit given by the distance to the background star and that either the electron temperatures are lower than those measured from RO","['2023HEAD...2011620S', '2023HEAD...2011618S', '2023AAS...24240803S', 'arXiv:2209.14304', '2022ApJ...940L..22S', '2022arXiv220914304S', '10.3847/2041-8213/ac9cdd', '10.48550/arXiv.2209.14304', '2020arXiv201011948S', '10.1093/mnras/staa3325', '2021MNRAS.500.3640S', '10.48550/arXiv.2010.11948', 'arXiv:2010.11948', '2020MNRAS.tmp.3127S', '2020MNRAS.500.3640S', 'arXiv:2004.08392', '2020MNRAS.tmp.1226S', '10.1093/mnras/staa1094', '10.48550/arXiv.2004.08392', '2020MNRAS.495.2179S', '2020arXiv200408392S', '2019HEAD...1711238S', '2019AAS...23313301S', '2018AAS...23142303S', '2017HEAD...1610821S', '2017AAS...22910704S', '2016MNRAS.460.3488S', '10.1093/mnras/stw1231', 'arXiv:1602.04810', '2016MNRAS.tmp..896S', '2016arXiv160204810S', '10.48550/arXiv.1602.04810', '2016MNRAS.457..857S', '2015arXiv151106368S', '10.1093/mnras/stw029', 'arXiv:1511.06368', '10.48550/arXiv.1511.06368', '2016PhDT.......151S', '2016AAS...22742308S', '2015AAS...22522502S', '2014HEAD...1420503S', 'arXiv:1303.5052', '2013MNRAS.tmp.2932S', '2014MNRAS.438.1355S', '10.1093/mnras/stt2281', '2013arXiv1303.5052S', '10.48550/arXiv.1303.5052', '2014AAS...22315525S', '2013arXiv1303.2116S', '10.48550/arXiv.1303.2116', 'arXiv:1303.2116', '2013MNRAS.431.3510S', '10.1093/mnras/stt436', '2013HEAD...1312629S', '2012AAS...21915430S', '2011AAS...21714914S', '2011BAAS...4314914S', '2010BAAS...42R.225S', '2010AAS...21540406S', '2008arXiv0812.2515S', 'arXiv:0812.2515', '10.1088/0004-637X/702/1/327', '10.48550/arXiv.0812.2515', '2009ApJ...702..327S', '2009ApJ...692..753S', '10.48550/arXiv.0809.4691', '2008arXiv0809.4691S', 'arXiv:0809.4691', '10.1088/0004-637X/692/1/753', '2009AAS...21348803S', '2009BAAS...41R.462S']","[('disk', 74), ('black', 62), ('hole', 62), ('accretion', 55), ('disc', 51), ('ray', 46), ('magnetic', 43), ('binary', 42), ('spin', 39), ('state', 33)]","[(('black', 'hole'), 62), (('accretion', 'disk'), 27), (('hole', 'spin'), 25), (('ray', 'binary'), 23), (('accretion', 'disc'), 15), (('magnetic', 'field'), 14), (('spectral', 'hardening'), 12), (('hole', 'ray'), 10), (('spin', 'measurement'), 10), (('net', 'vertical'), 10)]","[(('black', 'hole', 'spin'), 24), (('black', 'hole', 'ray'), 10), (('hole', 'ray', 'binaries'), 7), (('net', 'vertical', 'magnetic'), 7), (('vertical', 'magnetic', 'flux'), 7), (('strongly', 'magnetized', 'accretion'), 7), (('spectral', 'hardening', 'factor'), 7), (('spin', 'orbit', 'misalignment'), 5), (('high', 'soft', 'state'), 5), (('toroidal', 'magnetic', 'field'), 5)]",Dirty

Two major challenges arise for characterizing stellar activity cycles: 1) most measurable features are very low amplitude or require expensive spectroscopic observations to detect, and 2) monitoring for years to decades is needed to detect long term changes. Flares offer a novel opportunity to characterize variations in stellar surface activity from large sky surveys like Kepler and TESS, which now span more than 10 years of monitoring for some sources. Flare rates on the Sun vary by a factor of more than 100 from activity maximum to minimum, making flares one of the largest amplitude and most easily detected signals of activity cycle behavior. Here we present our ongoing study of low-mass stars showing both short- (months) and long-term (years) variations in flare activity., Several technosignature techniques focus on historic events such as SN 1987A as the basis to search for coordinated signal broadcasts from extraterrestrial agents. The recently discovered SN 2023ixf in the spiral galaxy M101 is the nearest Type II supernova in over a decade, and will serve as an important benchmark event. Here we review the potential for SN 2023ixf to advance ongoing techonsignature searches, particularly signal-synchronization techniques such as the ""SETI Ellipsoid"" that identifies over time stars that could transmit signals after observing a supernovae event. We find that more than 100 stars within 100 pc are already close to intersecting this SETI Ellipsoid, providing numerous targets for real-time monitoring within ~3° of SN 2023ixf. We are commencing a radio technosignature monitoring campaign of these targets with the Allen Telescope Array and the Green Bank Telescope., The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) Ellipsoid is a geometric method for prioritizing technosignature observations based on the strategy of receiving signals synchronized to conspicuous astronomical events. Precise distances to nearby stars from Gaia makes constraining Ellipsoid crossing times possible. Here we explore the utility of using the Gaia Catalog of Nearby Stars to select targets on the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, as well as the Ellipsoids defined by 278 classical novae. Less than 8% of stars within the 100 pc sample are inside the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, meaning the vast majority of nearby stars are still viable targets for monitoring over time. We find an average of 734 stars per year within the 100 pc volume will intersect the Ellipsoid from SN 1987A, with ~10% of those having distance uncertainties from Gaia better than 0.1 lyr., The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) Ellipsoid is a geometric method for prioritizing technosignature observations based on the strategy of receiving signals synchronized to conspicuous astronomical events.

While this quasi-periodic behavior has been studied for hundreds of years on our Sun, it has been incredibly difficult to detect from nearby stars. Basic properties of stellar activity cycles therefore remain unconstrained, including the ranges of cycle periods, and the ages of stars that exhibit such cycles. Stellar flares offer a novel, and so far unrealized opportunity to constrain magnetic activity cycles. Rates of stochastic flare outbursts on the Sun are observed to vary by at least an order of magnitude from activity cycle maximum to minimum. Flares should therefore be one of the highest-amplitude indicators of activity cycles in nearby stars. Precision light curves from the Kepler, K2, and TESS missions provide a new ability to precisely constrain stellar flare rates for thousands of nearby active stars, which can then be harnessed to search for variations on years timescales due to activity cycles. We propose to use light curves from these key NASA exoplanet hunting missions to place the first constraints on activity cycles from flare rate variations for over 6000 low- mass nearby stars. This work will build on a nearly 60-year legacy of ground-based activity cycle monitoring, and establish the TESS mission as the most powerful mission for constraining magnetic activity variations in nearby stars. We will continue to build on the methods for flare detection and analysis that these missions have already produced, and will develop new statistical tests for comparing flare rates over time between surveys with differing observing baselines and apertures, such as from Kepler to TESS. By searching for activity cycles for nearby low-mass stars with a range of ages, we will be exploring the past and future of the Sun's magnetic dynamo. This is key to both advancing our understanding of how this fundamental property of the Sun operates, as well as constraining the stellar environments that potentially habitable exoplanets might form and evolve within. Our work will further develop the legacy of the Kepler, K2, and TESS missions as the benchmark for studying stellar flares, and establish TESS as a transformational platform for understanding magnetic activity for stars across nearly the whole sky for potentially decades to come., The Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard (DASCH) is an effort to create a uniform digital catalog of photometric measurements from astro-photographic plates taken between 1885 and 1992. Each plate is digitized by back-illuminating it and scanning using a CCD camera. That image is then calibrated based on the plate's sensitivity, and Point-Spread Function (PSF) photometry is computed for each source in the image. <P />(2 data files)., HS Hydrae is a short period eclipsing binary (P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 1.57 day) that belongs to a rare group of systems observed to have rapidly changing inclinations. This evolution is due to a third star on an intermediate orbit, and results in significant differences in eclipse depths and timings year to year. Zasche &amp; Paschke revealed that HS Hydrae's eclipses were rapidly fading from view, predicting they would cease around 2022. Using 25 days of photometric data from Sector 009 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we find that the primary eclipses for HS Hydrae were only 0.00173 &amp;PlusMinus; 0.00007 mag in depth in March 2019. This data from TESS likely represents the last eclipses detected from HS Hydrae. We also searched the Digitization of the Harvard Astronomical Plate Collection archive for historic data from the system. With a total baseline of over 125 yr, this unique combination of data sets-from photographic plates to precision space-based photometry-allows us to trace the emergence and decay of eclipses from HS Hydrae, and further constrain its evolution. Recent TESS observations from Sector 035 confirm that eclipses have ceased for HS Hya, and we estimate they will begin again in 2195., We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of GJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare events detected in the 2 minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative flare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are found in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period and phase as in Kepler. As expected for this highly active M4, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of solar-like activity cycles over 10 yr. However, we highlight the unique ability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles for many years to come. New 20-second cadence data from TESS will also allow us to test the widely used empirical flare profile created for GJ 1243 using Kepler 1-minute data., HS Hydra belongs to a rare group of short period eclipsing binaries observed to have rapidly changing inclinations. This evolution is due to a third star on an intermediate orbit, and results in significant differences in eclipse depths year-to-year. Zasche &amp; Paschke (2012) revealed that HS Hydra's eclipses were rapidly fading from view, predicting they would cease around 2022. Using 27 days of photometric data from Sector 009 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we find that the primary eclipses for HS Hydra were only 0.0075 magnitudes in depth in March 2019. This data from TESS likely represents the last eclipses detected from HS Hydra. We also searched the Digitization of the Harvard Astronomical Plate Collection (DASCH) archive for historic data from the system. With a total baseline of over 125 years, this unique combination of datasets - from photographic plates to precision space-based photometry - allows us to trace the emergence and decay of eclipses from HS Hydra, and further constrain its evolution. We estimate eclipses for HS Hydra will end in Feb 2021, and will begin again in 2196., The flaring M4 dwarf GJ 1243 has become a benchmark for studying stellar flare and starspot activity thanks to the exceptional photometric monitoring archive from the Kepler mission. New light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission for this star allow precise stellar activity characterization over more than a decade timescale. We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of GJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare events detected in the 2 minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative flare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are found in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period and phase as seen in Kepler. The phase of the secondary spot feature is consistent with the predicted location of the secondary starspot and measurement of weak differential rotation, suggesting this secondary spot may be long-lived and stable in both latitude and longitude. As expected for this highly active star, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of solar-like activity cycles over 10 yr. However, we highlight the unique ability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles., Modern wide-field, time domain surveys enable a new approach to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence life in the coming decade: spatio-temporal SETI, where technosignatures may be discovered from spatially resolved sources or multiple stars over time. Optical surveys such as ZTF and the Evryscope can probe 10-100 times more of the ""Cosmic Haystack"" parameter space volume than many traditional radio investigations. Small-aperture, high cadence surveys like Evryscope can be comparable in their Haystack volume completeness to deeper surveys including LSST. Investigations with these surveys can also be conducted at a fraction of the cost of dedicated SETI surveys, since they make use of data already being gathered. However, SETI methodology has not widely utilized such surveys, and the field is in need of new search algorithms that can account for signals in both the spatial and temporal domains. I will outline the broad potential for these surveys to revolutionize our search for technosignatures, and illustrate some example search algorithms., Exoplanet hunting surveys, including Kepler and K2, have begun a new era for stellar magnetic activity studies, particularly for white light flares. Continuous light curves with months to years baselines, and unmatched photometric precision, has led to discoveries including ""superflares"" on solar-type stars, the evolution of flare activity with stellar age, and the most statistically complete census of flares to date for thousands of stars. The TESS mission is now capturing new light curves for most of the known benchmark flare stars, extending this space-based study of stellar activity across the sky. Here we revisit many of the best-studied flare stars from the Kepler mission with TESS. We find the flare recovery capability for TESS is well matched in comparison to the Kepler archive. Further, the 10-year baseline of observations between Kepler and TESS allow a new search for stellar activity cycles via changes in flare rate, which we expect to vary by an order of magnitude based on the Solar example. As TESS continues to gather high fidelity light curves across 85% of the sky, we anticipate flare rate variations to be an important new method for detecting stellar activity cycles, and further informing our understanding of stellar dynamos., Traditional searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) or ""technosignatures"" focus on dedicated observations of single stars or regions in the sky to detect excess or transient emission from intelligent sources. The newest generation of synoptic time domain surveys enable an entirely new approach: spatio-temporal SETI, where technosignatures may be discovered from spatially resolved sources or multiple stars over time. Current optical time domain surveys such as ZTF and the Evryscope can probe 10-100 times more of the ""Cosmic Haystack"" parameter space volume than many radio SETI investigations. Small-aperture, high cadence surveys like Evryscope can be comparable in their Haystack volume completeness to deeper surveys including LSST. Investigations with these surveys can also be conducted at a fraction of the cost of dedicated SETI surveys, since they make use of data already being gathered. However, SETI methodology has not widely utilized such surveys, and the field is in need of new search algorithms that can account for signals in both the spatial and temporal domains. Here I describe the broad potential for modern wide-field time domain optical surveys to revolutionize our search for technosignatures, and illustrate some example SETI approaches using transiting exoplanets to form a distributed beacon., Generated during the 2018 Gaia Sprint, Ingot is a demonstration of using simple machine learning libraries with Gaia DR2 and WISE photometry to infer stellar metallicity., , Using a recent census of flare stars from the Kepler survey, we have explored how flare activity evolves across stellar main-sequence lifetimes. We utilize a sample of 347 stars with robust flare activity detections and which have rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their Kepler light curves. We consider three separate methods for quantifying flare activity from optical light curves and compare their utility for comparing flare activity between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include the fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution (FFD). With all three approaches, we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass stars as they spin down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change in the power-law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed of younger, more active stars, our model overpredicts the superflare rate previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model of the FFD for ease in predicting the rates of flares and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection., We have entered an era in observational astronomy in which sky surveys routinely release massive datasets. While this wealth of data is critical for determining rates of rare phenomena (e.g. transiting exoplanets or tidal disruption events), it also enables a new kind of data-driven astrophysics (e.g. ""hidden"" correlations in our data that point towards new or challenging undetandings of physics). Machine learning is simply one tool available to us to discover these new trends or make predictions from our growing volume of data. However, machine learning alone cannot make astrophysical discoveries, and astronomers are still required to interpret astrophysical meaning from our data. Here I will discuss some uses of machine learning in analyzing data from the Kepler and Gaia missions, and attempt to highlight some of the opportunities and limitations in its use., While the Kepler and K2 missions were designed to search for Earth-like exoplanets, their impact has reached far beyond the statistics of planet occurrence. Over the past decade, the Kepler/K2 platform has generated the most precise light curves ever produced for nearly a half million stars. With these data we are discovering new astrophysics of stars, and in turn revealing clues about the formation history of our own Galaxy. Here I will highlight a few key discoveries and mysteries about stellar populations within our Galaxy that Kepler/K2 have found, and point to a bright future for this field with upcoming missions like TESS., We have matched the astrometric data from Gaia Data Release 2 to the sample of stars with measured rotation periods from Kepler. Using 30,305 stars with good distance estimates, we select 16,248 as being likely main-sequence single stars centered within a 0.5 mag region about a 1 Gyr isochrone, removing many subgiants and unresolved binary stars from the sample. The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by McQuillan et al., is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is correlated with height above the Galacitc plane, with the ratio of rapidly rotating younger stars dropping strongly for stars above Z &gt; 90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of ΔM <SUB> G </SUB> ∼ 0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient may indicate that main-sequence evolution produces offsets in color-magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models., The enigmatic star KIC 8462852, informally known as “Boyajian’s Star,” has exhibited unexplained variability from both short timescale (days) dimming events, and years-long fading in the Kepler mission. No single physical mechanism has successfully explained these observations to date. Here we investigate the ultraviolet variability of KIC 8462852 on a range of timescales using data from the GALEX mission that occurred contemporaneously with the Kepler mission. The wide wavelength baseline between the Kepler and GALEX data provides a unique constraint on the nature of the variability. Using 1600 s of photon-counting data from four GALEX visits spread over 70 days in 2011, we find no coherent NUV variability in the system on 10-100 s or month timescales. Comparing the integrated flux from these 2011 visits to the 2012 NUV flux published in the GALEX-CAUSE Kepler survey, we find a 3% decrease in brightness for KIC 8462852. We find that this level of variability is significant, but not necessarily unusual for stars of similar spectral type in the GALEX data. This decrease coincides with the secular optical fading reported by Montet &amp; Simon. We find that the multi-wavelength variability is somewhat inconsistent with typical interstellar dust absorption, but instead favors a {R}<SUB>V</SUB>=5.0+/- 0.9 reddening law potentially from circumstellar dust., Kepler stars with rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their light curves have been matched against the astrometric data from Gaia Data Release 1. A total of 1,299 bright rotating stars were recovered, most with temperatures hotter than 5000 K. From these, 894 were selected as being near the main sequence. These main sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered around a ~600 Myr rotation-isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiant and binary stars. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within 300pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. I will discuss how the combination of Kepler/K2/TESS with Gaia will enable us to map the star formation history of our galactic neighborhood., Many current and future exoplanet missions are pushing to infrared (IR) wavelengths where the flux contrast between the planet and star is more favorable (Deming et al. 2009), and the impact of stellar magnetic activity is decreased. Indeed, a recent analysis of starspots and faculae found these forms of stellar activity do not substantially impact the transit signatures or science potential for FGKM stars with JWST (Zellem et al. 2017). However, this is not true in the case of flares, which I demonstrate can be a hinderance to transit studies in this note., Our data come from three surveys that differ greatly in their sky coverage, photometric depth, and wavelength coverage. <P />The optical photometry for our study came from the SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8; Aihara et al. 2011ApJS..193...29A). <P />The mid-infrared photometry we used came from the latest AllWISE data release (Cutir et al., 2013, Cat. II/328). <P />Astrometric calibration for WISE was achieved by matching sources to the full-sky 2MASS point source catalog (Wright et al. 2010AJ....140.1868W). <P />(2 data files)., We propose the first systematic search for rotation periods from field stars in the K2 archive. Our study will produce a catalog of nearly 100,000 stellar rotation periods measured with Kepler/K2. This large dataset of rotation periods allows us to create an age map of the stars within each field of view in the K2 mission, and to determine the cause of the mysterious distribution of rotation periods discovered previously with Kepler. Age is typically the most difficult basic property to measure for stars, yet its key to understanding the formation history of the Milky Way, as well as exoplanet system formation and evolution. Rotation gives the most useful ""clock"" for normal isolated stars due to steady angular momentum loss during majority of star's life. Kepler/K2 are the ideal datasets for conducting a survey of stellar rotation due to long observation durations, and very precise monitoring to detect faint modulation due to cool starspots rolling in-to and out-of view. Previous results from Kepler revealed a two-peaked distribution of rotation periods for stars. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this feature, and both require a greater sample of rotation to be amassed. To accomplish these goals we will use new open source tools based on ""Gaussian Processes"" to remove systematic noise and measure periodic signals in the K2 data. Stellar ages are estimated using spin-down models updated from Kepler data. With the wide variety of stars from across the Galaxy contained in the K2 dataset, we will determine how far from the Sun the two-peaked period distribution exists. The results from our global K2 period search will contribute to the important legacy of the Kepler mission for studying stellar astrophysics. As new models are produced to investigate the nature of stellar angular momentum loss and magnetic activity, this dataset will be a benchmark for studying these basic properties for stars of all ages. The tools and data products developed will also be valuable testbeds for measuring rotation periods and ages of stars in NASA's upcoming TESS mission., Astrometric data from the recent Gaia Data Release 1 have been matched against the sample of stars from Kepler with known rotation periods. A total of 1299 bright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good astrometric solutions, most with temperatures above 5000 K. From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main-sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting that the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ∼300 pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations that is created by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia., For this study I analyzed every available long- and short-cadence light curve from the primary Kepler mission, obtaining the most recently available version of the Quarter 0-17 (May 2009-Apr 2013) light curves, known as Data Release 24. <P />(1 data file)., We present a study of white-light flares from the active M5.5 dwarf Proxima Centauri using the Canadian microsatellite Microvariability and Oscillations of STars. Using 37.6 days of monitoring data from 2014 to 2015, we have detected 66 individual flare events, the largest number of white-light flares observed to date on Proxima Cen. Flare energies in our sample range from 10<SUP>29</SUP> to 10<SUP>31.5</SUP> erg. The flare rate is lower than that of other classic flare stars of a similar spectral type, such as UV Ceti, which may indicate Proxima Cen had a higher flare rate in its youth. Proxima Cen does have an unusually high flare rate given its slow rotation period, however. Extending the observed power-law occurrence distribution down to 10<SUP>28</SUP> erg, we show that flares with flux amplitudes of 0.5% occur 63 times per day, while superflares with energies of 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg occur ∼8 times per year. Small flares may therefore pose a great difficulty in searches for transits from the recently announced 1.27 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> Proxima b, while frequent large flares could have significant impact on the planetary atmosphere., A homogeneous search for stellar flares has been performed using every available Kepler light curve. An iterative light curve de-trending approach was used to filter out both astrophysical and systematic variability to detect flares. The flare recovery completeness has also been computed throughout each light curve using artificial flare injection tests, and the tools for this work have been made publicly available. The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is ∼10<SUP>35</SUP> erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g - I color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of ∼0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number., The appaloosa suite automates flare-finding in every Kepler light curves. It builds quiescent light curve models that include long- and short-cadence data through iterative de-trending and includes completeness estimates via artificial flare injection and recovery tests., This release includes a little more documentation, a few more bugs ironed out, and will be released to Zenodo so that it can be cited properly in papers. So far PyDIS has been used to reduce data from DIS on the APO 3.5m, and has been hacked/modified to reduce data from MMT and DCT by others. Thus, having built upon ""Not Obviously Wrong"", I deem PyDIS officially ""Possibly Useful"" to others., This release is substantively identical to v1.0, which was released to Zenodo, but now includes a license file. The code directory has also been organized some., An automated flare-finding software suite in Python for Kepler light curves. Includes completeness estimates via artificial flare injection and recovery tests., Data from the Kepler and K2 missions continue to challenge our understanding of stellar activity, from complex morphologies of flares on low-mass stars, to rates of ""superflares"" on stars like the Sun. I will present results from the first uniform search for stellar flares in every Kepler light curve. This is the largest sample of white-light stellar flares ever assembled. Our analysis includes long- and short-cadence data from over 200,000 stars, and will shed light on the possibility of using flares as a stellar age indicator. I will also describe the exciting prospects that K2, TESS, and LSST hold for studying stellar flares in a Galactic context., Ultra-precise light curves from Kepler provide the best opportunity to determine rates and statistical properties of stellar flares. From 11 months of data on the active M4 dwarf, GJ 1243, we have built the largest catalog of flares for a single star: over 6100 events. Combining 885 of our most pristine flares, we generated an empirical white-light flare template. This high-fidelity template shows a rapid initial rise, and two distinct exponential cooling phases. This template is useful in constraining flare energies and for improved flare detection in many surveys. Complex, multi-peaked events are more common for higher energy flares in this sample. Using our flare template we characterize the structure of complex events. In this contributed talk, I presented results from our boutique study of GJ 1243, and described an expanded investigation of the structure of complex flares and their connection to solar events., Long duration, ultra-precise, continuous light curves from Kepler provide the best opportunity to gather complete rates and determine statistical properties of stellar flares. From nearly a year of high cadence data on the active M4 dwarf, GJ 1243, we have carefully built the largest catalog of flares ever amassed for a star besides the Sun: over 6100 unique flare events. We combined 885 of the most pristine flares in this sample to generate an empirical white-light flare template. This high-fidelity template shows a rapid initial rise phase, and two distinct phases of exponential cooling, which we relate to the physical processes in the standard flare model. This template will be useful to constrain flare energies in a variety of sparsely sampled surveys, and for improved flare detection in high cadence light curves. We find complex, multi-peaked events are more common for higher energy flares in this sample. Using our flare template we characterize the structure of these complex events, constraining the rate of random superpositions versus triggered flare events in the light curve., Starspots are a fundamental manifestation of stellar dynamos that constrain the surface magnetic field strength and topology. Kepler has already produced the first ensemble studies of starspots, discovering rotation periods and rough spot properties for thousands of stars across the main sequence. Here we study the G dwarf Kepler 17, which hosts a transiting 2.5 Jupiter mass exoplanet on a 1.5 day orbit. Starspots are frequently occulted during transit, allow","['2024AAS...24335501D', 'arXiv:2306.03118', '10.3847/2515-5172/acdc24', '10.48550/arXiv.2306.03118', '2023arXiv230603118D',

Most admissions systems require three letters for each applicant, burdening both letter writers and admissions committees with a heavy work load that may not be time well-spent.

Ideally, letters of recommendation will showcase the students' promise for a research career, but in practice, the letters often do not fulfill this purpose., CMB-S4 will map the cosmic microwave background to unprecedented precision, while simultaneously surveying the millimeter-wave time-domain sky, in order to advance our understanding of cosmology and the universe. CMB-S4 will observe from two sites, the South Pole and the Atacama Desert of Chile. A combination of small- and large-aperture telescopes with hundreds of thousands of polarization-sensitive detectors will observe in several frequency bands from 20-300 GHz, surveying more than 50% of the sky to arcminute resolution with unprecedented sensitivity. CMB-S4 seeks to make a dramatic leap in sensitivity while observing across a broad range of largely unprotected spectrum which is increasingly being utilized for terrestrial and satellite transmissions. Fundamental aspects of CMB instrument technology leave them vulnerable to radio frequency interference (RFI) across a wide range of frequencies, including frequencies outside of their observing bands. Ground-based CMB instruments achieve their extraordinary sensitivities by deploying large focal planes of superconducting bolometers to extremely dry, high-altitude sites, with large fractional bandwidths, wide fields of view, and years of integration time. Suitable observing sites have historically offered significant protection from RFI, both naturally through their extremely remote locations as well as through restrictions on local emissions. Since the coupling mechanisms are complex, ""safe"" levels or frequencies of emission that would not interfere with CMB measurements cannot always be determined through straightforward calculations. We discuss models of interference for various types of RFI relevant to CMB-S4, mitigation strategies, and the potential impacts on survey sensitivity., We present the conceptual design of the modular detector and readout system for the Cosmic Microwave Background - Stage four (CMB-S4) ground-based survey experiment. CMB-S4 will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the millimeter-wave sky to unprecedented sensitivity, using 500,000 superconducting detectors observing from Chile and Antarctica to map over 60% of the sky. The fundamental building block of the detector and readout system is a detector module package operated at 100 mK, which is connected to a readout and amplification chain that carries signals out to room temperature. It uses arrays of feedhorn-coupled orthomode transducers (OMT) that collect optical power from the sky onto dc-voltage-biased transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers. The resulting current signal in the TESs is then amplified by a two-stage cryogenic Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) system with a time-division multiplexer to reduce wire count, and matching room-temperature electronics to condition and transmit signals to the data acquisition system. Sensitivity and systematics requirements are being developed for the detector and readout system over wide range of observing bands (20 to 300 GHz) and optical powers to accomplish CMB-S4's science goals. While the design incorporates the successes of previous generations of CMB instruments, CMB-S4 requires an order of magnitude more detectors than any prior experiment. This requires fabrication of complex superconducting circuits on over 10 m2 of silicon, as well as significant amounts of precision wiring, assembly and cryogenic testing, The CMB Stage 4 (CMB-S4) experiment is a next-generation, ground-based experiment that will measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization to unprecedented accuracy, probing the signature of inflation, the nature of cosmic neutrinos, relativistic thermal relics in the early universe, and the evolution of the universe. CMB-S4 will consist of O(500,000) photon-noise-limited detectors that cover a wide range of angular scales in order to probe the cosmological signatures from both the early and late universe. It will measure a wide range of microwave frequencies to cleanly separate the CMB signals from galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds. To advance the progress towards designing the instrument for CMB-S4, we have established a framework to optimize the instrumental configuration to maximize its scientific output. The framework combines cost and instrumental models with a cosmology forecasting tool, and evaluates the scientific sensitivity as a function of various instrumental parameters. The cost model also allows us to perform the analysis under a fixed-cost constraint, optimizing for the scientific output of the experiment given finite resources. In this paper, we report our first results from this framework, using simplified instrumental and cost models. We have primarily studied two classes of instrumental configurations: arrays of large-aperture telescopes with diameters ranging from 2-10 m, and hybrid arrays that combine small-aperture telescopes (0.5-m diameter) with large-aperture telescopes. We explore performance as a function of telescope aperture size, distribution of the detectors into different microwave frequencies, survey strategy and survey area, low-frequency noise performance, and balance between small and large aperture telescopes for hybrid configurations. Both types of configurations must cover both large (~ degree) and small (~ arcmin) angular scales, and the performance depends on assumptions for performance vs. angular scale. The configurations with large-aperture telescopes have a shallow optimum around 4-6 m in aperture diameter, assuming that large telescopes can achieve good performance for low-frequency noise. We explore some of the uncertainties of the instrumental model and cost parameters, and we find that the optimum has a weak dependence on these parameters. The hybrid configuration shows an even broader optimum, spanning a range of 4-10 m in aperture for the large telescopes. We also present two strawperson configurations as an outcome of this optimization study, and we discuss some ideas for improving our simple cost and instrumental models used here. There are several areas of this analysis that deserve further improvement. In our forecasting framework, we adopt a simple two-component foreground model with spatially varying power-law spectral indices. We estimate de-lensing performance statistically and ignore non-idealities such as anisotropic mode coverage, boundary effect, and possible foreground residual. Instrumental systematics, which is not accounted for in our analyses, may also influence the conceptual design. Further study of the instrumental and cost models will be one of the main areas of study by the entire CMB-S4 community. We hope that our framework will be useful for estimating the influence of these improvements in the future, and we will incorporate them in order to further improve the optimization., The Advancing Space Science through Undergraduate Research Experience (ASSURE) summer REU program is an NSF-funded REU site at the Space Sciences Lab at UC Berkeley that first started in summer 2014. The program recruits students from all STEM majors, targeting underserved students including community college students and first-generation college students. The students have little or no research experience and a wide variety of academic backgrounds, but have a shared passion for space sciences and astronomy. We will describe our program's structure and the components we have found successful in preparing and supporting both the students and their research advisors for their summer research projects. This includes an intensive first week of introductory lectures and tutorials at the start of the program, preparing students for working in an academic research environment. The program also employs a multi-tiered mentoring system, with layers of support for the undergraduate student cohort, as well as graduate student and postdoctoral research advisors., POLARBEAR is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. The science goals of the POLARBEAR project are to do a deep search for CMB B-mode polarization created by inflationary gravitational waves, as well as characterize the CMB B-mode signal from gravitational lensing. POLARBEAR-1 started observations in 2012, and the POLARBEAR team has published a series of results from its first season of observations, including the first measurement of a non-zero B-mode polarization angular power spectrum, measured at sub-degree scales where the dominant signal is gravitational lensing of the CMB. Recently, we released an improved measurement of the B-mode polarization power spectrum, improving our band-power uncertainties by a factor of two, by adding new data from our second observing season and re-analyzing the combined data set.To further improve on these measurements, POLARBEAR is expanding to include an additional two telescopes with multi-chroic receivers observing at 95, 150, 220, and 270 GHz, known as the Simons Array. With high sensitivity and large sky coverage, the Simons Array will create a detailed survey of B-mode polarization, and its spectral information will be used to extract the CMB signal from astrophysical foregrounds. We will present the latest POLARBEAR results, as well as the status of development of the Simons Array and its expected capabilities., POLARBEAR is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. The science goals of the POLARBEAR project are to do a deep search for CMB B-mode polarization created by inflationary gravitational waves, as well as characterize the CMB B-mode signal from gravitational lensing. POLARBEAR-1 started observations in 2012. The POLARBEAR team has published results from its first season of observations on a small fraction of the sky, including a measurement of a non-zero B-mode polarization angular power spectrum at sub-degree scales, where the dominant signal is gravitational lensing of the CMB. Improving these measurements requires precision characterization of the CMB polarization signal over large fractions of the sky, at multiple frequencies. To achieve these goals, POLARBEAR has begun expanding to include an additional two 3.5 meter telescopes with multi-chroic receivers, known as the Simons Array. With high sensitivity and large sky coverage, the Simons Array will create a detailed survey of B-mode polarization, and its spectral information will be used to extract the CMB signal from astrophysical foregrounds. The Simons Array data will place strong constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, when combined with data from the next generation of baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. We present the status of this funded instrument and its expected capabilities., POLARBEAR is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. POLARBEAR-1 started observations in 2012, and in 2014, the POLARBEAR team published results from its first season of observations on a small fraction of the sky. These results include the first measurement of a non-zero B-mode polarization angular power spectrum, measured at sub-degree scales where the dominant signal is gravitational lensing of the CMB. We also published a measurement of the large-scale gravitational structure deflection power spectrum derived from CMB polarization alone, which demonstrates a powerful technique that can be used to measure nearly all of the gravitational structure in the universe. Improving these measurements requires precision characterization of the CMB polarization signal over large fractions of the sky, at multiple frequencies. To achieve these goals, POLARBEAR has begun expanding to include an additional two 3.5 meter telescopes with multi-chroic receivers, known as the Simons Array. Phased upgrades to receiver technology will improve sensitivity and capabilities, while continuing a deep survey of 80% of the sky. POLARBEAR-2 is the next receiver that will be installed in 2015 on a new telescope, with a larger area focal plane with dichroic pixels, with bands at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, and a total of 7,588 polarization sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensor bolometers. The focal plane is cooled to 250 milliKelvin, and the bolometers will be read-out by SQUID amplifiers with 40x frequency domain multiplexing. The array is designed to have a noise equivalent temperature of 5.7 μK√s., POLARBEAR-2 is a next-generation receiver for precision measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)). Scheduled to deploy in early 2015, it will observe alongside the existing POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope in the Simons Array on Cerro Toco in the Atacama desert of Chile. For increased sensitivity, it will feature a larger area focal plane, with a total of 7,588 polarization sensitive antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers, with a design sensitivity of 4.1 uKrt(s). The focal plane will be cooled to 250 milliKelvin, and the bolometers will be read-out with 40x frequency domain multiplexing, with 36 optical bolometers on a single SQUID amplifier, along with 2 dark bolometers and 2 calibration resistors. To increase the multiplexing factor from 8x for POLARBEAR-1 to 40x for POLARBEAR-2 requires additional bandwidth for SQUID readout and well-defined frequency channel spacing. Extending to these higher frequencies requires new components and design for the LC filters which define channel spacing. The LC filters are cold resonant circuits with an inductor and capacitor in series with each bolometer, and stray inductance in the wiring and equivalent series resistance from the capacitors can affect bolometer operation. We present results from characterizing these new readout components. Integration of the readout system is being done first on a small scale, to ensure that the readout system does not affect bolometer sensitivity or stability, and to validate the overall system before expansion into the full receiver. We present the status of readout integration, and the initial results and status of components for the full array., POLARBEAR-2 is a new receiver that will be installed in 2014 alongside the currently observing POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope as a part of the Simons Array. The science goals of the POLARBEAR project are to do a deep search for B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) created by inflationary gravitational waves, as well as characterize the CMB B-mode signal at smaller angular scales, where it originates from weak gravitational lensing. The Simons Array will include a total of three off-axis Gregorian telescopes with 3.5 m primary mirrors, located in the Chajnantor Astronomical Park in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Phased upgrades to receiver technology will enable us to improve sensitivity and capabilities, while continuing a deep survey of 80% of the sky. The POLARBEAR-2 receiver has a larger area focal plane with new dichroic pixels, with bands at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, and a total of 7,588 polarization sensitive antenna-coupled transition edge sensor bolometers. The focal plane is cooled to 250 milliKelvin, and the bolometers will be read-out by SQUID amplifiers with 32x frequency domain multiplexing. The focal plane is designed to have a noise equivalent temperature of 5.7 μK√s., POLARBEAR is a microwave telescope, located in the Atacama desert in Chile, that is measuring the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using a unique focal plane of 1274 antenna-coupled, polarization sensitive transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers cooled to 0.25 Kelvin, along with a 3.5 meter monolithic primary mirror, POLARBEAR will observe 700 square-degrees of the sky at 150 GHz with 3.5 arc-minute resolution. POLARBEAR's main science goal is to perform a deep search for the large-scale B-mode polarization signal of gravitational waves from inflation. POLARBEAR is also designed to characterize the B-mode polarization on small angular scales, where it originates from weak gravitational lensing of the CMB’s E-mode polarization by large scale structure. POLARBEAR had first light in January 2012, and is expected to reach a sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.025, at 95% confidence level, after two years of observing., The latest generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes is searching for the undetected faint signature of gravitational waves from inflation in the polarized signal of the CMB. To achieve the unprecedented levels of sensitivity required, these experiments use arrays of superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers that are cooled to sub-Kelvin temperatures for photon-noise limited performance. These TES detectors are read out using low- noise SQUID amplifiers. To rapidly test these detectors and similar devices in a laboratory setting, we constructed a cryogenic refrigeration chain consisting of a commercial two-stage pulse-tube cooler, with a base temperature of 3 K, and a closed-cycle 3He/4He/3He sorption cooler, with a base temperature of 220 mK. A commercial dc SQUID system, with sensors cooled to 4 K, was used as a highly-sensitive cryogenic ammeter. Due to the extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs to changing magnetic fields, there are several challenges involving cooling them with pulse-tube coolers. Here we describe the successful design and implementation of measures to reduce the vibration, electromagnetic interference, and other potential sources of noise associated with pulse-tube coolers.","['2024BAAS...56a.024B', '10.48550/arXiv.2412.08715', 'arXiv:2412.08715', '10.3847/25c2cfeb.5474fe92', '2024arXiv241208715B', '10.48550/arXiv.2207.13204', '2022arXiv220713204B', '2022SPIE12190E..02B', 'arXiv:2207.13204', '10.1117/12.2629651', '10.1117/12.2630494', '2022SPIE12190E..0BB', '2022arXiv220802284B', 'arXiv:2208.02284', '10.48550/arXiv.2208.02284', '2017arXiv170207467B', '10.48550/arXiv.1702.07467', '2018JCAP...02..009B', 'arXiv:1702.07467', '10.1088/1475-7516/2018/02/009', '2018AAS...23135904B', '2018AAS...23135602B', '2016AAS...22713902B', '2015AAS...22522001B', '2014SPIE.9153E..35B', 'arXiv:1410.7488', '2014arXiv1410.7488B', '10.1117/12.2055611', '10.48550/arXiv.1410.7488', '2014AAS...22320406B', '2013AAS...22143210B', 'arXiv:1301.0860', '2013arXiv1301.0860B', '10.48550/arXiv.1301.0860']","[('cmb', 42), ('polarbear', 29), ('polarization', 26), ('large', 18), ('telescope', 18), ('sensitivity', 17), ('frequency', 16), ('signal', 16), ('array', 16), ('mode', 16)]","[(('cosmic', 'microwave'), 12), (('microwave', 'background'), 12), (('mode', 'polarization'), 12), (('simon', 'array'), 10), (('focal', 'plane'), 9), (('background', 'cmb'), 9), (('atacama', 'desert'), 7), (('desert', 'chile'), 7), (('cmb', 'polarization'), 7), (('gravitational', 'lensing'), 7)]","[(('cosmic', 'microwave', 'background'), 12), (('microwave', 'background', 'cmb'), 9), (('atacama', 'desert', 'chile'), 7), (('transition', 'edge', 'sensor'), 6), (('large', 'aperture', 'telescopes'), 5), (('signal', 'gravitational', 'lensing'), 5), (('edge', 'sensor', 'tes'), 4), (('sensor', 'tes', 'bolometers'), 4), (('background', 'cmb', 'polarization'), 4), (('located', 'atacama', 'desert'), 4)]",Dirty

When used to model absorption-line data sets built from multi-sight line and/or spatially extended background probes, CLOUDFLEX enables detailed constraints on the size and velocity distributions of structures comprising the photoionized CGM., CloudFlex models observational signatures associated with the small-scale structure of the circumgalactic medium. It populates cool gas structures in the CGM as a complex of cloudlets using a Monte Carlo method. Various parameters can be set to describe the structure of the cloudlet complexes, including cloudlet mass, density, velocity, and size. Functionality exists for generating the observational signatures of sightlines piercing these cloudlet complexes, borrowing heavily from the Trident code (ascl:1612.019)., Traditional cosmological hydrodynamics simulations fail to spatially resolve the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the reservoir of tenuous gas surrounding a galaxy and extending to its virial radius. We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical modeling of the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout the virial halo of a simulated galaxy. We investigate the effects of EHR in the TEMPEST simulations, a suite of ENZO-based cosmological zoom simulations following the evolution of an L* galaxy, resolving spatial scales of 500 comoving pc out to 100 comoving kpc in galactocentric radius. Among its many effects, EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results in a boost in “low ions” like H I and a drop in “high ions” like O VI throughout the CGM. These effects of EHR do not converge in the TEMPEST simulations, but extrapolating these trends suggests that the CGM is actually a mist consisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended in a medium at the halo virial temperature. We find that EHR produces the above effects by (1) better sampling the distribution of CGM phases, enabling runaway cooling in the dense, cool tail of the phase distribution; and (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient hot halo and evaporating., The majority of galactic baryons reside outside of the galactic disk in the diffuse gas known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). While state-of-the art simulations excel at reproducing properties of the galactic disk, they struggle to reproduce the observational characteristics of the CGM, most notably the observed column densities and kinematics of cool (T 10^4 K) gas. The survival of cool gas in the CGM is governed by physical processes that are unresolved in existing simulations. Recent work has demonstrated how increasing halo resolution leads to qualitatively different abundances and behavior of the CGM, but this behavior is not predicted to converge until sub-parsec scales are reached. Even with adaptive mesh refinement, fully resolving the CGM at these scales requires computational resources not expected to exist for several decades. We propose developing the first subgrid model to track the unresolved cool phase of the CGM in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy evolution. The unique strength of this model is that it requires no tuning, as it derives from robust representations of the underlying small-scale physics. Our model and its implementation in two popular astrophysical hydrodynamics codes, Enzo and Gizmo, will be released publicly to help jump start use of this transformational method by the community. Lastly, the model will be employed on large-scale cosmological zoom simulations to address key science drivers of how the cool gas of the CGM behaves, where metals go, and how galaxies quench., Galactic gas accretion drives the formation and evolution of every galaxy. The circumgalactic medium, the tenuous gas surrounding a galaxy, acts as a direct probe of star formation, stellar feedback, and gas accretion, all responsible for a galaxy's fate. To date, attempts to model the multiphase CGM have failed to adequately match observations, leaving many unanswered questions regarding its origin, distribution, and kinematics. In this talk I will present synthetic observations of the CGM from the FIRE simulations and the TempestCGM simulations, two sets of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with extremely high spatial resolution. For the first time, these models are able to reproduce many of the CGM observational samples (e.g. COS-Halos), and they indicate that the size of the physical structures of the CGM are smaller than previously simulated (&lt; 1 kpc)., Hydrodynamical simulations are increasingly able to accurately model physical systems on stellar, galactic, and cosmological scales; however, the utility of these simulations is often limited by our ability to directly compare them with the data sets produced by observers: spectra, photometry, etc. To address this problem, we have created trident, a Python-based open-source tool for post-processing hydrodynamical simulations to produce synthetic absorption spectra and related data. trident can (I) create absorption-line spectra for any trajectory through a simulated data set mimicking both background quasar and down-the-barrel configurations; (II) reproduce the spectral characteristics of common instruments like the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph; (III) operate across the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared using customizable absorption-line lists; (IV) trace simulated physical structures directly to spectral features; (v) approximate the presence of ion species absent from the simulation outputs; (VI) generate column density maps for any ion; and (vii) provide support for all major astrophysical hydrodynamical codes. trident was originally developed to aid in the interpretation of observations of the circumgalactic medium and intergalactic medium, but it remains a general tool applicable in other contexts., Trident creates synthetic absorption-line spectra from astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations. It uses the yt package (ascl:1011.022) to read in simulation datasets and extends it to provide realistic synthetic observations appropriate for studies of the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intergalactic media., Astrophysical simulations are useful insofar as they aid in the interpretation of telescopic observations. Thus, a primary task in simulation analysis is in producing synthetic observations for direct comparison against observational data. Furthermore, we as a field need an effective means for storing these synthetic observable data products, such that they are accessible and searchable by the entire population of researchers. In this talk, we present Trident, a universal pipeline for producing synthetic spectra from any of the major hydrodynamics codes, and MISTY, a means of storing these spectra on the HST MAST data archive. Trident and MISTY are our attempts to solve the difficult problems of synthetic data production and publicly-accessible storage for the scientific communities studying the intergalactic medium and circumgalactic medium., Quasar absorption line studies are our primary source of information for revealing the state of the intergalactic and circumgalacic media (IGM and CGM). Using quasars as bright background sources, tenuous intervening gas clouds imprint absorption features in the resulting spectra providing clues to the clouds' density, temperature, metallicity, and ionization state. Correctly interpreting these spectra is crucial to understanding the distribution of baryons in the universe.Using the Trident code to generate synthetic spectra from high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we examine how spectral noise, instrument smoothing, and certain configurations of gas can mask the true nature of gas absorbers. We demonstrate how cold gas filaments can create broad spectral features mimicking hot absorbers, and chimneys of hot gas viewed side-on appear as narrow, cold absorbers. Understanding how commonly these conditions occur is critical for correctly characterizing the physical conditions in the media galactic., Hydrodynamical simulations can provide great insight into the behavior of many astrophysical problems. However, it can be difficult to extract the relevant quantities from these simulations for comparison against observational datasets. I will demonstrate methods for generating synthetic observations from hydrodynamical simulations using the open-source yt analysis code. Specifically, I will focus on creating realistic simulated spectra, which mimic quasar absorption line studies of the circumgalactic medium and the intergalactic medium as observed by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard HST. By producing simulated observations like those obtained with real telescopes, we can best compare theoretical models against their observational counterparts., Grasping the way gas gets in and out of galaxies is fundamental to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, and COS observations are slowly providing a better picture of these gas flows. Recent COS observations of the circumgalactic medium {CGM} have revealed two puzzles: the bimodal metallicity distribution of Lyman Limit Systems {LLSs} proximate to galaxies {Lehner et al. 2013} and the low volume density for cold absorbers in the CGM {Werk et al. 2014}. We propose to address both of these issues through the execution and analysis of grid-based cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution. By modeling galaxies at very high resolution using a physically-motivated, momentum-based feedback method, we will perform the first grid-based studies of the CGM at this scale, allowing us to identify analogs to the observed cold absorber population responsible for these puzzles. We will trace the simulated cold absorbers through time to understand their origins, producing a full picture of how they acquire and expel their gas., , Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution are increasingly able to produce realistic galaxies, but the largest hurdle remaining is in constructing subgrid models that accurately describe the behaviour of stellar feedback. As an alternate way to test and calibrate such models, we propose to focus on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). To do so, we generate a suite of adaptive mesh refinement simulations for a Milky-Way-massed galaxy run to z = 0, systematically varying the feedback implementation. We then post-process the simulation data to compute the absorbing column density for a wide range of common atomic absorbers throughout the galactic halo, including H I, Mg II, Si II, Si III, Si IV, C IV, N V, O VI and O VII. The radial profiles of these atomic column densities are compared against several quasar absorption line studies to determine if one feedback prescription is favoured. We find that although our models match some of the observations (specifically those ions with lower ionization strengths), it is particularly difficult to match O VI observations. There is some indication that the models with increased feedback intensity are better matches. We demonstrate that sufficient metals exist in these haloes to reproduce the observed column density distribution in principle, but the simulated CGM lacks significant multiphase substructure and is generally too hot. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failings of inflow-only models (without energetic feedback) at populating the CGM with adequate metals to match observations even in the presence of multiphase structure. Additionally, we briefly investigate the evolution of the CGM from z = 3 to present. Overall, we find that quasar absorption line observations of the gas around galaxies provide a new and important constraint on feedback models., We carry out adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations of Milky Way mass halos in order to investigate the formation of disk-like galaxies in a Λ-dominated cold dark matter model. We evolve a suite of five halos to z = 0 and find a gas disk formation in each; however, in agreement with previous smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (that did not include a subgrid feedback model), the rotation curves of all halos are centrally peaked due to a massive spheroidal component. Our standard model includes radiative cooling and star formation, but no feedback. We further investigate this angular momentum problem by systematically modifying various simulation parameters including: (1) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (2) an additional pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (3) low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1%; (4) fixed physical resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (5) a supernova feedback model that injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (6) a subgrid feedback model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation event. Of all of these, we find that only the last (cooling suppression) has any impact on the massive spheroidal component. In particular, a simulation with cooling suppression and feedback results in a rotation curve that, while still peaked, is considerably reduced from our standard runs., Employing the hydrodynamics code Enzo, we perform adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations to create and evolve a Milky-Way-mass disk galaxy in a larger cosmological environment. Using one set of initial conditions, we produce a series of runs where we systematically modify the star formation and stellar feedback models to investigate their effects on the dynamics of this galaxy by z = 0. Studying these results, we search for ways to avoid the spurious buildup of material in the core of the galaxy (i.e. the angular momentum problem) and for ways of producing realistic galactic outflows. The modifications made include: (i) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (ii) an additional pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (iii) low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1%; (iv) fixed physical resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (v) a supernova feedback model which injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (vi) a subgrid feedback model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation event. From these options, we find that only artificial cooling suppression has any impact on reducing the incidence of the angular momentum problem and producing a less-peaked rotation curve; however, even those runs which do not achieve flat rotation curves can produce outflows of metal-rich gas into the halo of this galactic system., Computational hydrodynamical simulations are a very useful tool for understanding how galaxies form and evolve over cosmological timescales not easily revealed through observations. However, they are only useful if they reproduce the sorts of galaxies that we see in the real universe. One of the ways in which simulations of this sort tend to fail is in the prescription of stellar feedback, the process by which nascent stars return material and energy to their immediate environments. Careful treatment of this interaction in subgrid models, so-called because they operate on scales below the resolution of the simulation, is crucial for the development of realistic galaxy models. Equally important is developing effective methods for comparing simulation data against observations to ensure galaxy models which mimic reality and inform us about natural phenomena. This thesis examines the formation and evolution of galaxies and the observable characteristics of the resulting systems. We employ extensive use of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations in order to simulate and interpret the evolution of massive spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way. First, we create a method for producing synthetic photometric images of grid-based hydrodynamical models for use in a direct comparison against observations in a variety of filter bands. We apply this method to a simulation of a cluster of galaxies to investigate the nature of the red-sequence/blue-cloud dichotomy in the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Second, we implement several subgrid models governing the complex behavior of gas and stars on small scales in our galaxy models. Several numerical simulations are conducted with similar initial conditions, where we systematically vary the subgrid models, afterward assessing their efficacy through comparisons of their internal kinematics with observed systems. Third, we generate an additional method to compare observations with simulations, focusing on the tenuous circumgalactic medium. Informed by our previous studies, we investigate the sensitivity of this new mode of comparison to hydrodynamical subgrid prescription. Finally, we synthesize the results of these studies and identify future avenues of research., , The GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS) is large targeted survey designed to measure the HI content of 1000 massive galaxies (log M*&gt;10) selected from the SDSS spectroscopic and GALEX imaging surveys. A principal goal of GASS is to provide an unbiased view of the processes responsible for the transition between blue, star-forming spirals and red, passively-evolving ellipticals. The combination of SDSS, GALEX and Arecibo data is producing a unique, homogeneous dataset of structural and physical parameters, star formation rates (SFRs) and gas properties of massive galaxies that will be of considerable legacy value for the astronomical community at large. In this talk we describe initial results on the HI properties of 250 galaxies, nearly a quarter of our sample, and present scaling relations between gas fraction and other physical properties including stellar mass, morphology, stellar mass surface density and star formation rate. We also highlight several unusual galaxies that may be in the process of accreting new gas or losing their remaining gas supply and discuss how data from several corollary programs (CO, ground-based long-slit spectroscopy) will be used to interpret our results., We have developed a method for producing projected photometric images for the outputs of the hydrodynamics code Enzo. Population synthesis models are applied to the Enzo stellar particles to produce synthetic spectra and broadband fluxes for each star particle. Projecting these star particles' positions and applying a dust attenuation prescription we produce realistic two-dimensional images in different filter bands. We apply this method to the outputs of a cosmological cluster simulation at z 0 and extract photometric information pertaining to individual galaxies present in the cluster. We compare the resulting data set with the photometric properties of a subsample of cluster galaxies that have been observed with GALEX, SDSS and 2MASS. In particular, we use our knowledge of the formation history of each simulated galaxy to relate the observed properties of galaxies to the physical processes driving their evolution in dense cluster environments., Our close neighboring galaxy at only 16 kpc from the Galactic center, Sagittarius (Sgr) exhibits the most dramatic gravitational stripping of any local galaxies with stellar tidal streams observed extending entirely around the Milky Way. Recent observations in dynamically older sections of the tidal tails demonstrate that extant numerical models of Sgr's orbit are inadequate to fit all available stream data. One interpretation of this data suggests that Sgr's orbit was more distant in the past and is spiraling in toward the Galactic center. This effect can be explained by dynamical friction, the drag force acting on a body as it travels through a field of point masses, a reasonable approximation of the Milky Way halo. Using numerical simulations which take into account dynamical friction, we seek to reproduce the full phase-space distribution of stars in Sgr's streams. This investigation could yield the first direct observation of dynamical friction in action.","['10.3847/1538-4357/ad5965', '10.48550/arXiv.2311.05691', 'arXiv:2311.05691', '2024ApJ...972..148H', '2023arXiv231105691H', 'ascl:2312.026', '2023ascl.soft12026H', '2018arXiv181112410H', '10.48550/arXiv.1811.12410', '10.3847/1538-4357/ab378f', '2019ApJ...882..156H', 'arXiv:1811.12410', '2019hst..prop15800H', '2018AAS...23120303H', '10.48550/arXiv.1612.03935', '2016arXiv161203935H', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa7e2d', 'arXiv:1612.03935', '2017ApJ...847...59H', 'ascl:1612.019', '2016ascl.soft12019H', '2016pyas.confE..11H', '10.5281/zenodo.48409', '2016AAS...22710907H', '2015AAS...22531406H', '2014hst..prop13917H', '2014glop.progE..13H', 'arXiv:1212.2965', '10.1093/mnras/sts702', '2013MNRAS.430.1548H', '10.48550/arXiv.1212.2965', '2013MNRAS.tmp..728H', '2012arXiv1212.2965H', '2012ApJ...749..140H', '10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/140', '10.48550/arXiv.1112.0009', 'arXiv:1112.0009', '2011arXiv1112.0009H', '2012AAS...21931107H', '2012PhDT.......115H', '2011gafo.confP.176H', '2010AAS...21537004H', '2010BAAS...42Q.561H', '2006AAS...20921114H', '2006BAAS...38R1192H', '2004BAAS...36.1581H', '2004AAS...20514202H']","[('mml', 82), ('simulation', 43), ('galaxy', 42), ('model', 36), ('gas', 34), ('cgm', 28), ('mi', 26), ('mrow', 22), ('observation', 20), ('medium', 19)]","[(('mml', 'mi'), 26), (('mml', 'mrow'), 22), (('mrow', 'mml'), 22), (('mi', 'mml'), 19), (('mml', 'mo'), 14), (('mo', 'mml'), 14), (('circumgalactic', 'medium'), 11), (('absorption', 'line'), 10), (('cool', 'gas'), 9), (('hydrodynamical', 'simulation'), 9)]","[(('mml', 'mrow', 'mml'), 22), (('mml', 'mi', 'mml'), 19), (('mml', 'mo', 'mml'), 14), (('mi', 'mml', 'mrow'), 10), (('mrow', 'mml', 'mi'), 9), (('mml', 'msub', 'mml'), 8), (('mo', 'mml', 'mo'), 7), (('mi', 'mml', 'mi'), 6), (('mrow', 'mml', 'mrow'), 6), (('circumgalactic', 'medium', 'cgm'), 5)]",Dirty

The American Institute of Physics (AIP) National Task Force to Elevate African American Representation in Undergraduate Physics &amp; Astronomy (TEAM-UP) conducted a comprehensive two-year study to gain insight into this persistent underrepresentation, and the results are in — many institutions aren't providing the support our students need to thrive. In a new, groundbreaking report, TEAM-UP identifies factors responsible for the success or failure of African American students in physics and astronomy, which will be outlined and summarized in this talk. One of the unique and critical components at the heart of the TEAM-UP research study were interviews and surveys of African American physics and astronomy students, who shared their insight, wisdom and advice with us. Combined with department chair surveys, site visits to high-performing departments and an extensive literature review, TEAM-UP identified five factors that contribute to the success of African American students. The TEAM-UP report provides recommendations tailored to each of the five success factors, in addition to five recommendations designed to help organizations manage the institutional change processes that will be necessary to implement these recommendations. We can no longer claim to not know why Black students are underrepresented in physics and astronomy; the question now is what are departments willing to do about it?, We evaluate the optical/near-infrared (OIR) color variability of 3C 279 in both γ-ray flaring and non-flaring states over 7-year timescales using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System in Cerro Tololo, Chile and γ-ray fluxes obtained from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This observing strategy differs from previous blazar color variability studies in two key ways: (1) the reported color variability is assessed across optical through near-infrared wavelengths, and (2) the color variability is assessed over timescales significantly longer than an individual flare or ground-based observing season. We highlight 3C 279 because of its complex color variability, which is difficult to reconcile with the simple “redder-when-brighter” behavior often associated with Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar color variability. We suggest that the observed OIR color changes depend on a combination of the jet and disk emission. We parameterize this behavior in terms of a single variable, {\zeta }<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>m</SUP>, representing a smooth transition from a disk-dominated system, to a mixed contribution, to a jet-dominated system, which provides an explanation of the long-term OIR color variability in the same blazar over time. This suggests a general scheme that could apply to OIR color variability in other blazars., We have undertaken a 7-year, multiwavelength program to observe a sample of blazars in various Fermi gamma-ray states, using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3m + ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. We present near-daily optical and infrared (OIR) color variability diagrams of these sources and compare the OIR flux and color to the Fermi gamma-ray flux on similar cadence. We then analyze the color variability properties on short and long timescales, as compared to the length of an average gamma-ray flare, to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for the variability properties that we observe. From this long-term observational data, we develop a schematic representation of the possible color variability behaviors in blazars and how it is related to the thermal disk and non-thermal jet contributions in both Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and BL Lac objects., As part of our ongoing SMARTS (optical/near-infrared) O/IR Blazar Monitoring program, we observe gamma-ray-bright blazars with the 1.3m+ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile (CTIO)., We have undertaken a 7-year, multiwavelength program to observe a sample of blazars in various Fermi gamma-ray states, using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3m + ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. We present near-daily optical and infrared (OIR) color variability diagrams of these sources and compare the OIR flux and color to the Fermi gamma-ray flux on similar cadence. We then analyze the color variability properties on short and long timescales, as compared to the length of an average gamma-ray flare, to better constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for the variability properties that we observe. By monitoring several activity states, we avoid the selection effects that previous studies have encountered when only observing blazars during flaring states. From this long-term observational data, we develop a schematic representation of the possible color variability behaviors in blazars and how it is related to the thermal disk and non-thermal jet contributions in both Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and BL Lac objects., As part of our O/IR blazar program, we monitor gamma-ray-bright blazars with the SMARTS 1.3m+ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. On 2015 September 23, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected an unusually hard spectrum gamma-ray flare from a source positionally consistent with the blazar PMN J2052-5533 (ATel #8096)., We present multi-epoch optical spectroscopy of seven southern Fermi-monitored blazars from 2008 to 2013 using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS), with supplemental spectroscopy and polarization data from the Steward Observatory. We find that the emission lines are much less variable than the continuum; four of seven blazars had no detectable emission line variability over the 5 yr observation period. This is consistent with photoionization primarily by an accretion disk, allowing us to use the lines as a probe of disk activity. Comparing optical emission line flux with Fermi γ-ray flux and optical polarized flux, we investigate whether relativistic jet variability is related to the accretion flow. In general, we see no such dependence, suggesting that the jet variability is likely caused by internal processes like turbulence or shock acceleration rather than a variable accretion rate. However, three sources showed statistically significant emission line flares in close temporal proximity to very large Fermi γ-ray flares. While we do not have sufficient emission line data to quantitatively assess their correlation with the γ-ray flux, it appears that in some cases the jet might provide additional photoionizing flux to the broad-line region (BLR), which implies that some γ-rays are produced within the BLR, at least for these large flares., We undertook a 6-year, multiwavelength program to observe a sample of blazars in various Fermi gamma-ray states, using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3m + ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. We present near-daily optical and infrared (OIR) color variability diagrams for a sample of 12 blazars. We then compare the OIR flux and color to the Fermi gamma-ray flux on similar cadence. We show that on long timescales (of order years), patterns emerge in the OIR color variability that are not seen on shorter timescales due to selection effects introduced by observing blazars in gamma-ray bright, jet-flaring states. By observing both active and quiescent jet flaring states, we show that previous short-term color variability behavior, e.g. 'redder when brighter' in FSRQs and 'bluer when brighter' in BL Lacs, represent ‘snapshots’ in a given blazars' color variability behavior over time. We present a schematic representation of the long-term OIR color variability in blazars, and propose that changes in the relative contribution of the disk and jet emission, migration of the gamma-emitting region to outside the broad line region, and injections of higher energy electrons in the jet itself contribute to the long-term OIR color variability that we observe., We undertook a 5 year, multiwavelength program to observe a sample of blazars in various Fermi $\gamma$-ray states, using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3 m + ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. We present near daily, optical-infrared (OIR) color variability to constrain competing emission in the OIR wavebands, presumably from the accretion disk and highly variable jet. The main results of previous short-term color variability studies are reproduced in most cases, namely that BL Lacs are bluer when brighter and FSRQs are redder when brighter. However, we extend this interpretation by providing a self-consistent way to explain blazars that did not behave as predicted by the existing dichotomy in blazar color variability. We show that over long timescales, patterns emerge in the OIR color variability that are not seen on shorter timescales due to the selection effects introduced by only observing blazars in $\gamma$-ray flaring states. By observing a large sample of blazars on up to 5 year timescales, we show that these short-term color variability 'snapshots' can be incorporated into a more comprehensive understanding of blazar OIR color variability, and by extension the contribution of non-thermal jet flux in the OIR regime. Finally, we address how long-term OIR color variability can constrain the disk-jet interaction in blazars., We recently observed PKS 1824-582 with the SMARTS 1.3m+ANDICAM instrument in Cerro Tololo, Chile. The ANDICAM instrument is capable of observing optical and infrared bands simultaneously using a dual-channel imager with a dichroic that feeds an optical CCD and infrared imager. ..., Blazars are active galactic nuclei whose relativistic jet is aligned at small angles (&lt; 5°) with respect to the Earth line of sight. Their broadband emission is generally jet-dominated, but during quiescent periods the thermal contribution can often still be detected, making them an ideal laboratory to study the energetics of infalling and outflowing material. The simultaneously obtained multiwavelength, long-term data analyzed here help to better evaluate the impact of jet power on the broadband spectral energy distributions of these sources via the OIR color variability analysis. Secondly, emission line variability studies presented here can help constrain the location of the gamma-emitting region as well set preliminary constraints on the minimum jet contribution necessary to significantly increase the photoionizing flux in the broad line region. I briefly discuss the main findings of this dissertation below. The optical and infrared (OIR) light curves and color variability diagrams for a sample of 12 blazars are presented. I analyze the OIR color variability of these blazars from 2011 - 2013, comparing their OIR properties to the jet state via Fermi gamma-ray fluxes obtained on a similar cadence. This project also assesses long-term color variability by extending the temporal baseline of 6 blazars to 5 years, allowing the comparison of the color variability in the same source at different jet states. Using the slope of the color variability diagram, we propose that the existing dichotomy between FSRQ (redder when brighter) and BLL (bluer when brighter) color variability be reconsidered as a continuum of jet (versus disk) activity, in which blazars can achieve either color variability response depending on jet power. This allows a self-consistent description of the changes in OIR color variability in the same source over time, as well as the OIR color variability in a sample of blazars over time. The second topic of the dissertation is the emission line variability properties of a sample of 7 blazars. We compare the emission line variability with Fermi gamma-ray flux and optical linear polarized flux to estimate its relationship to jet activity. In general, the emission line fluxes are much less variable than the continuum; 4 of the 7 sources had no emission line variability over ~5 year timescales. This implies that the variability in the jet and in the disk are relatively independent and that the jet emission is likely caused by internal processes, rather than increased accretion. However, 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0454-234 showed statistically significant emission line variability, with a mean line flare significance of ~ 4sigma, in close temporal proximity to Fermi gamma-ray flares. While 3C 454.3 and PKS 1510-089 are the two brightest Fermi gamma-ray flaring blazars, we use the peak Fermi gamma-ray flux in PKS 0454-234 to suggest a threshold gamma-ray flux, above which the jet is depositing enough energy in the broad line region to appreciably increase the photoionizing flux seen by the broad line region; below this threshold gamma-ray flux the jet is either not producing enough photoionizing flux to sufficiently energize the broad line region or the jet emitting region is outside of the broad line region., Relativistic jets in blazars produce radio through gamma-ray emission, via synchrotron radiation at long wavelengths and inverse Compton scattering at gamma-ray energies. Variability across these wavelengths allows us to estimate the densities and energies of the radiating particles. Yet, the physics of blazar jets is still uncertain; e.g., it is not clear whether the gamma-rays come from sub- or kilo-parsec scales. The unprecedented temporal and spectral sensitivity of the Fermi Space Telescope has ushered in a new era of discovery and over the past 5 years I have obtained queue-scheduled, nightly optical-infrared (OIR) photometry and bi-weekly optical spectroscopy using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3m+Andicam and 1.5m+RCSpec, in Cerro Tololo, Chile; totaling ~70 gamma-ray bright blazars that are detected nightly with Fermi. In my dissertation, I analyze 5 years of bi-monthly spectroscopy of 6 blazars. I find that the broad lines - which are presumably photoionized by the accretion disk - vary substantially less than the OIR continuum, which is dominated by the Doppler-beamed jet. However, during the largest gamma-ray flares in 3C 454.3 and PKS 1510-089, I see significant broad emission line variations, with lags on the order days and infer that the jet, in its brightest state, contributes significantly to photoionizing the broad-line clouds, meaning the gamma-emitting region is within the broad line region at sub-parsec scales. These variations are not seen at lower gamma-ray fluxes or in any other blazars we observed. I also describe inferences about the jet physics obtained from the SMARTS OIR photometry, which is well correlated with the gamma-ray flux for 11 blazars, with lags of less than one day, strongly supporting the inverse Compton model for gamma-ray production. In addition, color changes in the OIR constrain the ratio of thermal disk to non-thermal jet emission. The color evolution differs by source and also in a given source over timescales of years. In summary, the results of this dissertation provide strong constraints on the location of the gamma-emitting region and the spectral evolution of flaring blazars on short and long timescales., We present multi-epoch optical observations of the blazar 3C 454.3 (z = 0.859) from 2008 August through 2011 December, using the Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope System Consortium 1.5 m + RCSpectrograph and 1.3 m + ANDICAM in Cerro Tololo, Chile. The spectra reveal that the broad emission lines Mg II, Hβ, and Hγ are far less variable than the optical or γ-ray continuum. Although the γ-rays varied by a factor of 100 above the EGRET era flux, the lines generally vary by a factor of two or less. Smaller variations in the γ-ray flux did not produce significant variation in any of the observed emission lines. Therefore, to first order, the ionizing flux from the disk changes only slowly during large variations of the jet. However, two exceptions in the response of the broad emission lines are reported during the largest γ-ray flares in 2009 December and 2010 November, when significant deviations from the mean line flux in Hγ and Mg II were observed. Hγ showed a maximum 3σ and 4σ deviation in each flare, respectively, corresponding to a factor of 1.7 and 2.5 increase in flux. Mg II showed a 2σ deviation in both flares; no variation was detected in Hβ during either flare. These significant deviations from the mean line flux also coincide with 7 mm core ejections reported previously (Jorstad et al.). The correlation of the increased emission line flux with millimeter core ejections and γ-ray, optical, and ultraviolet flares suggests that the broad-line region extends beyond the γ-emitting region during the 2009 and 2010 flares., Recently, we observed an optical brightening in blazar PKS 2326-502 of delta R = 1.32 mag from JD 245519.8 (UTC 2013 August 15) to 2456534.8 (UTC 2013 August 30); fainter than the previous SMARTS maximum (R = 15.86) on 2456108.5 (UTC 2012 June 30). We report R=16.47 on JD 2456534.8 under photometric conditions. R-band optical photometry is calibrated to Landolt standards in the field. The photometric errors are dominated by calibration errors to those stars; the random errors are approximately 0.03 mags in optical., Recently, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope reported a GeV flare from a source positionally consistent with PKS 0250-225 (ATel #4574). As a part of our optical/IR blazar monitoring campaign with the SMARTS telescopes located at Cerro Tololo in Chile, we observe blazars reported to be in a high flux state by Fermi. PKS 0250-225 was observed with SMARTS 1.3m and ANDICAM instrument on UTC 16 November 2012 (JD 2456247.65) in photometric conditions., We report ongoing spectroscopic observations of 3C 454.3 using the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System SMARTS 1.5m telescope + RC Spectrograph located at Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Spectra have been obtained roughly every 14 days from August 2008 through January 2011, during which 3C 454.3 has undergone several prominent optical (and γ-ray) flares. We find that while the equivalent width (EW) of 3C 454.3 varies, the line flux remains constant. This result suggests that the Broad Line Region is photoionized by the slowly varying accretion disk rather than radiation from the relativistic jet. We find the strength of the MgII line to be consistent with a constant line flux of ∼ 2.0× 10<SUP>-14</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> A<SUP>-1</SUP>. This constant line flux argues against the photoionization of the BLR from the relativistic jet, as this source has undergone a number of flares during the course of observation with no corresponding change in line flux. This finding also implies that accretion disk is non-variable on timescales of at least 2.5 years., J. Isler, Fisk University; K. van der Heyden and B. A. Bassett, South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO); L.-G. Strolger, Western Kentucky University; and R. A. Knop, Vanderbilt University, report that a spectrum (range 420-700 nm) of 2007ft (cf. CBET 1004), obtained on July 17.79 UT with the SAAO Radcliffe 1.9-m telescope (+ CCD with grating spectrograph), shows it to be a type-Ia supernova within 1 day of maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra indicates that 2007ft is similar to the type-Ia supernova 1986G. Removing the NED recession velocity of 3107 km/s for the host galaxy, the minimum of the 635.5-nm Si II absorption is blueshifted by roughly 10500 km/s., We characterize the metallicity [Fe/H] distribution of red giant branch (RGB) stars in the extended bulge of Andromeda spiral galaxy (M31) using spectroscopic and photometric data acquired with the Keck II 10-m telescope/DEIMOS spectrograph, CFHT 3.6-m telescope/ MegaCam camera, and the KPNO 4-m telescope/Mosaic camera. Our study is based on several hundred spectroscopically confirmed M31 RGB stars located in fields that lie in the projected distance range R = 10 - 30 kpc from M31's center along the minor axis. We measure the [Fe/H] distribution of M31's extended Sersic (n = 2) bulge by statistically subtracting the contribution of the underlying R<SUP>-2.6</SUP> power-law metal-poor stellar halo that extends out to R = 165 kpc. This study extends the initial finding by Kalirai et al. (2006) of a radial metallicity gradient in M31’s bulge + halo.

Panelists will share a diverse perspective on engaging undergraduate students in research and discuss ongoing programs including 1) The Astronomical and Planetary Sciences online degree program at ASU has created several online research opportunities for students including online CURE and group-based research experiences along with coordinating in-person laboratory experiences. To serve both on campus and online students, the School of Earth and Space Exploration is creating a system to help our 700 undergraduates navigate finding research opportunities appropriate for their background and interests. 2) More about the development and future assessment of the first ever course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for online astronomy majors. Students in this course learn about exoplanet transits, work with Exoplanet Watch in order to update the ephemerides of a Hot Jupiter, and collaboratively write a short paper to submit for publication. 3) TIMESTEP is a personal and professional development program for undergraduate students at the University of Arizona, designed to increase retention and graduation among minoritized students by strengthening their technical skills, STEM identity, and ability to navigate and persist in their degree. TIMESTEP is open to all students, regardless of identity, serving approximately 100 students each year, half of whom are from populations historically excluded from STEM fields. Most students participating are majoring in astronomy, physics, and/or mathematics. Weekly meetings throughout the school year focus on support for incoming students, grad school applications, obtaining research positions, exploring industry career paths, applying for internships, and engaging with diverse mentors. TIMESTEP also includes both a research apprenticeship program with faculty during the academic year and a summer internship program with local tech companies., Now in its third year, the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University has a 100% online undergraduate degree in Astronomical and Planetary Sciences. This degree is one of the world's first online astronomy Bachelor of Science degrees. Offered through ASU Online, this innovative degree will prepare students for many careers including K-12 STEM teachers, technology and science journalism and writing, public outreach, science communication officer, science policy, statistical data analysis, and computer programming. The degree program includes groundwork in mathematics and physical sciences, topical courses focused on diverse fields within astronomy and planetary science, and exposure to the engineering and computational tools and techniques used to carry out research. Students who are interested in going to graduate school in Astrophysics would need additional advanced coursework, including upper-level math and physics courses some of which are now offered through ASU Online. <P />We have developed new online courses and redesigned existing ones in support of this degree. By utilizing innovative learning techniques and technologies for the online realm, we are able to provide an interactive experience for online students. Our existing online introductory astronomy course, also taken by many non-majors, has been redesigned and features new online adaptive and interactive laboratory experiences created with the ASU Center of Education through eXploration (ETX). Project-based courses include the topics of Science Communication and Problem Solving and Programming using Python. Solving the problems of collaborative group work in online upper division courses has benefited from piloting new tools and technology in remotely taught in-person courses during the pandemic. We have begun providing research opportunities for our online students including remote and short on-campus experiences. Currently, approximately 300 students in our degree program are enrolled in courses this semester and interest in the program continues to rise., In Fall 2020, the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University began its 100% online undergraduate degree in Astronomical and Planetary Sciences.

The solar system-based lecture AST 111 and companion lab course AST 113 have been taught online since ∼2009. In that time, the laboratory course has evolved from using existing publisher content to activities we developed for use in Blackboard/Canvas to a hybrid of both systems. Currently, the online AST 113 lab uses several sources: Cengage Virtual Astronomy Labs, Stellarium, Infiniscope activities, our own Canvas activities, and newly developed labs with the Center for Education through eXploration (ETX). <P />In contrast to some of the previously designed ""cookbook""-style lab exercises, the strategy of Infiniscope activities is to provide an experience where the students explore and discover the content for themselves. The Infiniscope project was created by ASU's School of Earth and Space Exploration and NASA's Science Mission Directorate as part of the NASA Exploration Connection project. As part of this project, online activities on topics such as asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects, eclipses, phases of the Moon, and Kepler's Laws were designed and created for middle school (grades 6-8) and informal education settings. <P />Working with the ETX at ASU, we have been developing interactive labs using an adaptive learning strategy. ETX has recently upgraded the successful Habitable Worlds course at ASU that utilizes the same interactive and adaptive strategies throughout the entire suite of lessons. While we do not yet have an entirely adaptive learning path for our online introductory astronomy courses, we are creating new online labs to replace a number of our ""cookbook""-style lab exercises using adaptive learning pathways., In Fall 2020, the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University began its 100% online undergraduate degree in Astronomical and Planetary Sciences.

In the 4 months since our launch in June 2020, over 100 students have been accepted into our degree program with numbers steadily increasing each week., Developing Interactive, Adaptive Labs for an Online Astronomy Course for Non-Science Majors With the growth of online astronomy courses, it has become necessary to design different strategies for students to engage meaningfully with astronomy content. In contrast to some of the previously designed ""cookbook""-style lab exercises, the strategy of these interactive and adaptive activities is to provide an experience where the students explore and discover the content for themselves. Working with the Center for Education through eXploration (ETX) at Arizona State University (ASU), we have been developing interactive labs using an adaptive learning strategy. ETX has recently finished an upgrade of the successful Habitable Worlds course at ASU that utilizes the same interactive and adaptive strategies throughout the entire suite of lessons. While we are not yet changing to an entirely adaptive learning course for our online introductory astronomy courses, we are creating new online labs to replace a number of our ""cookbook""-style lab exercises. These new astronomy labs cover topics including Telescopes, Airless Worlds, Dust and Extinction, and Galaxy Classification. While the first deployment of these labs is expected for Fall 2020, this talk will present the strategies of development and an early look at the labs., While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, equal mass galaxy mergers are relatively rare compared to minor mergers (mass ratio &lt;0.3). Minor mergers are less energetic than major mergers, but more common in the observable universe, and thus likely played a pivotal role in the formation of most large galaxies. Tidal debris regions have large amounts of neutral gas but a lower gas density and may have higher turbulence. We use star formation tracers such as young star cluster populations and H-alpha and CII emission to determine the different factors that may influence star formation in tidal debris. These tracers were compared to the reservoirs of molecular and neutral gas available for star formation to estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE). The SFR in tidal debris can reach up to 50% of the total star formation in the system. The SFE of tidal tails in minor mergers can range over orders of magnitude on both local and global scales, and include several star forming regions with higher than normal SFE. From the tidal debris environments in our study, this variance appears to stem from the formation conditions of the debris. New results of more distant galaxies from the first survey of molecular hydrogen in minor merger tidal debris will be presented. Current surveys of the 2.12 micron line of molecular hydrogen, CO(1-0), and HI for 15 minor mergers, are providing a larger sample of environments to study the threshold for star formation that can inform star formation models, particularly at low densities., The astronomy outreach initiative, Multicultural Milky Way, partners the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State University with under-served populations in Arizona in learning about our Milky Way and other galaxies. Arizona is home to many diverse populations with rich cultural histories such as Maya, Navajo, and Apache. Linking astronomy practiced by one's indigenous culture to that of Western astronomy may increase the interest in science. Through multicultural planetarium shows and associated hands-on activities, under-served students and families will learn how the Milky Way is represented in different cultures and about the science of galaxies. New planetarium shows using the Mesa Community College Digital Planetarium and STARLAB portable planetarium explore how the Milky Way is interpreted in different cultures. STARLAB shows and associated new hands-on activities have been featured during school visits, teacher trainings, and Community Astronomy Nights around Arizona. A website with resources including scripts and activities will be presented. For authentic assessment, evaluation techniques and procedures were developed., While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, equal mass galaxy mergers are relatively rare compared to minor mergers (mass ratio &lt;0.3).

This poster discusses adapting these activities to the undergraduate non-science major setting. In fall 2017, the Infiniscope activities, such as Small Worlds and Kepler’s Laws, will be incorporated into an Arizona State University online astronomy course, AST 113, which is the laboratory component for the Introduction to Solar System Astronomy course sequence. This course typically enrolls about 800-900 students per semester with a combination of students who are online only as well as those who also take in person classes. In this type of class, we cannot have any in-person required sessions and all content must be delivered online asynchronously. The use of the Infiniscope exploratory exercises will provide students with the ability to use NASA data in a hands-on manner to discover the solar system for themselves., While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, equal mass galaxy mergers are relatively rare compared to minor mergers (mass ratio &lt;0.3). Minor mergers are less energetic than major mergers, but more common in the observable universe, and thus likely played a pivotal role in the formation of most large galaxies. Tidal debris regions have large amounts of neutral gas but a lower gas density and may have higher turbulence. We use star formation tracers such as young star cluster populations and H-alpha and CII emission to determine the different factors that may influence star formation in tidal debris. These tracers were compared to the reservoirs of molecular and neutral gas available for star formation to estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE). The SFR in tidal debris can reach up to 50% of the total star formation in the system. The SFE of tidal tails in minor mergers can range over orders of magnitude on both local and global scales, and include several star forming regions with higher than normal SFE. From the tidal debris environments in our study, this variance appears to stem from the formation conditions of the debris. New results from the first survey of molecular hydrogen in minor merger tidal debris will be presented. Current surveys of the 2.12 micron line of molecular hydrogen, CO(1-0), and HI for 15 minor mergers, are providing a larger sample of environments to study the threshold for star formation that can inform star formation models, particularly at low densities., The astronomy outreach initiative, Multicultural Milky Way, partners the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) at Arizona State University (ASU) with under-served populations in Arizona in learning about our Milky Way and other galaxies. Arizona is home to many diverse populations with rich cultural histories such as Mayan, Navajo, and Apache. Linking astronomy practiced by one’s indigenous culture to that of Western astronomy may increase the interest in science. Through multicultural planetarium shows and associated hands-on activities, under-served students and families will learn how the Milky Way is represented in different cultures and about the science of galaxies. New planetarium shows using the Mesa Community College (MCC) Digital Planetarium and STARLAB portable planetarium explore how the Milky Way is interpreted in different cultures. STARLAB shows and associated new hands-on activities have been featured during school visits, teacher trainings, and Community Astronomy Nights around Arizona. For authentic assessment, evaluation techniques and procedures were developed., , The AAS Working Group on Accessibility and Disability (WGAD) was formed in January of 2016 with the express purpose of seeking equity of opportunity and building inclusive practices for disabled astronomers at all educational and career stages. In this presentation, we will provide a summary of current activities, focusing on developing best practices for accessibility with respect to astronomical databases, publications, and meetings. Due to the reliance of space sciences on databases, it is important to have user centered design systems for data retrieval. The cognitive overload that may be experienced by users of current databases may be mitigated by use of multi-modal interfaces such as xSonify. Such interfaces would be in parallel or outside the original database and would not require additional software efforts from the original database. WGAD is partnering with the IAU Commission C1 WG Astronomy for Equity and Inclusion to develop such accessibility tools for databases and methods for user testing. To collect data on astronomical conference and meeting accessibility considerations, WGAD solicited feedback from January AAS attendees via a web form. These data, together with upcoming input from the community and analysis of accessibility documents of similar conferences, will be used to create a meeting accessibility document. Additionally, we will update the progress of journal access guidelines and our social media presence via Twitter. We recommend that astronomical journals form committees to evaluate the accessibility of their publications by performing user-centered usability studies., While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, equal mass galaxy mergers are relatively rare compared to minor mergers (mass ratio &lt;0.3).Minor mergers are less energetic than major mergers, but more common in the observable universe, and thus likely played a pivotal role in the formation of most large galaxies.

These tracers were compared to the reservoirs of gas available for star formation to estimate the star formation efficiency (SFE). In our pilot study using two of the sample of 15 minor mergers, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) of minor merger tidal debris can reach up to 50% of the total star formation in the system which is comparable to prior simulations of star formation in major mergers. The SFE of tidal tails in minor mergers can range over orders of magnitude on both local and global scales. From the tidal debris environments in this study, this variance appears to stem from the formation conditions of the debris. Further work on the 13 additional minor mergers in this sample will shed more light on the factors influencing star formation in low density environments., Learning science in a community is important for children of all levels and especially for many underserved populations. This project combines HST research of galaxy evolution using gravitationally lensed galaxies with hands-on activities and the Starlab portable planetarium to link astronomy with families, teachers, and students. To explore galaxy evolution, new activities were developed and evaluated using novel evaluation techniques. A new set of galaxy classification cards enable inquiry-based learning about galaxy ages, evolution, and gravitational lensing. Activities using new cylinder overlays for the Starlab transparent cylinder will enable the detailed examination of star formation and galaxy evolution as seen from the viewpoint inside of different types of galaxies. These activities were presented in several Arizona venues that enable family and student participation including ASU Earth and Space Open House, Arizona Museum of Natural History Homeschooling Events, on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and inner city Phoenix schools serving mainly Hispanic populations. Additional events targeted underserved families at the Phoenix Zoo, in Navajo County, and for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. After evaluation, the activities and materials will also be shared with local teachers and nationally., While major mergers and their tidal debris are well studied, they are less common than minor mergers and likely played a role in forming most large galaxies, including the Milky Way.

A large survey with TMT as well as the continuing programs of ALMA and the EVLA can provide a larger sample of environments to study the threshold for star formation and can inform star formation models, particularly at low densities., The peculiar spiral NGC 2782 is the result of a minor merger with a mass ratio ~4: 1 occurring ~200 Myr ago. This merger produced a molecular and H I-rich, optically bright eastern tail and an H I-rich, optically faint western tail. Non-detection of CO in the western tail by Braine et al. suggested that star formation had not yet begun. However, deep UBVR and Hα narrowband images show evidence of recent star formation in the western tail, though it lacks massive star clusters and cluster complexes. Using Herschel PACS spectroscopy, we discover 158 μm [C II] emission at the location of the three most luminous Hα sources in the eastern tail, but not at the location of the even brighter Hα source in the western tail. The western tail is found to have a normal star formation efficiency (SFE), but the eastern tail has a low SFE. The lack of CO and [C II] emission suggests that the western tail H II region may have a low carbon abundance and be undergoing its first star formation. The western tail is more efficient at forming stars, but lacks massive clusters. We propose that the low SFE in the eastern tail may be due to its formation as a splash region where gas heating is important even though it has sufficient molecular and neutral gas to make massive star clusters. The western tail, which has lower gas surface density and does not form high-mass star clusters, is a tidally formed region where gravitational compression likely enhances star formation. <P />Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA., This work examines star formation in the debris associated with collisions of dwarf and spiral galaxies. While the spectacular displays of major mergers are famous (e.g., NGC 4038/9, ""The Antennae''), equal mass galaxy mergers are relatively rare compared to minor mergers (mass ratio &lt;0.3) Minor mergers are less energetic than major mergers, but more common in the observable universe and, thus, likely played a pivotal role in the formation of most large galaxies. Centers of mergers host vigorous star formation from high gas density and turbulence and are surveyed over cosmological distances. However, the tidal debris resulting from these mergers have not been well studied. Such regions have large reservoirs of gaseous material that can be used as fuel for subsequent star formation but also have lower gas density. Tracers of star formation at the local and global scale have been examined for three tidal tails in two minor merger systems. These tracers include young star cluster populations, H-alpha, and [","['2024ASPC..537...14K', '2023AAS...24117105K', '2022ASPC..533..192K', '2022AAS...24024212K', '2021ASPC..531..205K', '2021AAS...23732301K', '2020AAS...23525209K', '2020AAS...23534505K', '2019AAS...23314703K', '2019AAS...23314422K', '2018AAS...23125604K', '2018AAS...23114915K', '2018AAS...23136003K', '2017lota.confE..25K', '2017AAS...23011601K', '2017AAS...23021406K', '2017AAS...22934324K', '2016AAS...22724016K', '2016AAS...22724611K', '2014tmt..confE..51K', '2013arXiv1307.7767K', '10.48550/arXiv.1307.7767', 'arXiv:1307.7767', '10.1088/0004-637X/774/2/125', '2013ApJ...774..125K', '2013PhDT........50K', '2013PhDT.......665K', '2013AAS...22144102K', '2013PhDT.......679K', '2012arXiv1205.1553K', '10.1088/2041-8205/749/1/L1', '10.48550/arXiv.1205.1553', '2012ApJ...749L...1K', 'arXiv:1205.1553', '2010hers.prop..766K', '2010ASPC..423..342K', '10.48550/arXiv.0909.2053', 'arXiv:0909.2053', '2009arXiv0909.2053K', '2007hst..prop11134K', '2007iuse.book..307K', '10.1007/978-1-4020-5573-7_52', '2007ASSP....3..307K', '2006AAS...20924404K', '2006BAAS...38R1231K', '2005BAAS...37.1375K', '2005AAS...20712818K', '2005BAAS...37.1263K', '2005AAS...207.6702K', '2004ASPC..322...59K', 'arXiv:astro-ph/0307383', '10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0307383', '2003astro.ph..7383K', '10.1086/377481', '2003AJ....126.1227K']","[('star', 141), ('formation', 108), ('merger', 104), ('tidal', 95), ('tail', 95), ('debris', 70), ('online', 64), ('cluster', 61), ('galaxy', 60), ('gas', 55)]","[(('star', 'formation'), 85), (('tidal', 'debris'), 62), (('minor', 'merger'), 52), (('star', 'cluster'), 43), (('western', 'tail'), 35), (('tidal', 'tail'), 25), (('major', 'merger'), 22), (('mass', 'ratio'), 19), (('merger', 'mass'), 15), (('young', 'star'), 15)]","[(('minor', 'mergers', 'mass'), 12), (('star', 'formation', 'tidal'), 12), (('star', 'formation', 'efficiency'), 12), (('school', 'earth', 'space'), 10), (('earth', 'space', 'exploration'), 10), (('formation', 'tidal', 'debris'), 10), (('formation', 'efficiency', 'sfe'), 10), (('arizona', 'state', 'university'), 9), (('major', 'mergers', 'tidal'), 9), (('mergers', 'tidal', 'debris'), 9)]",Dirty

A popular such model is f(R) gravity, in which the Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by a general function of it. We study the f(R) model of Hu &amp; Sawicki, which recovers standard general relativity in high-density regimes, while reproducing the desired late time acceleration at cosmological scales. We run a suite of high-resolution zoom simulations using the ECOSMOG code to examine the effect of f(R) gravity on the properties of a halo that is analogous to the Virgo cluster. We show that the velocity dispersion profiles can potentially discriminate between f(R) models and ΛCDM, and provide complementary analysis of lensing signal profiles to explore the possibility to further distinguish the different f(R) models. Our results confirm the techniques explored by Cabré et al. to quantify the effect of environment in the behaviour of f(R) gravity, and we extend them to study halo satellites at various redshifts. We find that the modified gravity effects in our models are most observable at low redshifts, and that effects are generally stronger for satellites far from the centre of the main halo. We show that the screening properties of halo satellites trace very well that of dark matter particles, which means that low-resolution simulations in which subhaloes are not very well resolved can in principle be used to study satellite properties. We discuss observables, particularly for halo satellites, that can potentially be used to constrain the observational viability of f(R) gravity.","['2015MNRAS.448..307C', '2015MNRAS.448..307M', '10.1093/mnras/stu2757']","[('model', 6), ('gravity', 6), ('halo', 5), ('satellite', 5), ('effect', 4), ('study', 3), ('property', 3), ('modified', 2), ('dark', 2), ('matter', 2)]","[(('halo', 'satellite'), 3), (('modified', 'gravity'), 2), (('dark', 'matter'), 2), (('late', 'time'), 2), (('time', 'acceleration'), 2), (('property', 'halo'), 2), (('model', 'modified'), 1), (('gravity', 'offer'), 1), (('offer', 'promising'), 1), (('promising', 'alternative'), 1)]","[(('late', 'time', 'acceleration'), 2), (('models', 'modified', 'gravity'), 1), (('modified', 'gravity', 'offer'), 1), (('gravity', 'offer', 'promising'), 1), (('offer', 'promising', 'alternatives'), 1), (('promising', 'alternatives', 'concordance'), 1), (('alternatives', 'concordance', 'cold'), 1), (('concordance', 'cold', 'dark'), 1), (('cold', 'dark', 'matter'), 1), (('dark', 'matter', 'cdm'), 1)]",Dirty

We review the WWT ecosystem, how WWT has been used in the astronomical community, and comment on future directions., We present a framework to simultaneously constrain the values and uncertainties of the strength of convective core overshooting, metallicity, extinction, distance, and age in stellar populations. We then apply the framework to archival Hubble Space Telescope observations of six stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud that have reported ages between ∼ 1{--}2.5 {Gyr}. Assuming a canonical value of the strength of core convective overshooting, we recover the well-known age-metallicity correlation, and additional correlations between metallicity and extinction and metallicity and distance. If we allow the strength of core overshooting to vary, we find that for intermediate-aged stellar clusters, the measured values of distance and extinction are negligibly effected by uncertainties of core overshooting strength. However, cluster age and metallicity may have disconcertingly large systematic shifts when {{{Λ }}}<SUB>{{c</SUB>}} is allowed to vary by more than +/- 0.05 {H}<SUB>p</SUB>. Using the six stellar clusters, we combine their posterior distribution functions to obtain the most probable core overshooting value, {0.500}<SUB>-0.134</SUB><SUP>+0.016</SUP>{H}<SUB>p</SUB>, which is in line with canonical values., Stellar evolution models are fundamental to nearly all studies in astrophysics. They are used to interpret spectral energy distributions of distant galaxies, to derive the star formation histories of nearby galaxies, and to understand fundamental parameters of exoplanets. Despite the success in using stellar evolution models, some important aspects of stellar evolution remain poorly constrained and their uncertainties rarely addressed. We present results using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations of 10 stellar clusters in the Magellanic Clouds to simultaneously constrain the values and uncertainties of the strength of core convective overshooting, metallicity, interstellar extinction, cluster distance, binary fraction, and age., Thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars are relatively short lived (less than a few Myr), yet their cool effective temperatures, high luminosities, efficient mass loss, and dust production can dramatically affect the chemical enrichment histories and the spectral energy distributions of their host galaxies. The ability to accurately model TP-AGB stars is critical to the interpretation of the integrated light of distant galaxies, especially in redder wavelengths. We continue previous efforts to constrain the evolution and lifetimes of TP-AGB stars by modeling their underlying stellar populations. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and near-infrared photometry taken of 12 fields of 10 nearby galaxies imaged via the Advanced Camera for Surveys Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury and the near-infrared HST/SNAP follow-up campaign, we compare the model and observed TP-AGB luminosity functions as well as the ratio of TP-AGB to red giant branch stars. We confirm the best-fitting mass-loss prescription, introduced by Rosenfield et al., in which two different wind regimes are active during the TP-AGB, significantly improves models of many galaxies that show evidence of recent star formation. This study extends previous efforts to constrain TP-AGB lifetimes to metallicities ranging -1.59 ≲ {{[Fe/H]}} ≲ -0.56 and initial TP-AGB masses up to ∼4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which include TP-AGB stars that undergo hot-bottom burning. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., The evolution and lifetimes of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars suffer from significant uncertainties. We present a detailed framework for constraining model luminosity functions of TP-AGB stars using resolved stellar populations. We show an example of this method that compares various TP-AGB mass-loss prescriptions that differ in their treatments of mass loss before the onset of dust-driven winds (pre-dust). We find that models with more efficient pre-dust driven mass loss produce results consistent with observations, as opposed to more canonical mass-loss models. Efficient pre-dust driven mass-loss predicts, for [Fe/H] ≲ -1.2, that lower mass TP-AGB stars (M≲ 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) must have lifetimes less than about 1.2 Myr., Resolved stellar populations in galaxies are excellent laboratories for testing our understanding of galaxy formation, integrated colors and luminosities, supernova progenitor masses, and energy input from stellar feedback. However, the usefulness of resolved stellar populations rests on the ability to accurately model the evolution of the underlying stars. Part of my thesis work is focused on two uncertain phases of stellar evolution; the luminous core helium burning (HeB) phase and the thermally pulsating AGB (TP-AGB) phase. Dwarf galaxies, imaged as part of the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury and its HST/NIR follow-up campaign, provide ideal testing grounds for new models because the galaxies span ~2 dex in metallicity, many have significant HeB populations (i.e, the HeB sequence is populated with stars with masses from ~2-15 Msun), and many contain large numbers of TP-AGB stars. I will present how I used ANGST to constrain low metallicity stellar evolution models with the Padova-Trieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC; the recently updated Padova Stellar Evolution Library) and COLIBRI (a new tool for modeling TP-AGB stars). Specifically, I will show how increasing the strength of core overshooting with increasing mass in HeB stars improves data and model agreement. I will also present constraints to the mass loss prescriptions of low mass, low metallicity TP-AGB stars., We aim to use HST observations of M31 to generate the definitive data set for modeling the population of the UV-bright stars that contribute to the UV flux in old stellar populations (i.e., the ""UV excess"" seen in some elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges).We propose to place stringent observational constraints on the post-AGB (P-AGB) and post-early AGB (PE-AGB) phases of stellar evolution using a UV survey of M31's bulge. M31 is a critical laboratory for testing these models, as it hosts an old, metal-rich stellar population with high stellar densities such that even rare evolutionary phases are well-represented.We will (1) assemble a catalog of UV-bright stars in the center of M31 in F336W and F225W, extending out to ~0.7 kpc, to sample stellar populations with different metallicities; and (2) image a smaller 0.9 sqr-arcmin strip with ACS/SBC in F140LP, to image the regions with the highest density of rapidly-evolving P-AGB stars. The FUV imaging will allow us to separate the P-AGB from the PE-AGB. These observations will include thousands of UV-bright stars, increasing the size of existing samples by orders of magnitude.These new observations will drive revisions in models for post-HB evolution, which we will merge into new isochrone libraries and stellar population synthesis codes. The revisions will have important implications for AGB evolution, spectral evolution models of galaxies, and for mass loss on the RGB. The observations will also have a direct impact on interpreting (1) the UV flux from old stellar populations; (2) the emission line flux from M31's nuclear spiral; and (3) models of dust heating by old stellar populations., The University of Washington mobile planetarium project is a student-driven effort to bring astronomy to secondary schools, and the community, in Seattle, USA. This paper presents the solution that was designed and built in order to use the World- Wide Telescope — a computer program created by Microsoft that displays the astronomical sky as maps, the 3D Universe, and earth science data — from a laptop and an off-the-shelf high-definition (HD) projector located in an inflatable plane- tarium. In the first six months of operation, undergraduates at the University of Washington presented planetarium shows to over 1500 people, and 150 secondary school students created and presented their own astronomy projects in our dome, at their school. This paper aims to share the technical aspects of the project so that others can replicate the model or adapt it to their needs. This project was made possible thanks to a NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope education/public outreach grant., The evolution and lifetimes of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars suffer from significant uncertainties. In this work, we analyze the numbers and luminosity functions of TP-AGB stars in six quiescent, low metallicity ([Fe/H] &lt;~ -0.86) galaxies taken from the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury sample, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry in both optical and near-infrared filters. The galaxies contain over 1000 TP-AGB stars (at least 60 per field). We compare the observed TP-AGB luminosity functions and relative numbers of TP-AGB and red giant branch (RGB) stars, N <SUB>TP-AGB</SUB>/N <SUB>RGB</SUB>, to models generated from different suites of TP-AGB evolutionary tracks after adopting star formation histories derived from the HST deep optical observations. We test various mass-loss prescriptions that differ in their treatments of mass loss before the onset of dust-driven winds (pre-dust). These comparisons confirm that pre-dust mass loss is important, since models that neglect pre-dust mass loss fail to explain the observed N <SUB>TP-AGB</SUB>/N <SUB>RGB</SUB> ratio or the luminosity functions. In contrast, models with more efficient pre-dust mass loss produce results consistent with observations. We find that for [Fe/H] &lt;~ -0.86, lower mass TP-AGB stars (M &lt;~ 1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) must have lifetimes of ~0.5 Myr and higher masses (M &lt;~ 3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) must have lifetimes &lt;~ 1.2 Myr. In addition, assuming our best-fitting mass-loss prescription, we show that the third dredge-up has no significant effect on TP-AGB lifetimes in this mass and metallicity range. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., , Resolved stellar populations in galaxies are excellent laboratories for testing our understanding of galaxy formation, integrated colors and luminosities, supernova progenitor masses, and energy input from stellar feedback. However, the usefulness of resolved stellar populations rests on the ability to accurately model the evolution of the underlying stars.

I will also present constraints to the mass loss prescriptions of low mass, low metallicity TP-AGB stars., Low metallicity massive and intermediate mass stars play a fundamental role in the early evolution of galaxies, as they provide the first metal and dust reservoirs from which subsequent evolution proceeds. However, significant uncertainties remain in modeling these stars which can be especially problematic for evolved phases. We are currently calibrating a new suite of models for the luminous core helium burning (HeB) stars and beyond. During HeB these stars often appear as two distinct sequences on a color magnitude diagram as they are seen to undergo a ""blue loop,"" beginning core helium fusion near the red giant branch, and then becoming hotter (while maintaining approximately constant luminosity) until they nearly coincide with the bright main sequence. Dwarf galaxies from ANGST and ANGRRR are an ideal environment for these new models because they span ~2 dex in metallicity and more than 30 galaxies have significant HeB populations. We will use these surveys to constrain low metallicity stellar evolution models with the Padova-Trieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC; the recently updated Padova Stellar Evolution Library)., Graduate students in the astronomy department at the University of Washington began the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) after recognizing that underrepresented students in STEM fields are not well retained after their transition from high school. Pre-MAP is a research and mentoring program that begins with a keystone seminar. First year students enroll in the Pre-MAP seminar to learn astronomical research techniques that they apply to research projects conducted in small groups. Students also receive one-on-one mentoring and peer support for the duration of the academic year and beyond. They are incorporated early into the department by attending Astronomy Department events and Pre-MAP field trips. Successful Pre-MAP students have declared astronomy and physics majors, expanded their research projects beyond the fall quarter, presented posters at the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium, and received research fellowships and summer internships. In this talk, we will discuss how we identified the issues that Pre-MAP was designed to address, what we've learned after six years of Pre-MAP, and share statistical results from a long-term quantitative comparison evaluation., Resolved stellar populations in galaxies are excellent laboratories for testing our understanding of galaxy formation, integrated colors and luminosities, supernova progenitor masses, and energy input from stellar feedback. However, the usefulness of resolved stellar populations rests on the ability to accurately model the evolution of the underlying stars. In this dissertation, I present three projects, the first uses stellar evolution models of hot post-horizontal branch stars to explain the some of the of excess ultra-violet (UV) flux emitted from the center of the Andromeda galaxy. This flux was imaged as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury HST multi-cycle program, and excess of UV light from the centers of large elliptical galaxies has been well documented. Therefore, the results of this project go beyond stellar evolution and understanding M31. I find that this population of stars are indeed failed AGB stars or left the AGB early. I also find the stars producing the excess UV light are strongly concentrated in the central regions of the M31 bulge, which must shed light on the progenitor stars. The subsequent two projects each constrain uncertain aspects of uncertain phases of stellar evolution using nearby dwarf galaxies from the HST ACS Nearby galaxy Survey Treasury and a follow-up HST/SNAP campaign which imaged a subset of ANGST galaxies in the near infrared. The two uncertain phases of stellar evolution studied are the luminous core Helium burning (HeB) phase and the thermally pulsating AGB phase. Dwarf galaxies from the ANGST are an ideal environment to test new models because they span ~2 dex in metallicity, more than 30 galaxies have significant HeB populations, and we have HST/NIR follow up data for 26 galaxies with a large AGB population. I find that the convection occurring the HeB stars must increase in strength with increasing mass, and I find constrains on the mass loss prescriptions for low metallicity TP-AGB stars from 0.8 -- ~4 stellar masses., We present a preliminary analysis of known planetary nebulae (PNe) in M31 that were observed in the first year of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury HST Multi-cycle program. We use the properties of this sample to discuss PNe from this new multi-band survey., As part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury multi-cycle program, we observed a 12' × 6farcm5 area of the bulge of M31 with the WFC3/UVIS filters F275W and F336W. From these data we have assembled a sample of ~4000 UV-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. We use updated Padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars into three classes: Post-AGB stars (P-AGB), Post-Early AGB (PE-AGB) stars, and AGB-manqué stars. P-AGB stars are the end result of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations, whereas PE-AGB and AGB-manqué (together referred to as the hot post-horizontal branch; HP-HB) stars are the result of insufficient envelope masses to allow a full AGB phase, and are expected to be particularly prominent at high helium or α abundances when the mass loss on the red giant branch is high. Our data support previous claims that most UV-bright sources in the bulge are likely hot (extreme) horizontal branch (EHB) stars and their progeny. We construct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations and show that they are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated UV or optical light. However, we find that this UV-bright population does not dominate the total UV luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting only the progeny of the EHB stars that are the likely source of the UV excess. We calculate that only a few percent of main-sequence stars in the central bulge can have gone through the HP-HB phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance from the center. We also find that the surface density of hot UV-bright stars has the same radial variation as that of low-mass X-ray binaries. We discuss age, metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observed radial variation in the UV-bright population. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555., As part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) multi-cycle program, we observed a 12‧ × 6.5‧ area of the bulge of M31 with the WFC3/UVIS filters F275W and F336W . From these data we have assembled a sample of UV-bright, old stars, vastly larger than previously available. We use updated Padova stellar evolutionary tracks to classify these hot stars into three classes, including Post-AGB stars (P-AGB), Post-Early AGB (PE-AGB) stars and AGB-manque stars. P-AGB stars are the end result of the AGB phase and are expected in a wide range of stellar populations, whereas PE-AGB and AGB-manque (together referred to as hot post-horizontal branch HP-HB) stars are the result of insufficient envelope masses to allow a full AGB phase, and are expected to be particularly prominent at high helium or α abundances when the mass loss on the RGB is high. Our data support previous claims that most UV-bright sources in the bulge are likely hot horizontal branch stars (EHB) and their progeny. We construct the first radial profiles of these stellar populations, and show that they are highly centrally concentrated, even more so than the integrated UV or optical light. However, we find that this UV-bright population does not dominate the total UV luminosity at any radius, as we are detecting the progeny of the EHB stars that are the likely source of the UVX. We calculate that only a few percent of MS stars in the central bulge can have gone through the HP-HB phase and that this percentage decreases strongly with distance from the center. We also find that the surface density of hot UV-bright stars has the same radial variation as that of LMXBs. We discuss age, metallicity, and abundance variations as possible explanations for the observed radial variation in the UV-bright population., The lives and deaths of massive stars are intricately linked to the evolution of galaxies. Yet, despite their integral importance to understanding galaxy evolution, models of massive stars are inconsistent with observations. These uncertainties can be traced to limited observational constraints available for improving massive star models. A sensitive test of the underlying physics of massive stars, e.g., convection, rotation, and mass loss is to measure the ratio of blue core helium burning stars {BHeB} to red core helium burning stars {RHeB}, 5-20Msun stars in the stage evolution immediately following the main sequence. Even the most sophisticated models cannot accurately predict the observed ratio over a range of metallicities, suggesting an insufficient understanding of the underlying physics. However, observational measurements of this ratio over a wide range of environments would provide substantial constraints on the physical parameters governing the evolution of all stars &gt;5 Msun.We propose to place stringent observational constraints on the physics of massive star evolution by uniformly measuring the B/R HeB ratio in a wide range of galaxies. The HST archive contains high quality optical imaging of resolved stellar populations of dozens of nearby galaxies. From the ANGST program, we identified 38 galaxies, spanning 2 dex in metallicity that have significant BHeB and RHeB populations. Using this sample, we will empirically characterize the colors of the BHeB and RHeB sequences as a function of luminosity and metallicity, measure the B/R ratio, and constrain the lifetimes of the BHeB and RHeBs in the Padova stellar evolution models and the Cambridge STARS code., Digital planetariums can provide a broader range of educational experiences than the more classical planetariums that use star-balls. This is because of their ability to project images, content from current research, and the 3-D distribution of the stars and galaxies. While there are hundreds of planetariums in the country, the reason that few of these are fully digital is the cost. In collaboration with Microsoft Research (MSR), we have developed a way to digitize existing planetariums for approximately $40,000 using freely available software. We describe here how off the shelf equipment, together with a WorldWide Telescope client, can provide a rich and truly interactive experience. This will enable students and the public to pan though multi-wavelength full-sky scientific data sets, explore 3-D visualizations of our Solar System (including trajectories of millions of minor planets), near-by stars, and the SDSS galaxy catalog., Now in its fifth year, the Pre-Major in Astronomy Program at the University of Washington has increased the number of underrepresented undergraduate astronomy majors, raised the level of undergraduate research, and expanded the roll of departmental mentoring. We exploit the use of peer instruction, teaching of study skills, accessible research and mentoring, community building events, and professional development training in order to increase retention. We present our supporting materials, techniques, and best-practices to export this successful model to other institutions., We present properties of rotating, fully relativistic neutron stars for equations of state computed in the framework of the density dependent relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock hadron field theory. Particular emphasis is put on the hyperon composition of neutron stars, which changes dramatically with rotational frequency. This may have important consequences for rotational instability modes in rapidly spinning neutron stars, as will be pointed out., Low mass double-lined eclipsing binaries are of general interest because precise masses and radii can be derived for the component stars, and these data can in turn be used to test evolutionary models on the lower main sequence. The low mass double-lined eclipsing binaries GU Boo and TrES-Her0-07621 were observed in several bandpasses from the Mount Laguna Observatory (MLO) 2005 May - June with the goal of obtaining precise light curves that can be used to derive accurate radii. <P />Lopez-Morales &amp; Ribas (2005) present light curves of GU Boo covering both eclipses and radial velocity curves for each component and derive component masses and radii accurate to 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Their light curves were not symmetric about the primary eclipse, and Lopez-Morales &amp; Ribas modelled the asymmetry using two dark spots on the primary. Our light curves of GU Boo from MLO show only a slight asymmetry, which indicates the spotted region is much smaller. The radii we derive for the component stars are consistent with the measurements of Lopez-Morales &amp; Ribas, showing that the presence of large star spots did not lead to any systematic errors in the derived radii. <P />TrES-Her0-07621 was discovered by the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES, e.g. Alonso et al. 2004). Creevey et al. (2005) obtained radial velocity curves for both components and derive component masses and radii accurate to 0.6% and 13%, respectively. The radii are poorly constrained since the light curve presented in Creevey et al. is somewhat noisy. Our light curves from MLO have a high signal-to-noise ratio, but unfortunately only cover the secondary eclipse. We see evidence of a sinusoidal variation in the out-of-eclipse phases (also noted by Creevey et al.). More observations will be needed to cover the primary eclipse and to establish the nature of the out-of-eclipse variation.","['10.48550/arXiv.1801.09119', '2018arXiv180109119R', '2018ApJS..236...22R', 'arXiv:1801.09119', '10.3847/1538-4365/aab776', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa70a2', '2017arXiv170500618R', '2017ApJ...841...69R', 'arXiv:1705.00618', '10.48550/arXiv.1705.00618', '2017AAS...22915426R', 'arXiv:1603.05283', '2016arXiv160305283R', '2016ApJ...822...73R', '10.3847/0004-637X/822/2/73', '10.48550/arXiv.1603.05283', 'arXiv:1411.3125', '2014arXiv1411.3125R', '2015ASPC..497..423R', '10.48550/arXiv.1411.3125', '2015AAS...22522303R', '2014hst..prop13710R', '2014arXiv1404.3302R', 'arXiv:1404.3302', '10.48550/arXiv.1404.3302', '2014CAPJ...15...35R', '2014arXiv1406.0676R', '2014ApJ...790...22R', '10.48550/arXiv.1406.0676', 'arXiv:1406.0676', '10.1088/0004-637X/790/1/22', '2014PhDT.......305R', '2014AAS...22311204R', '2013AAS...22121306R', '2013AAS...22111502R', '2013PhDT.......241R', '2012IAUS..283..275R', '10.1017/S1743921312011088', '10.1088/0004-637X/755/2/131', 'arXiv:1206.4045', '2012ApJ...755..131R', '10.48550/arXiv.1206.4045', '2012arXiv1206.4045R', '2012AAS...21934611R', '2011hst..prop12619R', '2010arXiv1011.0342R', 'arXiv:1011.0342', '10.48550/arXiv.1011.0342', '2011ASPC..443..109R', '2010BAAS...42..508R', '2010AAS...21546616R', '2006AAS...209.9103R', '2006BAAS...38R1027R', '2005AAS...20718606R', '2005BAAS...37.1479R']","[('star', 85), ('agb', 66), ('stellar', 51), ('mass', 45), ('galaxy', 42), ('evolution', 36), ('model', 36), ('population', 32), ('tp', 32), ('uv', 25)]","[(('tp', 'agb'), 32), (('agb', 'star'), 26), (('stellar', 'population'), 20), (('stellar', 'evolution'), 20), (('mass', 'loss'), 20), (('uv', 'bright'), 13), (('space', 'telescope'), 11), (('evolution', 'model'), 9), (('hubble', 'space'), 8), (('nearby', 'galaxy'), 8)]","[(('tp', 'agb', 'stars'), 18), (('hubble', 'space', 'telescope'), 8), (('resolved', 'stellar', 'populations'), 8), (('stellar', 'evolution', 'models'), 7), (('uv', 'bright', 'stars'), 7), (('core', 'helium', 'burning'), 6), (('nearby', 'galaxy', 'survey'), 5), (('galaxy', 'survey', 'treasury'), 5), (('mass', 'loss', 'prescriptions'), 5), (('phases', 'stellar', 'evolution'), 5)]",Dirty

In Paper I, we simulated the evaporation of the hot ISM due to isotropic (possibly saturated) conduction between the ISM and ICM. We found that hot coronae evaporate on ∼ {10}<SUP>2</SUP> {Myr} timescales, significantly shorter than the ∼ {10}<SUP>3</SUP> {Myr} gas loss times due to ram pressure stripping. No tails of stripped gas are formed. This is in tension with the observed ubiquity and implied longevity of compact X-ray coronae and stripped ISM tails, and requires the suppression of evaporation, possibly due to magnetic fields and anisotropic conduction. We perform a series of wind tunnel simulations similar to that in Paper I, now including ISM and ICM magnetic fields. We simulate the effect of anisotropic conduction for a range of extreme magnetic field configurations: parallel and perpendicular to the ICM wind, and continuous and completely disjointed between the ISM and ICM. We find that when conduction is anisotropic, gas loss due to evaporation is severely reduced; the overall gas loss rates with and without anisotropic conduction do not differ by more than 10%-20%. Magnetic fields also prevent stripped tails from evaporating in the ICM by shielding, and providing few pathways for heat transport between the ICM and ISM. The morphology of stripped tails and magnetic fields in the tails and wakes of galaxies are sensitive to the initial magnetic field configuration., Cluster of galaxies are hostile environments. Infalling cluster galaxies are stripped of their dark matter, stars, and hot and cold interstellar medium gas. The ISM, in addition to tidal and ram pressure stripping, can evaporate due to thermal conduction. Gas loss and the subsequent suppression of star formation is not straightforward: magnetic fields in the ISM and ICM shield galaxies and their stripped tails from shear instabilities and conduction, radiative cooling can inhibit gas loss, and feedback from stars and AGN can replenish the ISM. While there is observational evidence that these processes operate, a theoretical understanding of the physics controlling the energy cycle in cluster galaxies remains elusive. Additionally, galaxies have a significant impact on ICM evolution: orbiting galaxies stir up and stretch ICM magnetic field lines, inject turbulence into the ICM via their wakes and g-waves, and infuse metals into the ICM. Quantifying the balance between processes that remove, retain, and replenish the ISM, and the impact of galaxies on the ICM require specialized hydrodynamic simulations of the cluster environment and its galaxies. I will present results from some of these simulations that include ram pressure stripping of galaxies' hot ISM, the effect of magnetic fields on this process, and the effectiveness of isotropic and anisotropic thermal conduction in removing and retaining the ISM. I will also quantify magnetic field amplification and turbulence injection due to orbiting galaxies, and implications for X-ray and radio observations and measurements of galactic coronae, tails, magnetic fields, and turbulence., We simulate the evolution of cluster galaxy hot interstellar medium (ISM) gas that is a result of the effects of ram pressure and thermal conduction in the intracluster medium (ICM). At the density and temperature of the ICM, the mean free paths of ICM electrons are comparable to the sizes of galaxies, therefore electrons can efficiently transport heat that is due to thermal conduction from the hot ICM to the cooler ISM. Galaxies consisting of dark matter halos and hot gas coronae are embedded in an ICM-like “wind tunnel” in our simulations. In this paper, we assume that thermal conduction is isotropic and include the effects of saturation. We find that as heat is transferred from the ICM to the ISM, the cooler denser ISM expands and evaporates. This process is significantly faster than gas loss due to ram pressure stripping; for our standard model galaxy, the evaporation time is 160 Myr, while the ram pressure stripping timescale is 2.5 Gyr. Thermal conduction also suppresses the formation of shear instabilities, and there are no stripped ISM tails since the ISM evaporates before tails can form. Observations of long-lived X-ray emitting coronae and ram pressure stripped X-ray tails in galaxies in group and cluster environments therefore require that thermal conduction is suppressed or offset by some additional physical process. The most likely process is anisotropic thermal conduction that is due to magnetic fields in the ISM and ICM, which we simulate and study in the next paper in this series., We use adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the effect of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of galaxies in the intracluster medium (ICM). Although the magnetic pressure in typical clusters is not strong enough to affect the gas mass loss rate from galaxies, magnetic fields can affect the morphology of stripped galaxies. ICM magnetic fields are draped around orbiting galaxies and aligned with their stripped tails. Magnetic fields suppress shear instabilities at the galaxy-ICM interface, and magnetized tails are smoother and narrower than tails in comparable hydrodynamic simulations in Vijayaraghavan and Ricker. Orbiting galaxies stretch and amplify ICM magnetic fields, amplifying magnetic power spectra on 10-100 kpc scales. Galaxies inject turbulent kinetic energy into the ICM via their turbulent wakes and g-waves. The magnetic energy and kinetic energy in the ICM increase up to 1.5{--}2 {Gyr} of evolution, after which galaxies are stripped of most of their gas, and do not have sufficiently large gaseous cross sections to further amplify magnetic fields and inject turbulent kinetic energy. The increase in turbulent pressure due to galaxy stripping and generation of g-waves results in an increase in the turbulent volume fraction of the ICM. This turbulent kinetic energy is not a significant contributor to the overall ICM energy budget, but greatly impacts the evolution of the ICM magnetic field. Additionally, the effect of galaxies on magnetic fields can potentially be observed in high resolution Faraday rotation measure (RM) maps as small-scale fluctuations in the RM structure., Cluster of galaxies are hostile environments. Infalling cluster galaxies are stripped of their dark matter, stars, and hot and cold interstellar medium gas. The ISM, in addition to tidal and ram pressure stripping, can evaporate due to thermal conduction. Gas loss and the subsequent suppression of star formation is not straightforward: magnetic fields in the ISM and ICM shield galaxies and their stripped tails from shear instabilities and conduction, radiative cooling can inhibit gas loss, and feedback from stars and AGN can replenish the ISM. While there is observational evidence that these processes operate, a theoretical understanding of the physics controlling the energy cycle in cluster galaxies remains elusive. Additionally, galaxies have a significant impact on ICM evolution: orbiting galaxies stir up and stretch ICM magnetic field lines, inject turbulence into the ICM via their wakes and g-waves, and infuse metals into the ICM. Quantifying the balance between processes that remove, retain, and replenish the ISM, and the impact of galaxies on the ICM require specialized hydrodynamic simulations of the cluster environment and its galaxies. I will present results from some of these simulations that include ram pressure stripping of galaxies' hot ISM, the effect of magnetic fields on this process, and the effectiveness of isotropic and anisotropic thermal conduction in removing and retaining the ISM., Galaxies in group and cluster environments are subject to ram pressure stripping by the hot intracluster medium, resulting in gas loss and the eventual suppression of star formation. Recent Chandra observations of galaxies in group and cluster environments show that 60 - 80% of these galaxies have compact (1-4 kpc), hot (~ 1 keV) X-ray coronae centered on their cores. These coronae have survived stripping and evaporation in the cluster, and their long-term survival poses a test of our understanding of the physical processes in the ICM. In this poster, I summarize results from Vijayaraghavan &amp; Ricker (2015), where we simulated the evolution of populations of galaxies and their hot coronal gas in group and cluster environments, and evaluated their detectability with existing and future X-ray catalogs., Galaxy cluster minor mergers play an important role in the evolution of cluster galaxies. Galaxies can be `pre-processed' in group environments, where galaxy-galaxy mergers are more frequent than in massive clusters. Group-cluster mergers themselves can accelerate galaxy transformation processes: during the pericentric passages of infalling groups, galaxy stripping is accelerated and galaxy-galaxy interactions dramatically increase. These infalling galaxies, particularly dwarf galaxies, additionally act as tracers of their host clusters' dynamical histories billions of years after group infall. In this talk, I summarize a series of N-body and hydrodynamical simulations quantifying the effects of group pre-processing and group-cluster mergers on galaxy evolution. I also illustrate the use of early-type dwarf dynamics and phase-space structure in identifying infalling groups. I briefly motivate using combined X-ray and optical cluster catalogs to quantify the stacked coronal emission of cluster galaxies and their dependence on their hosts' dynamical histories. The unprecedented photometric depth of the Frontier Fields in combination with follow-up X-ray surveys and spectroscopic measurements will enable the identification of minor mergers and their remnant substructures, allowing us to quantify their overall effect on galaxy evolution., The discovery of long-lived, ubiquitous, hot galactic coronae in groups and clusters by Chandra poses a challenge to our understanding of galactic ISM survival in harsh environments. These coronae are unique probes of ICM and ISM microphysics, since their survival depends on a delicate balance between external ICM physical processes that can alternatively destroy or replenish these coronae and internal galactic physics that can replenish them. In this talk, I present MHD simulations of the evolution of hot coronae of cosmological populations of galaxies in group and cluster environments. I summarize the effects of external ICM phenomena, like tidal and ram pressure stripping, shielding by magnetic fields, and thermal conduction on the survival of these coronae. I also present synthetic X-ray observations which I use to motivate a stacking analysis on combined optical and X-ray surveys to quantify the effect of the local environment on galactic coronae., The stellar, dark matter, and hot gas halos of galaxies are stripped due to tidal forces and ram pressure in dense group and cluster environments. As a result, these halos are incorporated into the background stellar and dark matter halos and the ICM. I present N-body + hydrodynamical simulations of a cosmologically realistic population of galaxies evolving within isolated, virialized group and cluster halos. I quantify the mass loss rate of the collisionless and hot gas components of galaxy halos as functions of galaxy and host mass, and I illustrate the buildup of the background halo and central galaxy and the corresponding destruction of satellite galaxy halos. The evolution of hot gas halos is particularly dramatic, as stripped gas tails trail their host galaxies in their orbits, form shear instabilities, and can even be detached from their original galaxies. Stacked X-ray observations of surviving galaxy halos can be used to constrain the host properties and dynamical histories of galaxies. The dynamics of satellite galaxies themselves, particularly those of dwarf galaxies, can be used as tracers of their host clusters' merger histories. The phase space structure of these galaxies in particular can be used to detect head-on minor mergers that can otherwise go undetected., Galaxy clusters are harsh environments for their constituent galaxies. A variety of physical processes effective in these dense environments transform gas-rich, spiral, star-forming galaxies to elliptical or spheroidal galaxies with very little gas and therefore minimal star formation. The consequences of these processes are well understood observationally. Galaxies in progressively denser environments have systematically declining star formation rates and gas content. However, a theoretical understanding of of where, when, and how these processes act, and the interplay between the various galaxy transformation mechanisms in clusters remains elusive. In this dissertation, I use numerical simulations of cluster mergers as well as galaxies evolving in quiescent environments to develop a theoretical framework to understand some of the physics of galaxy transformation in cluster environments. Galaxies can be transformed in smaller groups before they are accreted by their eventual massive cluster environments, an effect termed `pre-processing'. Galaxy cluster mergers themselves can accelerate many galaxy transformation mechanisms, including tidal and ram pressure stripping of galaxies and galaxy-galaxy collisions and mergers that result in reassemblies of galaxies' stars and gas. Observationally, cluster mergers have distinct velocity and phase-space signatures depending on the observer's line of sight with respect to the merger direction. Using dark matter only as well as hydrodynamic simulations of cluster mergers with random ensembles of particles tagged with galaxy models, I quantify the effects of cluster mergers on galaxy evolution before, during, and after the mergers. Based on my theoretical predictions of the dynamical signatures of these mergers in combination with galaxy transformation signatures, one can observationally identify remnants of mergers and quantify the effect of the environment on galaxies in dense group and cluster environments. The presence of long-lived, hot X-ray emitting coronae observed in a large fraction of group and cluster galaxies is not well-understood. These coronae are not fully stripped by ram pressure and tidal forces that are efficient in these environments. Theoretically, this is a fascinating and challenging problem that involves understanding and simulating the multitude of physical processes in these dense environments that can remove or replenish galaxies' hot coronae. To solve this problem, I have developed and implemented a robust simulation technique where I simulate the evolution of a realistic cluster environment with a population of galaxies and their gas. With this technique, it is possible to isolate and quantify the importance of the various cluster physical processes for coronal survival. To date, I have performed hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies being ram pressure stripped in quiescent group and cluster environments. Using these simulations, I have characterized the physics of ram pressure stripping and investigated the survival of these coronae in the presence of tidal and ram pressure stripping. I have also generated synthetic X-ray observations of these simulated systems to compare with observed coronae. I have also performed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of galaxies evolving in a magnetized intracluster medium plasma to isolate the effect of magnetic fields on coronal evolution, as well the effect of orbiting galaxies in amplifying magnetic fields. This work is an important step towards understanding the effect of cluster environments on galactic gas, and consequently, their long term evolution and impact on star formation rates., Ram pressure stripping can remove hot and cold gas from galaxies in the intracluster medium, as shown by observations of X-ray and H I galaxy wakes in nearby clusters of galaxies. However, ram pressure stripping, including pre-processing in group environments, does not remove all the hot coronal gas from cluster galaxies. Recent high-resolution Chandra observations have shown that ∼1-4 kpc extended, hot galactic coronae are ubiquitous in group and cluster galaxies. To better understand this result, we simulate ram pressure stripping of a cosmologically motivated population of galaxies in isolated group and cluster environments. The galaxies and the host group and cluster are composed of collisionless dark matter and hot gas initially in hydrostatic equilibrium with the galaxy and host potentials. We show that the rate at which gas is lost depends on the galactic and host halo mass. Using synthetic X-ray observations, we evaluate the detectability of stripped galactic coronae in real observations by stacking images on the known galaxy centres. We find that coronal emission should be detected within ∼10 arcsec, or ∼5 kpc up to ∼2.3 Gyr in the lowest (0.1-1.2 keV) energy band. Thus, the presence of observed coronae in cluster galaxies significantly smaller than the hot X-ray haloes of field galaxies indicates that at least some gas removal occurs within cluster environments for recently accreted galaxies. Finally, we evaluate the possibility that existing and future X-ray cluster catalogues can be used in combination with optical galaxy positions to detect galactic coronal emission via stacking analysis. We briefly discuss the effects of additional physical processes on coronal survival, and will address them in detail in future papers in this series., Observations of early-type dwarf galaxies in clusters often show that cluster dwarf members have significantly higher velocities and less symmetric distributions than cluster giant ellipticals, suggesting that these dwarfs are recently accreted galaxies, possibly from an infalling group. We use a series of N-body simulations, exploring a parameter space of groups falling into clusters, to study the observed velocity distributions of the infall components along various lines of sight. We show that, as viewed along a line of sight parallel to the group's infall direction, there is a significant peculiar velocity boost during the pericentric passage of the group, and an increase in velocity dispersion that persists for many Gyr after the merger. The remnants of the infalling group, however, do not form a spatially distinct system - consistent with recent observations of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax clusters. This velocity signature is completely absent when viewed along a direction perpendicular to the merger. Additionally, the phase-space distribution of radial velocity along the infall direction versus cluster-centric radius reveals the separate dynamical evolution of the group's central core and outer halo, including the presence of infalling remnants outside the escape velocity envelope of the system. The distinct signature in velocity space of an infalling group's galaxies can therefore prove important in understanding the dynamical history of clusters and their dwarfs. Our results suggest that dwarf galaxies, being insensitive to dynamical friction, are excellent probes of their host clusters' dynamical histories., Galaxies in group and cluster environments tend to be gas-poor and lack active star formation in comparison with field galaxies. Some of these differences arise from environmental influences such as ram pressure and tidal stripping. We investigate these influences using N-body simulations of galaxies within idealized group, cluster, and group-cluster merger environments. Using these simulations, we study the velocity distributions and phase-space structure of infalling group galaxies as they virialize within their host cluster and relate them to the observed dynamics of Virgo dwarf elliptical galaxies. We additionally use N-body plus hydrodynamic simulations to study the stripping of hot gaseous coronae from galaxies in groups and clusters. We use these simulations to characterize ram pressure wakes and their dependence on galaxy mass and environmental properties. We also generate mock X-ray observations of the simulated galaxies and use a stacking analysis to evaluate the detectability of the remaining gas., Recent Chandra observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence of hot extended X-ray coronae centered on cluster galaxies. In cluster environments, tidal and ram pressure stripping, along with thermal heat conduction, are expected to remove these coronae. Their survival in these harsh environments is puzzling, and implies the existence of shielding mechanisms like magnetic fields and kinematic viscosity, or replenishment processes, due to stellar and AGN feedback. The goal of our proposal is to model the stripping, shielding, and replenishment in hot galactic coronae using hydrodynamical numerical simulations, and quantify the balance between the various physical phenomena at play., Galaxies in group and cluster environments are gas-poor and have low star formation rates compared to field galaxies. We investigate the mechanisms of gas removal in these environments using idealized high-resolution simulations of populations of galaxies evolving in groups and clusters. We quantify the effects of tidal and ram-pressure stripping as well as galaxy-galaxy interactions on removing gas bound to galaxies. We study these effects in both isolated and merging groups and clusters, and investigate pre-processing of galaxies in group environments before cluster infall. Additionally, we generate mock Chandra X-ray observations from our simulations, and probe the properties of the intra-cluster and intra-group medium using the known properties of ram-pressure stripped galaxy wakes., Galaxies in clusters are more likely to be of early type and to have lower star formation rates than galaxies in the field. Recent observations and simulations suggest that cluster galaxies may be `pre-processed' by group or filament environments and that galaxies that fall into a cluster as part of a larger group can stay coherent within the cluster for up to one orbital period (`post-processing'). We investigate these ideas by means of a cosmological N-body simulation and idealized N-body plus hydrodynamics simulations of a group-cluster merger. We find that group environments can contribute significantly to galaxy pre-processing by means of enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, removal of galaxies' hot halo gas by ram pressure stripping and tidal truncation of their galaxies. Tidal distortion of the group during infall does not contribute to pre-processing. Post-processing is also shown to be effective: galaxy-galaxy collisions are enhanced during a group's pericentric passage within a cluster, the merger shock enhances the ram pressure on group and cluster galaxies and an increase in local density during the merger leads to greater galactic tidal truncation.","['2017ApJ...848...63V', '10.48550/arXiv.1706.00021', '2017arXiv170600021V', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa8bb3', 'arXiv:1706.00021', '2017HEAD...1610509V', 'arXiv:1702.03971', '10.48550/arXiv.1702.03971', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa706d', '2017ApJ...841...22V', '2017arXiv170203971V', '2017arXiv170206138V', '2017ApJ...841...38V', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa6eac', 'arXiv:1702.06138', '10.48550/arXiv.1702.06138', '2017AAS...22934616V', '2016IAUS..317..362V', '10.1017/S1743921315008765', '2015IAUGA..2255791V', '2015IAUGA..2255787V', '2015IAUGA..2255798V', '2015PhDT........83V', '10.5281/zenodo.1036756', '2015MNRAS.449.2312V', 'arXiv:1503.01121', '10.1093/mnras/stv476', '10.48550/arXiv.1503.01121', '2015arXiv150301121V', '10.1093/mnras/stu2761', '2015MNRAS.447.3623V', '10.48550/arXiv.1412.2431', 'arXiv:1412.2431', '2014arXiv1412.2431V', '2015AAS...22532105V', '2014cxo..prop.4562V', '2014xvge.confE..49V', 'arXiv:1308.1311', '2013MNRAS.435.2713V', '10.48550/arXiv.1308.1311', '2013arXiv1308.1311V', '10.1093/mnras/stt1485', '2013MNRAS.tmp.2152V']","[('galaxy', 140), ('cluster', 79), ('group', 47), ('icm', 40), ('gas', 39), ('environment', 38), ('field', 32), ('pressure', 30), ('magnetic', 30), ('hot', 29)]","[(('ram', 'pressure'), 28), (('magnetic', 'field'), 27), (('group', 'cluster'), 25), (('pressure', 'stripping'), 19), (('cluster', 'environment'), 19), (('cluster', 'galaxy'), 18), (('thermal', 'conduction'), 12), (('cluster', 'merger'), 11), (('gas', 'loss'), 9), (('star', 'formation'), 9)]","[(('ram', 'pressure', 'stripping'), 19), (('group', 'cluster', 'environments'), 11), (('tidal', 'ram', 'pressure'), 7), (('galaxies', 'group', 'cluster'), 6), (('anisotropic', 'thermal', 'conduction'), 4), (('pressure', 'stripping', 'galaxies'), 4), (('effect', 'magnetic', 'fields'), 4), (('star', 'formation', 'rates'), 4), (('intracluster', 'medium', 'icm'), 3), (('icm', 'magnetic', 'fields'), 3)]",Dirty

Mass and radius measurements provide the constraints on which these trends are based, and the relationship between them describe the empirical, model-independent distribution of exoplanet compositions as a function of size or mass. In the era of TESS and Gaia, individual planetary masses and radii can be measured with unprecedented precision, yet selection effects and detection biases continue to confuse efforts to extract insight on a population-wide level. With updated mass constraints from transit timing variations observed by Kepler, I will present new results on the completeness-corrected mass-radius relationship of planets in tightly spaced multi-planet systems. In comparing these results to the typical densities of single-transiting planets, I will discuss which regions of parameter space would particularly benefit from both additional observations and a different approach to conducting radial velocity follow-up of transiting planets. Finally, I will discuss the implications of these results for the formation and evolution of low-mass planets., , In standard models for planet formation, solid material in protoplanetary disks coagulate and collide to form rocky bodies. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that their chemical composition will follow the abundances of refractory elements, such as Si and Fe, in the host star, which has also accreted material from the disk. Backed by planet formation simulations which validate this assumption, planetary internal structure models have begun to use stellar abundances to break degeneracies in low-mass planet compositions inferred only from mass and radius. Inconveniently, our own Solar System contradicts this approach, as its terrestrial bodies exhibit a range of rock/iron ratios and the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio is offset from the mean planetary [Si/Fe]. In this work, we explore what number and quality of observations we need to empirically measure the exoplanet-star [Si/Fe] correlation, given future transit missions, RV follow-up, and stellar characterization. Specifically, we generate synthetic datasets of terrestrial planet masses and radii and host star abundances assuming that the planets’ bulk [Si/Fe] ratio exactly tracks that of their host stars. We assign measurement uncertainties corresponding to expected precisions for TESS, PLATO, Gaia, and future RV instrumentation, and then invert the problem to infer the planet-star [Si/Fe] correlation given these observational constraints. Comparing the result to the generated truth, we find that 1% precision on the planet radii is needed to test whether [Si/Fe] ratios are correlated between exoplanet and host star. On the other hand, lower precisions can test for systematic offsets between planet and star [Si/Fe], which can constrain the importance of giant impacts for extrasolar terrestrial planet formation., The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii &lt;4 R ⊕, paving the way for the first statistical studies of super-Earth dynamics, formation, and evolution. These calculations often require planetary masses, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in a size range that lacks Solar System analogs. While previous works have derived one-to-one relationships between radius and mass, a realistic mass-radius (M-R) relation should account for the range of compositions that we expect within the population. This compositional diversity creates astrophysical scatter in the relation, which we quantify here., Table 2 shows all of the masses and radii that we consider, with our baseline data set denoted with a label of 0; the list was constructed by starting with the WM14 (Weiss &amp; Marcy, 2014ApJ...783L...6W) data set and identifying new planets and updates in the NASA Exoplanet Archive (last accessed 2015 January 30). We manually double-checked each planet to verify that the reported measurements were correct. See section 3 for further details. <P />(2 data files)., The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii &lt;4 {R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these sub-Neptunes and super-Earths. Planetary masses are an important physical property for these studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates in this Earth-to-Neptune size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. We analyze how the results depend on the radius range of the sample, and on how the masses were measured. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that M/{M}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>=2.7{(R/{R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>)}<SUP>1.3</SUP>, a scatter in mass of 1.9{M}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>, and a mass constraint to physically plausible densities, is the “best-fit” probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (R <SUB>pl</SUB> &lt; 4 {R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>). More broadly, this work provides a framework for further analyses of the M-R relation and its probable dependencies on period and stellar properties., The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii between 1 and 4 R_Earth, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of planets in a size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Masses are an important physical property for these theoretical studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. Therefore, a key practical concern is how to most accurately map a measured sub-Neptune radius to a mass estimate given the existing observations. This issue is also highly relevant to devising the most efficient follow-up programs of future transiting exoplanet detection missions such as TESS. Here we present a probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which both accounts for the anticipated intrinsic dispersion in these planets' compositions and quantifies the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that M/M_Earth = 2.7 (R/R_Earth)^1.3 and a scatter in mass of 1.9 M_Earth is the ""best-fit"" probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes (R_pl &lt; 4 R_Earth; Wolfgang, Rogers, &amp; Ford, in review). The probabilistic nature of this M-R relation has several advantages: not only does its use automatically account for a significant source of uncertainty in the comparison between planet formation theory and observation, but it can predict the yield of future transit missions' follow-up programs under the observed range of planet compositions at a given radius. We demonstrate the latter with TESS as a case study, building on Sullivan et al. 2015 to provide the RV semi-amplitude distribution predicted by this more general M-R relation and a more detailed treatment of the underlying planet population as derived from Kepler. The uncertainties in the predicted K distribution, which are driven by our derived spread of masses at a given radius, provide an additional consideration for choosing the best RV follow-up target selection strategy., The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of planets with radii between 1 and 4 R_Earth, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of planets in a size range where there are no Solar System analogs. Masses are an important physical property for these theoretical studies, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. Therefore, a key practical concern is how to most accurately map a measured sub-Neptune radius to a mass estimate given the existing observations.

The uncertainties in the predicted K distribution, which are driven by our derived spread of masses at a given radius, provide an additional consideration for choosing the best RV follow-up target selection strategy., The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of super-Earths, paving the way for the first statistical studies of the dynamics, formation, and evolution of these planets. Planetary masses are an important physical property that these studies consider, and yet the vast majority of Kepler planet candidates do not have theirs measured. A key concern for these studies is therefore how to map the measured radii to mass estimates, in this regime of planetary sizes where there are no Solar System analogs. Previous works have derived deterministic, one-to-one relationships between radius and mass. However, if these planets span a range of compositions as expected, then an intrinsic scatter about this relationship must exist in the population. Here we present the first probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters given the data. We analyze how the details depend on the radius range of the sample, and on the method used to provide the mass measurements. Assuming that the M-R relation can be described as a power law with a dispersion that is constant and normally distributed, we find that M/M_Earth = 2.7 (R/R_Earth)^1.2 and a scatter in mass of 1.7 M_Earth is the ""best-fit"" probabilistic M-R relation for the sample of RV-measured transiting sub-Neptunes., The Kepler Mission has found thousands of planetary candidates with radii between 1 and 4 {{R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>}. These planets have no analogues in our own solar system, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand the range and distribution of planetary compositions allowed by planet formation and evolution. A precise mass measurement is usually required to constrain the possible composition of an individual super-Earth-sized planet, but these measurements are difficult and expensive to make for the majority of Kepler planet candidates (PCs). Fortunately, adopting a statistical approach helps us to address this question without them. In particular, we apply hierarchical Bayesian modeling to a subsample of Kepler PCs that is complete for P\lt 25 days and {{R}<SUB>pl</SUB>}\gt 1.2 {{R}<SUB>\oplus </SUB>} and draw upon interior structure models that yield radii largely independent of mass by accounting for the thermal evolution of a gaseous envelope around a rocky core. Assuming the envelope is dominated by hydrogen and helium, we present the current-day composition distribution of the sub-Neptune-sized planet population and find that H+He envelopes are most likely to be ∼1% of these planets’ total masses with an intrinsic scatter of ±0.5 dex. We address the gaseous/rocky transition and illustrate how our results do not result in a one-to-one relationship between mass and radius for this sub-Neptune population; accordingly, dynamical studies that wish to use Kepler data must adopt a probabilistic approach to accurately represent the range of possible masses at a given radius., MRrelation calculates the posterior predictive mass distribution for an individual planet. The probabilistic mass-radius relationship (M-R relation) is evaluated within a Bayesian framework, which both quantifies this intrinsic dispersion and the uncertainties on the M-R relation parameters., The Kepler Mission has found thousands of planetary candidates with radii between 1 and 4 times that of Earth. These planets have no analogues in our Solar System, providing an unprecedented opportunity to assess planet formation and evolution processes for an entirely new planetary population. By coupling theoretical work with sophisticated statistical modeling, we place quantitative constraints on the distribution of physically relevant properties, such as planet compositions, while accurately incorporating the large uncertainties and biases in the Kepler data. We first apply this framework to the composition distribution of Kepler's sub-Neptunes: assuming an internal structure consisting of a rocky core with a hydrogen and helium envelope, we find that these envelopes are most likely to be ~ 1% of these planets' total mass with an intrinsic scatter of ± 0.5 dex. Our results do not produce a one-to-one relationship between super-Earth masses and radii. Accordingly, we derive a probability density function that incorporates the intrinsic scatter in planetary masses at a given radius, which provides dynamical studies a more appropriate means to map Kepler radii to masses. Finally, we present first results from our campaign to detect stellar companions to Kepler super-Earth host stars using the laser guide star adaptive optics systems at Lick Observatory, and discuss implications for the orbital evolution of this entirely new class of planets., With the advent of large, dedicated planet hunting surveys, the search for extrasolar planets has evolved into an effort to understand the properties and formation of a planet population whose characteristics continue to surprise the provincial perspective we've derived from our own Solar System. The Kepler Mission in particular has enabled a large number of these studies, as it was designed to stare simultaneously at thousands of stars for several years and its automated transit search pipeline enables fairly uniform detection criteria and characterizable completeness and false positive rates. With the detection of nearly 5000 planet candidates, 80% of which are smaller than 4 REarth, Kepler has especially illuminated the unexpectedly vast sub-Neptune population. Such a rich dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity for rigorous statistical study of the physics of these planets that have no analogs in our Solar System. Contributing to this endeavor, I present the statistical characterization of several aspects of this population, including the comparison between Kepler's planet candidates and low-mass occurrence rates inferred from radial velocity detections, the relationship between a sub-Neptune's mass and its radius, the frequency of Kepler planet candidate host stars which have nearby visual companions as revealed by follow-up high resolution imaging, and the distribution of gaseous mass fractions that these sub-Neptunes could possess given a rock-plus-hydrogen composition. To do so, I have used sophisticated statistical analyses such as Monte Carlo simulations and hierarchical Bayesian modeling to tie theory more closely to observations and have acquired near infrared laser guide star adaptive optics imaging of 196 Kepler Objects of Interest. I find that even within this sub-Neptune population these planets are very diverse in nature: there is intrinsic scatter in masses at a given radius, the planet host stars have visual companions at a wide range of separations, and the composition distribution spans two orders of magnitude, with a peak at 1% hydrogen and helium by mass. There is much work to be done to explain this diversity quantitatively, and especially to tie these results to various planet formation scenarios; I have no doubt that many more surprises await us., With 3500 planetary candidates discovered in its first 3 years of data, the Kepler Mission promises to answer one of the most fundamental questions posed in exoplanetary research: what kinds of planets occur most often in our Galaxy? As Kepler primarily yields planetary radii and orbital periods, it has enabled numerous studies of the occurrence rate of planets as a function of these variables. Unfortunately, the full mass distribution, and thus a direct measure of these planets' possible compositions, remains elusive due to the unsuitability of these faint targets for radial velocity follow-up and the relative rareness of transit timing variations. We show, however, that relatively straightforward models of planetary evolution in an irradiated environment can make some progress without this full mass distribution towards understanding bulk compositions of the abundant Super-Earth/Sub-Neptunes that Kepler has discovered. In particular, we constrain the distribution of envelope fractions, i.e. the fraction of a planet's mass that is in a gaseous hydrogen and helium envelope around its rocky core, for this exoplanet population that has no analogs in our Solar System. This research builds on collaborations between astronomers and statisticians forged during a three week workshop on ""Modern Statistical and Computational Methods for Analysis of Kepler Data"" at SAMSI in June 2013., With 3500 planetary candidates discovered in its first 3 years of data, the Kepler Mission promises to answer one of the most fundamental questions posed in exoplanetary research: what kinds of planets occur most often in our Galaxy?

With 1790 candidate planetary systems discovered in its first 16 months of data, Kepler promises to answer one of the most fundamental questions posed in exoplanetary research: what does the ""typical"" planetary system look like, if such a thing exists at all? The answer to this question provides insight into the relative importance of various processes at work in sculpting planetary systems and refines our understanding of our own place in the Galactic planetary census. Here I present high resolution imaging of the most recent Kepler planet candidate host stars observed with the Shane 3m laser guide star adaptive optics system at Lick Observatory, and I investigate the additional insight such information can provide for questions of planetary origin and evolution., The ongoing High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Search (HARPS) has found that 30%-50% of G and K dwarfs in the solar neighborhood host planets with M <SUB>pl</SUB> &lt;~ M <SUB>Nep</SUB> in orbits of P &lt;= 50 days. At first glance, this high overall occurrence rate seems at best to be marginally consistent with the planet frequency measured during Q0-Q2 of the Kepler mission, whose 1235 detected planetary candidates naively imply that ~15% of main-sequence dwarfs harbor a short-period planet with R <SUB>pl</SUB> &lt; 4 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>. A rigorous comparison between the two surveys is difficult, however, as they observe different stellar populations, measure different planetary physical properties, and are subject to radically different sampling plans. In this article, we report the results of a Monte Carlo study which seeks to partially overcome this apparent discrepancy by identifying plausible planetary population distributions which can jointly conform to the results of the two surveys. We find that, given the HARPS occurrence rate, either a population subject to a mass-density relationship extrapolated from our solar system or a population concurrently consisting of dense silicate-iron planets and low-density gaseous worlds can produce total numbers of planet candidates consistent with those actually detected by Kepler. However, these two mass-to-radius relationships (M-Rs) resolve the apparent occurrence rate discrepancy with different mass and period distributions, enabling future observations to rule out M-Rs that do not fully describe the observed planet population in a global sense. Extracting information of this nature from the transit-radial-velocity comparison has significant implications for the interpretation of planet occurrence rates: if a multi-valued M-R, which allows planets of similar mass to have significantly different radii, emerges from observational data, then multiple formation mechanisms are likely at work. In this event, HARPS may be detecting a large population of dense low-mass planets, while Kepler detects a large population of gaseous sub-Neptunes., The ongoing High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Search (HARPS) has found that 30-50% of FGK stars in the solar neighborhood host planets with M<SUB>pl</SUB> &lt; M<SUB>Nep</SUB> in orbits of P &lt; 50 days. At first glance, this high overall occurrence rate seems at best to be marginally consistent with the planet frequency measured during Q0-Q2 of the Kepler Mission, whose 1235 detected planetary candidates imply that ∼ 15% of main sequence dwarfs harbor a short-period planet with R<SUB>pl</SUB> &lt; 4 R<SUB>⊕ </SUB>.

In this article, we report the results of a Monte Carlo study which seeks to partially overcome this apparent discrepancy by identifying plausible planetary population distributions which can jointly conform to the results of the two surveys. We find that a population concurrently consisting of (1) dense silicate-iron planets and (2) low-density volatile and gas-dominated worlds provides a natural fit to the current data. In this scenario, the fraction of dense planets decreases with increasing mass, from f<SUB>rocky</SUB> = 90% at M = 1 M<SUB>⊕ </SUB> to f<SUB>rocky</SUB> = 10% at M = M<SUB>Nep</SUB>. Our best fit population has a total occurrence rate of 40% for 2 ≤ P ≤ 50 days and 1 ≤ M ≤ 17 M<SUB>⊕ </SUB>, and is characterized by simple power-law indices of the form N(M)dM ∝ M<SUP>α </SUP> dM and N(P)dP ∝ P<SUP>β </SUP> dP with α = -1.0 and β = 0.0. Our model population therefore contains four free parameters and is readily testable with future observations. Furthermore, our model's insistence that at least two distinct types of planets must exist in the survey data indicates that multiple formation mechanisms are at work to produce the population of planets commonly referred to as ``super-Earths""., The ongoing High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Search (HARPS) has found that 30-50% of FGK stars in the solar neighborhood host planets with M&lt;emph type=""inferior""&gt;pl&lt;/emph&gt; ≤ M&lt;emph type=""inferior""&gt;Neptune&lt;/emph&gt; in orbits of P ≤ 50 days.

At first glance, this overall occurrence rate seems inconsistent with the planet frequency measured during Q0-Q2 of the Kepler Mission, whose 1,235 detected planetary candidates imply that ~ 15% of main sequence dwarfs harbor short-period planets with R_pl &lt; 4 R_Earth. A rigorous comparison between the two surveys is difficult, however, as they observe different stellar populations and measure different planetary properties. Here we report the results of a Monte Carlo study that can account for this discrepancy via plausible distributions of planetary compositions. We find that a population concurrently consisting of (1) dense silicate-iron planets and (2) low-density gas-dominated worlds provides a natural fit to the current data. In this scenario, the fraction of dense planets decreases with increasing mass, from f_rocky = 90% at M = 1 M_Earth to f_rocky = 10% at M = 17 M_Earth. Our best fit population has a total occurrence rate of 40% for 2 &lt; P &lt; 50 days and 1 &lt; M &lt; 17 M_Earth, and is characterized by simple power-law indices of the form N(M)dM ~ M^alpha dM and N(P)dP ~ P^beta dP with alpha = -1.0 and beta = 0.0. Our model population therefore contains four free parameters and is readily testable with future observations. Furthermore, our model's insistence that at least two distinct types of planets must exist in the survey data indicates that multiple formation mechanisms are at work to produce the population of planets commonly referred to as ""super-Earths""., Based on the mass and period distributions of the super-Earths discovered by the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search, there are expected to be planets less massive than Neptune orbiting a large fraction of main sequence stars in periods of 50 days or less. Expanding on this prediction, we employ a Monte Carlo method to create populations of super-Earths with varying compositions, mass distributions, and period distributions. We then compare the results of these simulations with the planet candidates announced by Kepler on June 15, 2010, calculating a statistical best fit to identify the radial velocity super-Earth population which is most likely to reproduce Kepler's population of planet candidates., The Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP) has constructed a database of 6800 X-ray sources serendipitously detected by Chandra imaging and matched to optical counterparts with high confidence. We present new optical spectral classifications for 147 X-ray bright (f<SUB>X</SUB> 10<SUP>-14</SUP> - 10<SUP>-12</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>) ChaMP sources based primarily on observations with the FAST Spectrograph on the Tillinghast 60"" Telescope at Mt. Hopkins. 45 of these sources are identified as M stars with Hα emission and are combined with existing stellar spectra in the ChaMP database, creating a final sample size of 121 emitting M stars which we use to analyze the correlation between L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> and L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>. Analysis by Covey et al. (2008) of 40 M stars in a similar sample found evidence for a turnover in the L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> vs. L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> relationship near L<SUB>X</SUB>/ L<SUB>bol</SUB> 3 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP>. Our expanded sample nearly triples the size of the sample analyzed by Covey et al. (2008) and shows no evidence of a turnover in the L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> vs. L<SUB>X</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> relationship. However, our analysis does corroborate the existence of a plateau at L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and suggests a sample bias towards flaring stars. This work is supported in part by the NSF REU and DOD ASSURE programs under NSF grant no. 0754568 and by the Smithsonian Institution., We have confirmed membership of dozens of stars in the newly-heralded open cluster Ruprecht 147. Only recently identified as the closest (d=200 pc, m-M=6.5) old (age &gt; 1 Gyr) cluster, Ruprecht 147 provides new opportunities for the study of old K and M dwarfs with known ages.","['2019ESS.....430910W', '2019psce.confE...4W', '2018AAS...23132908W', '10.1017/S174392131600291X', '2016IAUFM..29A.223W', '2016yCat..18250019W', '10.26093/cds/vizier.18250019', 'arXiv:1504.07557', '2015arXiv150407557W', '10.3847/0004-637X/825/1/19', '2016ApJ...825...19W', '10.48550/arXiv.1504.07557', '2016AAS...22742001W', '2015ESS.....350104W', '2015IAUGA..2258521W', '10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/183', '2015ApJ...806..183W', '2014arXiv1409.2982W', 'arXiv:1409.2982', '10.48550/arXiv.1409.2982', 'ascl:1504.016', '2015ascl.soft04016W', '2015AAS...22512201W', '2015PhDT........80W', '2014AAS...22332504W', '2013DPS....4511317W', '2013AAS...22123106W', '2012ApJ...750..148W', '10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/148', '2011AGUFM.P23F..06W', '2011ESS.....2.2703W', '10.48550/arXiv.1108.5842', '2011arXiv1108.5842W', 'arXiv:1108.5842', '2011BAAS...4314019W', '2011AAS...21714019W', '2009BAAS...41..199W', '2009AAS...21340607W', '2008AAS...212.1108W', '2008BAAS...40..204W']","[('planet', 110), ('mass', 70), ('radius', 45), ('kepler', 45), ('population', 43), ('planetary', 35), ('earth', 34), ('distribution', 26), ('composition', 25), ('star', 25)]","[(('mass', 'radius'), 21), (('kepler', 'mission'), 15), (('super', 'earth'), 14), (('solar', 'system'), 13), (('planet', 'candidate'), 13), (('occurrence', 'rate'), 13), (('emph', 'type'), 12), (('radial', 'velocity'), 10), (('formation', 'evolution'), 9), (('kepler', 'planet'), 9)]","[(('emph', 'type', 'inferior'), 9), (('kepler', 'planet', 'candidates'), 7), (('mass', 'radius', 'relationship'), 6), (('majority', 'kepler', 'planet'), 6), (('kepler', 'mission', 'discovered'), 5), (('mission', 'discovered', 'thousands'), 5), (('paving', 'statistical', 'studies'), 5), (('dynamics', 'formation', 'evolution'), 5), (('vast', 'majority', 'kepler'), 5), (('planet', 'candidates', 'measured'), 5)]",Dirty

We use observations of the calibrator white dwarf WD0308-565 to validate model cross-dispersion spread functions (CDSFs). When measured as the FWHM of the CDSF, the spatial resolution ranges from 1.6"" for the central region of cenwave 1291 to 0.3"" at the red end of cenwave 1327. We found overall good agreement in the shapes of model and observed CDSFs even though the model CDSFs are approximately 0.17"" too narrow at the red half of the spectra. The model CDSFs discussed here are available for download at the COS website., We report measurements of the COS FUV spectral resolution at Lifetime Position 5 (LP5). We validated theoretical Line Spread Functions (LSFs) by convolving a high-resolution STIS spectrum of AV 75 with model LSFs and comparing narrow-line spectral features to newly observed COS spectra of the same star taken at LP5 with cenwaves G130M/1291 and G130M/1327. The resolving power at LP5 ranges from approximately 12,000 to 17,000, and is generally higher than at LP4. We found that when using the model-supplied LSFs the corresponding resolving power R was accurate to within 2,000 units, or approximately 15 percent. The model LSFs are available for download from the COS website https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos/performance/spectral-resolution., We describe the flux calibrations of COS FUV cenwaves G130M/1055 and G130M/1096, known as the blue modes. These modes are the shortest wavelength modes available with HST at medium resolutions, covering 900Å to 1,240 Å at spectral resolutions up to 13,000. A new flat field image used by both cenwaves was derived along with new sensitivity curves for each cenwave based on observations of the flux standard WD-0308-565. Comparison with the CALSPEC model spectrum of WD-0308-565 shows that the residuals of the flux calibration improved from as much as 30% to less than 1%, well within the 5% requirement. We further validate the new calibration by comparing the blue modes spectrum of WD-0308-565 to the overlapping portions of spectra taken at cenwaves G140L/800, G140L/1280, and G130M/1222. The new calibration was delivered to CRDS on 2021 February 22., We obtained spatially resolved intermediate-resolution (R~10000) red optical spectroscopy for the components of five binary systems using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through program 12938. <P />(3 data files)., We use HST/STIS optical spectroscopy of 10 M dwarfs in five closely separated binary systems to test models of M-dwarf structure and evolution. Individual dynamical masses ranging from 0.083 to 0.405 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for all stars are known from previous work. We first derive temperature, radius, luminosity, surface gravity, and metallicity by fitting the BT-Settl atmospheric models. We verify that our methodology agrees with empirical results from long-baseline optical interferometry for stars of similar spectral types. We then test whether or not evolutionary models can predict those quantities given the stars' known dynamical masses and the conditions of coevality and equal metallicity within each binary system. We apply this test to five different evolutionary model sets: the Dartmouth models, the MESA/MIST models, the models of Baraffe et al., the PARSEC models, and the YaPSI models. We find marginal agreement between evolutionary model predictions and observations, with few cases where the models respect the condition of coevality in a self-consistent manner. We discuss the pros and cons of each family of models and compare their predictive power. * Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program no. 12938., We obtained VRI photometry for all targets in our sample using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 0.9m telescope for the brighter targets and the SOuthern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Optical Imager camera on the SOAR 4.1m telescope for fainter targets. <P />SOAR observations were conducted between 2009 September and 2010 December during six observing runs comprising NOAO programs 2009B-0425, 2010A-0185, and 2010B-0176. A total of 17 nights on SOAR were used for optical photometry. <P />Table 1 shows the photometry in the photometric system used by the telescope with which the measurements were taken (Johnson-Kron-Cousins for the CTIO 0.9m telescope and Bessell for SOAR). <P />Astrometric observations are based in part on observations obtained via the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Parallax Investigation (CTIOPI), at the Cerro Tololo 0.9m telescope. CTIOPI is a large and versatile astrometric monitoring program targeting diverse types of stellar and substellar objects in the solar neighborhood. Observations are taken using the CTIO 0.9m telescope and its sole instrument, a 2048*2048 Tektronix imaging CCD detector with a plate scale of 0.401''/pixel. <P />(4 data files)., We obtained direct images of each target using NICMOS Camera 2 NIC2 through four near-infrared filters during cycles 7 (1997-1998) and 11 (2002-2003). Targets were imaged through the F110W, F180M, F207M, and F222M filters, centered at 1.10μm, 1.80μm, 2.07μm, and 2.22μm, respectively. <P />(1 data file)., The accurate determination of individual dynamical masses is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of objects at the end of the stellar main sequence. As a part of our efforts to thoroughly characterize the stellar/substellar transition region, we have recently begun an effort to obtain dynamical masses for individual components of sub-arcsecond M and L dwarf binaries. Our method combines photocentric orbits obtained as a bi-product of trigonometric parallax observations at CTIO with a single Gemini North / NIRI AO resolved image. The separation and flux ratio of the AO image is then used to scale the photocentric orbit into the barycentric orbit necessary to solve Kepler's third law. Because the photocentric orbit is measured relative to the background of ""fixed"" stars, this method also yields the mass ratio of the two components. We describe our methodology and mention the current state of the project in these proceedings.","['2023cos..rept...20D', '2023cos..rept....8D', '2022cos..rept...14D', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51610172', '2021yCat..51610172D', 'arXiv:2012.00915', '10.3847/1538-3881/abd2c2', '10.48550/arXiv.2012.00915', '2020arXiv201200915D', '2021AJ....161..172D', '2015yCat..51470094D', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51470094', '2013yCat..51440064D', '10.26093/cds/vizier.51440064', '2011ASPC..448..849D', '2011csss...16..849D']","[('model', 20), ('observation', 10), ('telescope', 10), ('resolution', 8), ('co', 7), ('spectrum', 6), ('obtained', 6), ('cenwaves', 5), ('spectral', 5), ('star', 5)]","[(('space', 'telescope'), 4), (('dynamical', 'mass'), 4), (('co', 'fuv'), 3), (('spectral', 'resolution'), 3), (('binary', 'system'), 3), (('data', 'file'), 3), (('evolutionary', 'model'), 3), (('cerro', 'tololo'), 3), (('ctio', 'telescope'), 3), (('photocentric', 'orbit'), 3)]","[(('cos', 'fuv', 'cenwaves'), 2), (('download', 'cos', 'website'), 2), (('hubble', 'space', 'telescope'), 2), (('individual', 'dynamical', 'masses'), 2), (('cerro', 'tololo', 'inter'), 2), (('tololo', 'inter', 'american'), 2), (('inter', 'american', 'observatory'), 2), (('report', 'spatial', 'resolution'), 1), (('spatial', 'resolution', 'cos'), 1), (('resolution', 'cos', 'fuv'), 1)]",Dirty

Eos observes molecular clouds in our galaxy and nearby planet forming disks to understand the link between star and planet formation and molecular hydrogen in galactic star forming regions. Eos does this using very long-slit, high resolution spectroscopy of far ultraviolet (FUV) emission from fluorescent molecular hydrogen (H<SUB>2</SUB>), a powerful and underutilized FUV diagnostic. H<SUB>2</SUB> is the most abundant molecule in the universe, but is typically observed in the infrared (IR) or inferred via proxies such as CO. Eos will directly observe H<SUB>2</SUB> via fluorescence, which can be stimulated from a range of sources (shocks, interstellar UV radiation, bright stars, etc). Here we briefly describe the science objectives of Eos, as well as the instrument implementation., The process of developing space mission concepts for submission to a NASA announcement of opportunity (AO) is incredibly complex. A potential principal investigator (PI) needs to be able to develop a strong, well-motivated, internally coherent science case, while also coordinating a large team of people. This coordination involves networking and partnering with aerospace companies and NASA centers, building a science team, and receiving support from the home institution, among many other tasks. The process of building the team needs to be started well in advance of the release of the final AO (typically only three months before the submission date) and the best ways to do this are only obvious after one has been through the process. This lack of good information on the process provides a huge barrier to entry for early career researchers or new PIs who have a good science idea but limited mission development experience. This barrier is obvious in the demographics of PIs (See Centrella, 2019 for astrophysics Explorer PI demographics) and was recently reported on extensively by the National Academies in the Bagenal-Ward report on competed space mission leadership: ""Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Leadership of Competed Space Missions"" (NASEM, 2022). <P />The PI Launchpad workshop (jointly funded by NASA and the Heising-Simons Foundation) addresses these challenges by focusing on providing information at a high level about the typical mission development process and conveying to interested scientists the recommended timelines and steps for proposing a mission. In this presentation, we report on the plans for the third PI Launchpad workshop, which will be held in-person in Ann Arbor, Michigan in late July 2023. As in previous versions (find more info here: https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/pi-launchpad), the workshop will have an application available on NSPIRES in early 2023, with an expectation of selecting up to 40 participants. All travel, lodging, meals, and transportation costs will be covered for the selected participants. The workshop agenda will include science storytelling, developing science objectives, components of the proposal, strategies for building support, and networking opportunities., We present Hyperion, a mission concept recently proposed to the December 2021 NASA Medium Explorer announcement of opportunity. Hyperion explores the formation and destruction of molecular clouds and planet-forming disks in nearby star-forming regions of the Milky Way. It does this using long-slit high-resolution spectroscopy of emission from fluorescing molecular hydrogen, which is a powerful far-ultraviolet (FUV) diagnostic. Molecular hydrogen (H<SUB>2</SUB>) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and a key ingredient for star and planet formation but is typically not observed directly because its symmetric atomic structure and lack of a dipole moment mean there are no spectral lines at visible wavelengths and few in the infrared. Hyperion uses molecular hydrogen's wealth of FUV emission lines to achieve three science objectives: (1) determining how star formation is related to molecular hydrogen formation and destruction at the boundaries of molecular clouds, (2) determining how quickly and by what process massive star feedback disperses molecular clouds, and (3) determining the mechanism driving the evolution of planet-forming disks around young solar-analog stars. Hyperion conducts this science using a straightforward, highly efficient, single-channel instrument design. Hyperion's instrument consists of a 48-cm primary mirror with an f/5 focal ratio. The spectrometer has two modes, both covering 138.5- to 161.5-nm bandpasses. A low resolution mode has a spectral resolution of R ≥ 10,000 with a slit length of 65 arcmin, whereas the high-resolution mode has a spectral resolution of R ≥ 50,000 over a slit length of 5 armin. Hyperion occupies a 2-week-long high-earth lunar resonance TESS-like orbit and conducts 2 weeks of planned observations per orbit, with time for downlinks and calibrations. Hyperion was reviewed as category I, which is the highest rating possible but was not selected., The PI Launchpad attempts to provide an entry level explanation of the process of space mission development for new Principal Investigators (PIs). In particular, PI launchpad has a focus on building teams, making partnerships, and science concept maturity for a space mission concept, not necessarily technical or engineering practices. Here we briefly summarize the goals of the PI Launchpad workshops and present some results from the workshops held in 2019 and 2021. The workshop attempts to describe the current process of space mission development (i.e. space-based telescopes and instrument platforms, planetary missions of all types, etc.), covering a wide range of topics that a new PI may need to successfully develop a team and write a proposal. It is not designed to replace real experience but to provide an easily accessible resource for potential PIs who seek to learn more about what it takes to submit a space mission proposal, and what the first steps to take can be. The PI Launchpad was created in response to the high barrier to entry for early career or any scientist who is unfamiliar with mission design. These barriers have been outlined in several recent papers and reports, and are called out in recent space science Decadal reports., The Faint Intergalactic Medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall) is a mission designed to observe faint emission from the circumgalactic medium of moderate-redshift (z ∼ 0.7) galaxies for the first time. FIREBall observes a component of galaxies that plays a key role in how galaxies form and evolve, likely contains a significant amount of baryons, and has only recently been observed at higher redshifts in the visible. Here we report on the 2018 flight of the FIREBall-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on 2018 September 22 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete redesign of the spectrograph from the original FIREBall fiber-fed integral field unit to a wide-field multiobject spectrograph. The flight was terminated early owing to a hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the FIREBall-2 spectrograph, including modifications from the original FIREBall payload, and provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to successfully flight-test a new pointing control system, a UV-optimized, delta-doped, and coated electron multiplying CCD, and an aspheric grating. The FIREBall-2 team is rebuilding the payload for another flight attempt in the fall of 2021, delayed from 2020 as a result of COVID-19., In this talk, I will briefly examine the landscape for low-noise (&lt;1 e) detectors in the ultraviolet. UV observations typically have very low noise backgrounds (for example, in astrophysical observations, the sky background orders of magnitude lower in the UV than in the visible), leaving detector noise as the dominant noise source, especially in spectroscopy. A number of different UV detector technologies are now available, each with very low noise. These include the standard MicroChannel Plate, as well as EMCCDs, MKIDs, and Skipper CCDs. I will describe the drawbacks and benefits of each of these ultra-low noise detectors within the context of UV and solar system observations, as well as the timeline for their eventual use., The Faint Intergalactic medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2) is an ultraviolet multi-object spectrograph mission designed to observe the faint gas surrounding z ≈ 0.7 galaxies from the very top of the Earth's stratosphere, explains Project Scientist Erika Hamden., Here we discuss advances in UV technology over the last decade, with an emphasis on photon counting, low noise, high efficiency detectors in sub-orbital programs. We focus on the use of innovative UV detectors in a NASA astrophysics balloon telescope, FIREBall-2, which successfully flew in the Fall of 2018. The FIREBall-2 telescope is designed to make observations of distant galaxies to understand more about how they evolve by looking for diffuse hydrogen in the galactic halo. The payload utilizes a 1.0-meter class telescope with an ultraviolet multi-object spectrograph and is a joint collaboration between Caltech, JPL, LAM, CNES, Columbia, the University of Arizona, and NASA. The improved detector technology that was tested on FIREBall-2 can be applied to any UV mission. We discuss the results of the flight and detector performance. We will also discuss the utility of sub-orbital platforms (both balloon payloads and rockets) for testing new technologies and proof-of-concept scientific ideas., In this talk, I will describe briefly the telescope, instrument, and flight of the Faint Intergalactic medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2). FIREBall-2 is a UV multi-object spectrograph fed by a 1 meter parabola mirror. The instrument was designed to observe 4 pre-selected fields and uses a UV optimized delta-doped EMCCD. The telescope flew on September 22, 2018 from Fort Sumner, NM, as part of the fall CSBF balloon campaign. The telescope collected data for several night hours before being cut down. I will describe the testing, flight, and hardware preformance. Additional talks will be presented on the calibrations and data results., In this talk, I will discuss advances in UV technology over the last decade, with an emphasis on photon counting, low noise, high efficiency detectors. I will focus on the use of innovative UV detectors in a NASA astrophysics balloon telescope, FIREBall-2, which is expected to fly in the fall of 2018. The FIREBall-2 telescope focuses on observations of distant galaxies to understand more about how they evolve by looking for diffuse hydrogen in the galactic halo. The telescope is a 1.0 meter ultraviolet multi-object spectrograph that is a joint collaboration between Caltech, JPL, LAM, CNES, Columbia, and NASA. The improved detector technology that will be tested on FIREBall-2 can be applied to any UV mission. The FIREBall-2 flight test, and associated laboratory and environmental testing will make these detectors a robust option for any future UV mission which needs low noise and high efficiency. I will discuss the scientific results of the flight and detector performance., I will discuss the latest results from the Hamden UV/Vis Detector Lab and our ongoing work using a UV optimized EMCCD in flight. Our lab is currently testing efficiency and performance of delta-doped, anti-reflection coated EMCCDs, in collaboration with JPL. The lab has been set-up to test quantum efficiency, dark current, clock-induced-charge, and read noise. I will describe our improvements to our circuit boards for lower noise, updates from a new, more flexible NUVU controller, and the integration of an EMCCD in the FIREBall-2 UV spectrograph. I will also briefly describe future plans to conduct radiation testing on delta-doped EMCCDs (both warm, unbiased and cold, biased configurations) thus summer and longer term plans for testing newer photon counting CCDs as I move the HUVD Lab to the University of Arizona in the Fall of 2018., Co-I Proposal: The Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2) is de- signed to discover and map faint emission from the circumgalactic medium of low redshift galaxies (0.3&lt;z2) redshifts. FIREBall-2 is the only UV instrument currently proven and able to make these necessary discoveries in the lowredshift universe. Multiple flights of this very valuable facility will pave the way for lowredshift CGM physics alongside high-redshift CGM detections with ground-based surveys! FIREBall-2 will continue to serve as a platform to test cutting-edge technologies and science strategies for future space missions. The 2018 flight of FIREBall-2 demonstrated the successful performance of all subsystems and provided a test flight for several key technology innovations: the UV-optimized EMCCD, the anamorphic UV grating, a widefield UV multi-object spectrograph, and a gondola with sub-arcsecond pointing stability. Between this program's two proposed flights, we will fabricate, characterize, and demonstrate a new, visible light-blocking filter on our UV- optimized EMCCD, a critical technology development for future UV missions seeking to use a CCD at UV wavelength. UV CCDs are notoriously prone to ""red light leak,"" and this new filter will cut visible light sensitivity of these detectors to virtually 0%! The FIREBall-2 team is comprised of an international consortium of experts in suborbital scientific ballooning and IGM/CGM physics. The team includes several female graduate students and postdocs in key roles and is managed by a female postdoctoral scholar (supported by a Caltech Experimental Prize Fellowship). FIREBall-2's flights will continue to provide vital training for the next generation of astrophysicists working on UV and space instrumentation. FIREBall-2 combines several innovations and noteworthy goals: • Simultaneously addresses high-priority science questions stated in NASA's 2014 Strategic Plan and UV technology development emphasized by New Worlds New Horizons (NWNH) and AURA; • Demonstrates the first ever multi-object UV spectrograph suitable for future UV missions; • Demonstrates a high-QE, low-noise, photon-counting, UV-optimized CCD for space missions; • Flies a 1-m class UV telescope, enabled by low cost optics and innovative mounts; • Demonstrates a state-of-the-art, arcsecond-precision balloon pointing system; • Builds on an international space agency partnership between NASA &amp; CNES; • Benefits from the expertise found in a long-running institutional collaboration between Caltech/JPL, Columbia University, LAM (France), CNES (France), and University of Arizona; • Utilizes innovative optical solutions, such as a Schmidt corrector built into UV grating, which provides superior optical performance and throughput; • Trains the next-generation of instrumentation PIs, with a total of 11 Ph.D. students graduated or currently supported between FB-1 (3) and FIREBall-2 (8)., , We report on multilayer high efficiency antireflection coating (ARC) design and development for use at UV wavelengths on CCDs and other Si-based detectors. We have previously demonstrated a set of single-layer coatings, which achieve &gt;50% quantum efficiency (QE) in four bands from 130 to 300 nm. We now present multilayer coating designs that significantly outperform our previous work between 195 and 215 nm. Using up to 11 layers, we present several model designs to reach QE above 80%. We also demonstrate the successful performance of 5 and 11 layer ARCs on silicon and fused silica substrates. Finally, we present a five-layer coating deposited onto a thinned, delta-doped CCD and demonstrate external QE greater than 60% between 202 and 208 nm, with a peak of 67.6% at 206 nm., The Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2) is a UV multi-object spectrograph experiment designed to observe low-density emission from HI, CIV, and OVI in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around low-redshift galaxies (z=0.3-1.0) from a high altitude balloon. To detect this diffuse emission, we have chosen to use a high-efficiency photon-counting EMCCD as part of FIREBall-2's detector system. The flight camera system includes a custom printed circuit board, a mechanical cryo-cooler, zeolite and charcoal getters, and a NUVU controller, for fast read-out speeds and waveform shaping. Here we report on overall detector system performance. We describe our characterization of detector noise from a delta-doped, anti-reflection-coated, electron-multiplying e2v CCD201-20. We describe our use of a NUVU controller to create custom waveforms that reduce clock-induced charge (CIC). We detail the clock frequencies, waveform shapes, and well depths required to reduce parallel and serial CIC to acceptable levels for our application (~10<SUP>-3</SUP> events/pix/frame), at a range of substrate voltages. We also describe dark current measurements at several temperatures, including at our operating temperature of -115°C, with the flight set-up., The Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2) is an experiment designed to observe low density emission from HI, CIV, and OVI in the circum-galactic medium around low-redshift galaxies. To detect this diffuse emission, we use a high-efficiency photon-counting EMCCD as part of FIREBall-2's detector. The flight camera system includes a custom printed circuit board, a mechanical cryo-cooler, zeolite and charcoal getters, and a Nüvü controller, for fast read-out speeds and waveform shaping. Here we report on overall detector system performance, including pressure and temperature stability. We describe dark current and CIC measurements at several temperatures and substrate voltages, with the flight set-up., The Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall) is a NASA/CNES balloon-borne ultraviolet multi-object spectrograph designed to observe the diffuse gas around galaxies (the circumgalactic medium) via line emission redshifted to ~205 nm. FIREBall uses a ultraviolet-optimized delta doped e2v CCD201 with a custom designed high efficiency five layer anti-reflection coating. This combination achieves very high quantum efficiency (QE) and photon-counting capability, a first for a CCD detector in this wavelength range. We also present new work on red blocking mirror coatings to reduce red leak., This work integrates observing and instrumentation projects to explore diffuse gas and dust in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM, CGM). We first present an all sky map of the diffuse Galactic FUV background using all sky survey data from GALEX. We focus in detail on the FUV behavior of selected dusty Galactic clouds and their relationship to 100 micron emission. We also describe ongoing instrumentation projects aimed at observing the CGM around galaxies at a range of redshifts. The Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall), is a balloon borne multi-object spectrograph designed to observe the CGM using ultraviolet emission lines (Lyman alpha, CIV, OVI) redshifted into an atmospheric window at 205nm. FIREBall will also serve as a test-bed for a high efficiency CCD UV detector, which has achieved world record quantum efficiency at these wavelengths. We present both the detector technology and predicted detection limits in anticipation of a launch in 2015. The Circumgalactic H-alpha Spectrograph (CHAS), is a narrowband H alpha IFU designed to detect the CGM in nearby galaxies. We present recent data from a successful prototype built entirely at Columbia (proto-CHAS), along with anticipated detection limits for long duration observations., The diffuse universe, consisting of baryons that have not yet collapsed into structures such as stars, galaxies, etc., has not been well studied. While the intergalactic and circumgalactic mediums (IGM &amp; CGM) may contain 30-40% of the baryons in the universe, this low density gas is difficult to observe. Yet it is likely a key driver of the evolution of galaxies and star formation through cosmic time. The IGM provides a reservoir of gas that can be used for star formation, if it is able to accrete onto a galaxy. The CGM bridges the IGM and the galaxy itself, as a region of both inflows from the IGM and outflows from galactic star formation and feedback. The diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) gas and dust in the galaxy itself may also be affected by the CGM of the galaxy. Careful observations of the ISM of our own Galaxy may provide evidence of interaction with the CGM. These three regions of low density, the IGM, CGM, and ISM, are arbitrary divisions of a continuous flow of low density material into and out of galaxies. My thesis focuses on observations of this low density material using existing telescopes as well as on the development of technology and instruments that will increase the sensitivity of future missions. I used data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to create an all sky map of the diffuse Galactic far ultraviolet (FUV) background, probing the ISM of our own galaxy and comparing to other Galactic all sky maps. The FUV background is primarily due to dust scattered starlight from bright stars in the Galactic plane, and the changing intensity across the sky can be used to characterize dust scattering asymmetry and albedo. We measure a consistent low level non-scattered isotropic component to the diffuse FUV, which may be due in small part to an extragalactic component. There are also several regions of unusually high FUV intensity given other Galactic quantities. Such regions may be the location of interactions between Galactic super-bubbles and the CGM. Other ways of probing the CGM including direct detection via emission lines. I built a proto-type of the Circumgalactic Halpha Spectrograph (CHalphaS), a wide-field, low-cost, narrow-band integral field unit (IFU) that is designed to observe Halpha emission from the CGM of nearby, low-z galaxies. This proto-type has had two recent science runs, with preliminary data on several nearby galaxies. Additional probes of the CGM are emission lines in the rest ultra-violet. These include OVI, Lyalpha, CIV, SiIII, CIII, CII, FeII, and MgII. Such lines are accessible for low redshift galaxies in the space UV, historically a difficult wavelength range in which to work due in part to low efficiency of the available detectors. I have worked with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop advanced anti-reflection (AR) coatings for use on thinned, delta-doped charge coupled device (CCD) detectors. These detectors have achieved world record quantum efficiency (QE) at UV wavelengths (&gt;50% between 130 nm and 300nm), with the potential for even greater QE with a more complex coating. One of these AR coated detectors will be used on the Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2), a balloon-born UV spectrograph designed to observe the CGM at 205 nm via redshifted Lyalpha (at z=0.7), CIV (at z=0.3), and OVI (at z=1.0). FIREBall-2 will launch in the fall of 2015., We present an all-sky map of the diffuse Galactic far ultraviolet (1344-1786 Å) background using Galaxy Evolution Explorer data, covering 65% of the sky with 11.79 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> pixels. We investigate the dependence of the background on Galactic coordinates, finding that a standard cosecant model of intensity is not a valid fit. Furthermore, we compare our map to Galactic all-sky maps of 100 μm emission, N <SUB>H I </SUB> column, and Hα intensity. We measure a consistent low level far-UV (FUV) intensity at zero points for other Galactic quantities, indicating a 300 photons cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> Å<SUP>-1</SUP> non-scattered isotropic component to the diffuse FUV. There is also a linear relationship between FUV and 100 μm emission below 100 μm values of 8 MJy sr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We find a similar linear relationship between FUV and N <SUB>H I </SUB> below 10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. The relationship between FUV and Hα intensity has no such constant cutoff. For all Galactic quantities, the slope of the linear portion of the relationship decreases with Galactic latitude. A modified cosecant model, taking into account dust scattering asymmetry and albedo, is able to accurately fit the diffuse FUV at latitudes above 20°. The best fit model indicates an albedo, a, of 0.62 ± 0.04 and a scattering asymmetry function, g, of 0.78 ± 0.05. Deviations from the model fit may indicate regions of excess FUV emission from fluorescence or shock fronts, while low latitude regions with depressed FUV emission are likely the result of self-shielding dusty clouds., We describe recent progress in the development of anti-reflection coatings for use at UV wavelengths on CCDs and other Si-based detectors. We have previously demonstrated a set of coatings which are able to achieve greater than 50% QE in 4 bands from 130nm to greater than 300nm. We now present new refinements of these AR-coatings which will improve performance in a narrower bandpass by 50% over previous work. Successful test films have been made to optimize transmission at 190nm, reaching 80% potential transmission., We describe a project to observe and model the FUV signatures of diffuse galactic clouds. IR-excess clouds identified by Desert et al. (1988) and cold cores identified by the early cold core catalogue (ECC) from the Planck collaboration (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011) are used to identify potential dusty clouds. The GALEX AIS survey data of these dusty clouds are compared to the 100 micron dust maps from Schlegel, Finkbeiner, Davis (1998). We are developing a cloud model to predict and characterize the FUV behavior of these clouds given their positions in the galaxy, dust composition, and other properties. This model uses galactic dust information derived from realistic Galactic models (3D), combined with Hipparcos stars to create a reasonably good simulation of the galaxy in dust and illumination. Small dusty clouds are placed throughout the model and the predicted reflected FUV light is measured using ray-tracing. We present the results of this model as they compare to existing FUV and dust emission., We report on the development of coatings for a charged-coupled device (CCD) detector optimized for use in a fixed dispersion UV spectrograph. Because of the rapidly changing index of refraction of Si, single layer broadband antireflection (AR) coatings are not suitable to increase quantum efficiency at all wavelengths of interest. Instead, we describe a creative solution that provides excellent performance over UV wavelengths. We describe progress in the development of a coated CCD detector with theoretical quantum efficiencies (QEs) of greater than 60% at wavelengths from 120 to 300nm. This high efficiency may be reached by coating a backside-illuminated, thinned, delta-doped CCD with a series of thin film AR coatings. The materials tested include MgF2 (optimized for highest performance from 120--150nm), SiO2 (150--180nm), Al2O3 (180--240nm), MgO (200--250nm), and HfO2 (240--300nm). A variety of deposition techniques were tested and a selection of coatings that minimized reflectance on a Si test wafer were applied to functional devices. We also discuss future uses and improvements, including graded and multilayer coatings., Measuring the full three-dimensional motions of extragalactic objects in the universe presents a seemingly insurmountable challenge. In this Letter, we investigate the application of a technique to measure tangential motion that has previously only been applied nearby within the Local Group of galaxies, to clusters of galaxies far beyond its borders. We show that mapping the mean line-of-sight motion throughout a galaxy cluster could in principle be used to detect the perspective rotation induced by the projection of the cluster's tangential motion into the line of sight. The signal will be most prominent for clusters of the largest angular extent, most symmetric intrinsic velocity distribution and surveyed with the largest number of pointings possible. We investigate the feasibility of detecting this signal using three different approaches: measuring line-of-sight motions of individual cluster members, taking spectra of intracluster gas, and mapping distortions of the cosmic microwave background radiation. We conclude that future spectroscopic surveys of thousands of members of nearby galaxy clusters hold the most promise of measuring cluster tangential motions using this technique., Since their development in the late 1960s, CCDs have revolutionized observational astronomy. But poor performance at UV wavelengths, coupled with historically high noise, have required the development of alternative detectors for UV telescopes and instruments. These alternatives, including micro-channel plate detectors of the type used on GALEX, still achieve low quantum (&lt;10-20%) efficiency, and pose their own set of unique hardware challenges in flight. Here we report on the development of a second generation UV detector which is predicted to achieve QEs of over 60% in the space ultraviolet. This high efficiency may be reached by modifying a backside illuminated delta-doped Low Light Level (L3) CCD with a thin film, in the manner of an anti-reflection coating. Increased transmission into the Si subsrate from the coating and the extremely low read-noise of L3 CCDs help to boost efficiency. Preliminary testing has shown great promise for this method. Furthermore, we detail the specific use of this detector in a spectrograph optimized for UV wavelengths from 100nm to 300nm, with particular emphasis on the next generation spectrograph to be flown as part of the FIREBall balloon payload., Rooftop Variables (RV) is a NASA-supported outreach program that teams Columbia University (CU) graduate students with New York City public school teachers. RV aims to increase student exposure to astronomy by using participation in research programs as a motivator for both teachers and students. During their first year in RV, teachers are trained to use a 6'' telescope equipped with a 1.4 megapixel CCD camera to take and reduce photometric data. In their second year, the teachers are loaned the same equipment and start astronomy clubs at their schools with the assistance of the CU graduate students; these clubs are intended to involve students in observational programs. RV data have already contributed to campaigns to determine the flare frequency distribution on inactive early M-dwarfs, which requires dozens of hours of monitoring in short intervals. The RV data will be combined with data from several other telescopes measuring active and later-type stars. Here we discuss our teacher recruitment and training and provide some sample data obtained from the West Harlem Observatory (WHO), one of the most light-polluted locations in the world. <P />Support for this work was provided by NASA through Chandra Award Number GO8-9012X issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center.","['2024SPIE13093E..0CH', '10.1117/12.3017644', '2022AGUFMSA25A..05H', '10.48550/arXiv.2212.06869', 'arXiv:2212.06869', '10.1117/1.JATIS.8.4.044008', '2022JATIS...8d4008H', '2022arXiv221206869H', 'arXiv:2210.03769', '10.3389/fspas.2022.1048644', '2022FrASS...948644H', '2022arXiv221003769H', '10.48550/arXiv.2210.03769', '2020arXiv200708528H', '10.48550/arXiv.2007.08528', 'arXiv:2007.08528', '2020ApJ...898..170H', '10.3847/1538-4357/aba1e0', '2019AGUFM.P43G3525H', '10.1038/s41550-019-0866-0', '2019NatAs...3..783H', '10.1117/12.2518711', '2019SPIE10982E..20H', '2019arXiv190500433H', '10.48550/arXiv.1905.00433', 'arXiv:1905.00433', '2019AAS...23313601H', '2018AGUFM.P24C..06H', '2018AAS...23231003H', '2018apra.prop..150H', '2017koa..prop..368H', 'arXiv:1701.02733', '2017arXiv170102733H', '10.48550/arXiv.1701.02733', '2016JATIS...2c6003H', '10.1117/1.JATIS.2.3.036003', '2016AAS...22711306H', '2015SPIE.9601E..0OH', '10.1117/12.2190679', '2014SPIE.9144E..2XH', '10.1117/12.2056204', '2014AAS...22313604H', '2014PhDT.......152H', '10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/180', '2013arXiv1311.0875H', '2013ApJ...779..180H', '10.48550/arXiv.1311.0875', 'arXiv:1311.0875', '2012SPIE.8453E..09H', '10.1117/12.927208', '2012AAS...21932002H', 'arXiv:1102.2241', '10.48550/arXiv.1102.2241', '2011arXiv1102.2241H', '10.1364/AO.50.004180', '2011ApOpt..50.4180H', '2010ApJ...716L.205H', 'arXiv:1005.4430', '2010arXiv1005.4430H', '10.1088/2041-8205/716/2/L205', '10.48550/arXiv.1005.4430', '2010BAAS...42..591H', '2010AAS...21538008H', '2010AAS...21544605H', '2010BAAS...42Q.413H']","[('uv', 47), ('fireball', 37), ('detector', 35), ('galaxy', 33), ('emission', 29), ('low', 29), ('mission', 24), ('high', 23), ('galactic', 22), ('fuv', 22)]","[(('delta', 'doped'), 10), (('high', 'efficiency'), 10), (('space', 'mission'), 9), (('faint', 'intergalactic'), 9), (('redshifted', 'emission'), 9), (('emission', 'balloon'), 9), (('balloon', 'fireball'), 9), (('designed', 'observe'), 9), (('multi', 'object'), 9), (('low', 'noise'), 8)]","[(('redshifted', 'emission', 'balloon'), 9), (('emission', 'balloon', 'fireball'), 9), (('multi', 'object', 'spectrograph'), 8), (('faint', 'intergalactic', 'medium'), 5), (('intergalactic', 'medium', 'redshifted'), 5), (('medium', 'redshifted', 'emission'), 5), (('ultraviolet', 'multi', 'object'), 4), (('low', 'redshift', 'galaxies'), 4), (('faint', 'intergalactic', 'redshifted'), 4), (('intergalactic', 'redshifted', 'emission'), 4)]",Dirty

We report the power spectra over the spherical harmonic multipole range 50&lt; {\ell }≤slant 8000 and detect nine acoustic peaks in the EE spectrum with high signal-to-noise ratio. These measurements are the most sensitive to date of the EE and TE power spectra at {\ell }&gt; 1050 and {\ell }&gt; 1475, respectively. The observations cover 500 {\deg }<SUP>2</SUP>, a fivefold increase in area compared to previous SPTpol analyses, which increases our sensitivity to the photon diffusion damping tail of the CMB power spectra enabling tighter constraints on ΛCDM model extensions. After masking all sources with unpolarized flux &gt; 50 mJy, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on residual polarized point-source power of {D}<SUB>{\ell </SUB>}={\ell }({\ell }+1){C}<SUB>{\ell </SUB>}/2π &lt; 0.107 μ {{{K}}}<SUP>2</SUP> at {\ell }=3000, suggesting that the EE damping tail dominates foregrounds to at least {\ell }=4050 with modest source masking. We find that the SPTpol data set is in mild tension with the ΛCDM model (2.1σ ), and different data splits prefer parameter values that differ at the ∼ 1 σ level. When fitting SPTpol data at {\ell }&lt; 1000, we find cosmological parameter constraints consistent with those for Planck temperature. Including SPTpol data at {\ell }&gt; 1000 results in a preference for a higher value of the expansion rate ({H}<SUB>0</SUB>=71.3+/- 2.1 {km} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>{{Mpc}}<SUP>-1</SUP> ) and a lower value for present-day density fluctuations ({σ }<SUB>8</SUB>=0.77+/- 0.02)., All-sky surveys of the primary temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are now cosmic variance limited on large to intermediate scales. To place tighter constraints on cosmology from CMB primary anisotropies we turn to measurements of CMB polarization. Not only is polarization another probe of ΛCDM cosmology, but secondary anisotropies are expected to have low polarized emission, which opens more of the so-called CMB damping tail to cosmological study. In this talk, we present new 150 GHz measurements of the CMB E-mode polarization auto-power and temperature-E-mode cross-power spectra from a 500 deg<SUP>2</SUP> patch of sky observed with the SPTpol instrument, the second-generation receiver installed on the South Pole Telescope. Over a range of spherical harmonic multipoles 50 ≤ l &lt; 10000 we detect 9 acoustic peaks in the E-mode spectrum. With these spectra we constrain ΛCDM cosmology independently from temperature-only measurements, and present new joint constraints with the Planck temperature auto-power spectrum. The CMB is also gravitationally lensed by large-scale structure. We use our high-fidelity map of E-mode polarization, in conjunction with SPTpol maps of B-mode polarization and temperature, to map the lensing potential of the CMB and measure its corresponding power spectrum. Finally, the CMB lensing potential can be combined with our E-mode map to estimate lensing B modes present in our field, which can be delensed to improve constraints on primordial B modes and the energy scale of inflation through the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r., We discuss the design and status of the third generation camera, SPT-3G, for the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the scientific goals of the resultant SPT-3G survey. The SPT is a 10-m telescope located at the NSF Amundsen-Scott South Pole station optimized for low-noise and high-resolution imaging of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The camera will consist of 16,200 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensors (TES), contained within 2,700 multichroic pixels with observing bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. The SPT-3G survey will observe for four years starting in 2016. It will map 2500 square degrees to a depth of approximately 2 μK·arcmin in temperature: an order of magnitude lower noise than current state-of-the-art arcminute-scale surveys over comparable areas. This unprecedented map depth will enable high signal-to-noise imaging of B-modes due to gravitational lensing of the CMB. These measurements will place constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses and the shape and amplitude of an inflationary B-mode signal at larger angular scales. The SPT-3G survey will also detect several thousand clusters, in particular significantly expanding the number of known high-redshift massive clusters, enabling new constraints on gravity and cosmology., SPTpol is a millimeter-wavelength polarization-sensitive receiver installed on the South Pole Telescope, and it completed its second season of observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies in the fall of 2013. The receiver contains 588 dual polarization pixels at 150 GHz and 180 at 90 GHz, comprising a total of 1536 transition edge sensor bolometers. In its first year, SPTpol mapped 100 deg<SUB>2</SUB> to a depth of ~ 7 and 10 μK-arcmin at 150 GHz in temperature and polarization, respectively. With this “deep-field” map, the SPTpol collaboration produced the first statistically significant detection (7.7 σ) of lensing B modes, which are produced by gravitational lensing of the E-mode CMB polarization generated at the surface of last scattering. Additionally, the full SPTpol survey just completed the first of three years mapping 500 deg<SUB>2</SUB> of the southern sky. Data from the full survey will constrain the sum of the masses of neutrino species through their effect on gravitational lensing B modes. High signal-to-noise measurements of the E-mode damping tail from the full-field survey will also further constrain cosmological parameters and extensions to the concordance ΛCDM cosmological model. In this presentation, I will discuss preliminary results and forecasts on cosmological constraints from the full SPTpol data set., SPTpol is a polarization-sensitive receiver installed on the South Pole Telescope in its third season of mapping Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. The receiver contains 588 (180) dual polarization pixels at 150 (95) GHz comprising a total of 1536 transition edge sensor bolometers. In its first year, SPTpol mapped 100 deg2 to a depth of ∼ 8 and 10 muK-arcmin at 150 GHz in temperature and polarization, respectively. With this deep field map, the SPTpol collaboration produced the first statistically significant detection (7.7 sigma) of gravitational lensing B-mode polarization. Additionally, the SPTpol experiment just completed its first of three years mapping 500 deg2 to a depth of ∼ 12 and 15 muK-arcmin in temperature and polarization at 150 GHz. High signal-to-noise measurements of the polarization power spectra from the survey will further constrain cosmological parameters and extensions to the LambdaCDM cosmological model. Measurements of large-scale polarization anisotropies will also place tighter constraints on the existence of primordial B-mode polarization generated by gravitational waves from the epoch of inflation. In this work we discuss the development of the SPTpol receiver and, in particular, the seven 150 GHz detector modules at the heart of the focal plane. We describe the observational strategies used during the first two seasons of SPTpol measurements as well as the reduction of detector timestreams into maps and CMB polarization power spectra. To extract constraints on cosmological parameters from the SPTpol power spectra we have written a new Bayesian likelihood module for the CosmoMC Markov Chain Monte Carlo package, which we also describe. Finally, we present cosmological constraints from the first year of SPTpol observations. Pre-existing constraints on LambdaCDM parameters improve by a few percent with the inclusion of these data. While this is a modest step forward in our understanding of the early universe, the completed SPTpol dataset will have the power to tightly constrain the sum of neutrino masses and help determine the source of recently detected large-scale B-mode polarization., The SPTpol camera is a dichroic polarimetric receiver at 90 and 150 GHz. Deployed in January 2012 on the South Pole Telescope (SPT), SPTpol is looking for faint polarization signals in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The camera consists of 180 individual Transition Edge Sensor (TES) polarimeters at 90 GHz and seven 84-polarimeter camera modules (a total of 588 polarimeters) at 150 GHz. We present the design, dark characterization, and in-lab optical properties of the 150 GHz camera modules. The modules consist of photolithographed arrays of TES polarimeters coupled to silicon platelet arrays of corrugated feedhorns, both of which are fabricated at NIST-Boulder. In addition to mounting hardware and RF shielding, each module also contains a set of passive readout electronics for digital frequency-domain multiplexing. A single module, therefore, is fully functional as a miniature focal plane and can be tested independently. Across the modules tested before deployment, the detectors average a critical temperature of 478 mK, normal resistance R<SUB>N</SUB> of 1.2Ω , unloaded saturation power of 22.5 pW, (detector-only) optical efficiency of ~ 90%, and have electrothermal time constants &lt; 1 ms in transition., The next generation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments probing for signals of inflation and small angular scale polarization anisotropies require higher sensitivity and better control of systematics. We are developing monolithic arrays of orthomode transducer (OMT) coupled transition edge sensor (TES) polarimeters designed for operation at 150 GHz to address these requirements. OMT coupling allows for simultaneous and independent detection of two orthogonal linear polarization states incident on a single pixel. We present measurements of optical efficiencies η<SUB>op</SUB> of single pixels with on-chip band-defining filters, with η<SUB>op</SUB> = 57+/-4 stat+/-9 sys %. We also provide evidence for an out-of-band blue leak and address possible sources as well as mitigation techniques. Additionally, we discuss methods for increasing efficiency being implemented in the next generation of pixels, currently in fabrication. Still under development, these pixels are produced as monolithic polarimeter arrays and are slated for use in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarization (ACTpol) and South Pole Telescope Polarization (SPTpol) experiments, while single-pixel polarimeters are to be deployed in the Atacama B-mode Search (ABS) experiment., Using archival Chandra and ROSAT data along with numerical simulations, we compare the properties of cool core and non-cool core galaxy clusters, paying particular attention to the region beyond the cluster cores. With the use of single and double β-models, we demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the slopes of observed cluster surface brightness profiles while the cluster cores remain indistinguishable between the two cluster types. Additionally, through the use of hardness ratio profiles, we find evidence suggesting cool core clusters are cooler beyond their cores than non-cool core clusters of comparable mass and temperature, both in observed and simulated clusters. The similarities between real and simulated clusters supports a model presented in earlier work by the authors describing differing merger histories between cool core and non-cool core clusters. Discrepancies between real and simulated clusters will inform upcoming numerical models and simulations as to new ways to incorporate feedback in these systems., To better constrain models of cool core galaxy cluster formation, we have used X-ray observations taken from the Chandra and ROSAT archives to examine the properties of cool core and noncool core clusters, especially beyond the cluster cores. Using an optimized reduction process, we produced X-ray images, surface brightness profiles, and hardness ratio maps of 30 nearby rich Abell clusters (17 cool cores and 13 noncool cores). We show that the use of double β models with cool core surface brightness profiles and single β models for noncool core profiles yield statistically significant differences in the slopes (i.e., β values) of the outer surface brightness profiles, but similar cluster core radii, for the two types of clusters. Hardness ratio profiles as well as spectroscopically fit temperatures suggest that noncool core clusters are warmer than cool core clusters of comparable mass beyond the cluster cores. We compared the properties of these clusters with the results from analogously reduced simulations of 88 numerical clusters created by the adaptive mesh refinement Enzo code. The simulated surface brightness profiles have steeper β-model fits in the outer cluster regions for both cool cores and noncool cores, suggesting additional intracluster medium (ICM) heating is required compared to observed cluster ICMs. Temperature and surface brightness profiles reveal that the simulated clusters are overcooled in their cores. As in the observations, however, simulated hardness ratio and temperature profiles indicate that noncool core clusters are warmer than cool core clusters of comparable mass far beyond the cluster cores. The general similarities between observations and simulations support a model described in Paper I suggesting that noncool core clusters suffered early major mergers destroying nascent cool cores. Differences between simulations and observations will be used to motivate new approaches to feedback in subsequent numerical models.","['arXiv:1707.09353', '10.48550/arXiv.1707.09353', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa9ff4', '2017arXiv170709353H', '2018ApJ...852...97H', '2016AAS...22830110H', '2015AAS...22522002H', '2014AAS...22320401H', '2014PhDT.......145H', '2014PhDT.......399H', 'arXiv:1210.4969', '10.1117/12.927172', '10.48550/arXiv.1210.4969', '2012arXiv1210.4969H', '2012SPIE.8452E..3AH', '10.1117/12.859478', '2010SPIE.7741E..57H', '2010SPIE.7741E..22H', '10.1063/1.3293056', '2009AIPC.1201..282H', '2009arXiv0903.4184H', '10.48550/arXiv.0903.4184', '2009ApJ...697.1597H', 'arXiv:0903.4184', '10.1088/0004-637X/697/2/1597']","[('cluster', 31), ('core', 29), ('polarization', 28), ('sptpol', 24), ('mode', 20), ('temperature', 18), ('cmb', 18), ('power', 15), ('ghz', 15), ('spectrum', 14)]","[(('cool', 'core'), 14), (('power', 'spectrum'), 11), (('core', 'cluster'), 9), (('mode', 'polarization'), 7), (('cosmic', 'microwave'), 7), (('microwave', 'background'), 7), (('background', 'cmb'), 7), (('south', 'pole'), 7), (('noncool', 'core'), 7), (('pole', 'telescope'), 6)]","[(('cosmic', 'microwave', 'background'), 7), (('microwave', 'background', 'cmb'), 7), (('south', 'pole', 'telescope'), 6), (('surface', 'brightness', 'profiles'), 6), (('cool', 'core', 'clusters'), 5), (('high', 'signal', 'noise'), 4), (('transition', 'edge', 'sensor'), 4), (('noncool', 'core', 'clusters'), 4), (('ell', 'ell', 'ell'), 3), (('receiver', 'installed', 'south'), 3)]",Dirty

These results have used a small fraction of the final array, with the array now nearing completion observations are now many times more sensitive. In this talk I will provide an update on progress towards new limits using the completed array which now includes redshifts up to 25. I will also describe new advances in data analysis needed address systematics appearing at new sensitivity levels., Observations of the 21cm hydrogen line in the early universe (redshifts 25 to 5) are expected to shed light on the origins of stars, inflation, and dark matter. First generation interferometers have placed ever-lower limits on the fluctuation power spectrum while measurements of global absorption trough at redshift 18. The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a second generation instrument which aims for a high significance power spectrum measurement between redshifts 5.5 and 12 and experimental observations redshift 18. In 2017 HERA was operated with 20% of its collecting area. This data has been used to develop pipelines and a validation apparatus which has produced new limits on the 21cm power spectrum which offer more constraints on models of early galaxies., The early universe from hydrogen recombination to the earliest observed galaxies is the large stretch of cosmic timeline which has yet to be observed. During this time the dominant baryon is atomic Hydrogen. Though self absorbed in electronic transitions HI is visible in the 21cm radio line which is redshifted to meter wavelengths as it travels to us. First generation instruments like MWA, PAPER, and LOFAR have demonstrated methods for making sensitive instruments. The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a second generation instrument which combines lessons learned from these arrays to target a high significance measurement between redshifts 5.5 to 20. HERA is currently under construction and in use for commissioning observations which are being used to assess the performance of the instrument and calibration strategies. I will report on progress made in construction and the results from these early observations., The redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is a unique probe of the early universe from recombination to the end of reionization. In the theory landscape first stars and black holes competed with exotic physics for primacy in a dense universe; a time which is nearly impossible to observe with any other method. On the basis of this compelling motivation, 21cm observations were given very high priority in the 2010 decadal survey, however little was known about the experimental challenges. In the intervening decade much has been learned from a set of first generation instruments and 2nd gen instruments are now under construction. Challenges include human generated interference, calibration of instrument chromaticity, and foregrounds which are 10000x brighter than the background. Meanwhile, a claimed detection by the EDGES experiment of a global cosmic signature of the cosmic dawn at redshift 17 either challenges the standard cosmological model or the instrumental precision. The unique challenges of making high dynamic range spectroscopic measurements at low frequencies has built into a new branch of radio instrumentation and analysis. In recent years clarity over array design, calibration, and the invention of new tools and practices have continued to improve the quality of results. Meanwhile the iterative experimental process continues with HERA, EDGES3, OV-LWA upgrade, MWA Phase III and others which push boundaries and contribute new data., The redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is a unique probe of the early universe. Challenges include human generated interference, calibration of instrument chromaticity, and foregrounds which are 10000x brighter than the background. All impose large additional covariance. The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) was an experimental array built to tackle these issues with the goal of measuring the power spectrum during the redshift range 6 to 12. Previous analyses of PAPER data have attempted to mitigate systematic covariance by down-weighting covariance determined empirically from the same data. A followup analysis of this pipeline has shown that this is difficult to do correctly and can produce highly biased estimates. In this study an alternate analysis eliminates foreground subtraction and down-weighting steps and uses noise and foreground simulations to validate pipeline outputs in relevant power regimes. This ""simpleDS"" pipeline is used to analyze the power spectrum in the previously studied 100 day observation by the PAPER 64-antenna array across redshift windows ranging from 7 to 11. Though some measurements are consistent with noise, others are not. Among those that are not, bootstrapped error bars also suggest that variation within the data set is also not consistent with noise. Jackknives across local sidereal time and other null tests are used to explore these variations., Multiple instruments are pursuing constraints on dark energy, observing reionization and opening a window on the dark ages through the detection and characterization of the 21 cm hydrogen line for redshifts ranging from ∼1 to 25. These instruments, including CHIME in the sub-meter and HERA in the meter bands, are wide-field arrays with multiple-degree beams, typically operating in transit mode. Accurate knowledge of their primary beams is critical for separation of bright foregrounds from the desired cosmological signals, but difficult to achieve through astronomical observations alone. Previous beam calibration work at low frequencies has focused on model verification and does not address the need of 21 cm experiments for routine beam mapping, to the horizon, of the as-built array. We describe the design and methodology of a drone-mounted calibrator, the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), that aims to address this need. We report on a first set of trials to calibrate low-frequency dipoles at 137 MHz and compare ECHO measurements to an established beam-mapping system based on transmissions from the Orbcomm satellite constellation. We create beam maps of two dipoles at a 9° resolution and find sample noise ranging from 1% at the zenith to 100% in the far sidelobes. Assuming this sample noise represents the error in the measurement, the higher end of this range is not yet consistent with the desired requirement but is an improvement on Orbcomm. The overall performance of ECHO suggests that the desired precision and angular coverage is achievable in practice with modest improvements. We identify the main sources of systematic error and uncertainty in our measurements and describe the steps needed to overcome them., The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a radio interferometer targeting 21cm emission from the primordial intergalactic medium. Observing across a broad redshift range HERA will directly measure the IGM as it is heated and ionized by the first galaxies and black holes. HERA is tuned to make a precision measurement of the HI power spectrum through redshifts 6 to 12, capturing, at high significance, the spatial and temporal pattern of fluctuations imprinted by early objects and will explore beyond to redshift 20 to epochs driven by the very first objects. When completed, the array will have 250 14m dishes packed into a regular hexagonal pattern for roughly 10 times the sensitivity of previous such arrays. HERA is an official Square Kilometer Array precursor operated out of the South African SKA site. It is a staged experimental program that is building out in steps; 19 dishes are operating at the , the next expansion to 37 is under way in parallel with commissioning experiments. Here we report on these tests which have focused on optimizing feed design and calibration techniques and discuss their impact on isolation of foreground emission., Multiple instruments are pursuing constraints on dark energy, observing reionization and opening a window on the dark ages through the detection and characterization of the 21cm hydrogen line across the redshift spectrum, from nearby to z=25. These instruments, including CHIME in the sub-meter and HERA in the meter bands, are wide-field arrays with multiple-degree beams, typically operating in transit mode. Accurate knowledge of their primary beams is critical for separation of bright foregrounds from the desired cosmological signals, but difficult to achieve through astronomical observations alone.

We create beam maps of two dipoles at a 9-degree resolution and find sample noise ranging from 1 to 2%. Assuming this sample noise represents the error in the measurement, the higher end of this range is roughly twice the desired requirement. The overall performance of ECHO suggests that the desired precision and angular coverage is achievable in practice with modest improvements. We identify the main sources of systematic error and uncertainty in our measurements and describe the steps needed to overcome them., We present the 21 cm power spectrum analysis approach of the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionization project. In this paper, we compare the outputs of multiple pipelines for the purpose of validating statistical limits cosmological hydrogen at redshifts between 6 and 12. Multiple independent data calibration and reduction pipelines are used to make power spectrum limits on a fiducial night of data. Comparing the outputs of imaging and power spectrum stages highlights differences in calibration, foreground subtraction, and power spectrum calculation. The power spectra found using these different methods span a space defined by the various tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and systematic control. Lessons learned from comparing the pipelines range from the algorithmic to the prosaically mundane; all demonstrate the many pitfalls of neglecting reproducibility. We briefly discuss the way these different methods attempt to handle the question of evaluating a significant detection in the presence of foregrounds., Direct observation of cosmological hydrogen throughout cosmic time is possible via the 21cm line and is now being pursued as a new cosmological and astrophysical probe. Multiple experimental low frequency radio arrays have worked towards detection and characterization of this spectral line signal through many different epochs of cosmic time. The Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the first stars ionized the primordial hydrogen half a billion years after the big bang, thought to occur between redshifts 6 and 12 is a period of intense interest. The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) has placed a series of ever more sensitive limits on the 21cm power spectrum while the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has pioneered imaging of structure in the presence of foregrounds. Here we present the latest results from these experiments and introduce the next generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) which will yield 20 times the sensitivity of first generation arrays and provide new constraints on the nature of the first stars, the evolution of primordial galaxies, and significant new constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters., The epoch of the reionization (EoR) power spectrum is expected to evolve strongly with redshift, and it is this variation with cosmic history that will allow us to begin to place constraints on the physics of reionization. The primary obstacle to the measurement of the EoR power spectrum is bright foreground emission. We present an analysis of observations from the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) telescope, which place new limits on the H i power spectrum over the redshift range of 7.5\lt z\lt 10.5, extending previously published single-redshift results to cover the full range accessible to the instrument. To suppress foregrounds, we use filtering techniques that take advantage of the large instrumental bandwidth to isolate and suppress foreground leakage into the interesting regions of k-space. Our 500 hr integration is the longest such yet recorded and demonstrates this method to a dynamic range of 10<SUP>4</SUP>. Power spectra at different points across the redshift range reveal the variable efficacy of the foreground isolation. Noise-limited measurements of Δ<SUP>2</SUP> at k = 0.2 hr Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> and z = 7.55 reach as low as (48 mK)<SUP>2</SUP> (1σ). We demonstrate that the size of the error bars in our power spectrum measurement as generated by a bootstrap method is consistent with the fluctuations due to thermal noise. Relative to this thermal noise, most spectra exhibit an excess of power at a few sigma. The likely sources of this excess include residual foreground leakage, particularly at the highest redshift, unflagged radio frequency interference, and calibration errors. We conclude by discussing data reduction improvements that promise to remove much of this excess., We present a catalog of spectral measurements covering a 100-200 MHz band for 32 sources, derived from observations with a 64 antenna deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. For transit telescopes such as PAPER, calibration of the primary beam is a difficult endeavor and errors in this calibration are a major source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to decrease our reliance on an accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources in a narrow declination range from -46° to -40°. Since sources at similar declinations follow nearly identical paths through the primary beam, this restriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating from higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte Carlo fit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and measurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER measurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at nearby declinations; 90% are found to confirm and refine a power-law model for flux density. Of particular importance is the new Pictor A flux model, which is accurate to 1.4% and shows that between 100 MHz and 2 GHz, in contrast with previous models, the spectrum of Pictor A is consistent with a single power law given by a flux at 150 MHz of 382 ± 5.4 Jy and a spectral index of -0.76 ± 0.01. This accuracy represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous measurements in this band and is limited by the uncertainty in the catalog measurements used to estimate the absolute flux scale. The simplicity and improved accuracy of Pictor A's spectrum make it an excellent calibrator in a band important for experiments seeking to measure 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization., As observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in redshifted 21 cm emission begin, we assess the accuracy of the early catalog results from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA). The MWA EoR approach derives much of its sensitivity from subtracting foregrounds to &lt;1% precision, while the PAPER approach relies on the stability and symmetry of the primary beam. Both require an accurate flux calibration to set the amplitude of the measured power spectrum. The two instruments are very similar in resolution, sensitivity, sky coverage, and spectral range and have produced catalogs from nearly contemporaneous data. We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method to estimate that the two instruments are on the same flux scale to within 20% and find that the images are mostly in good agreement. We then investigate the source of the errors by comparing two overlapping MWA facets where we find that the differences are primarily related to an inaccurate model of the primary beam but also correlated errors in bright sources due to CLEAN. We conclude with suggestions for mitigating and better characterizing these effects., Exploration of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in the redshifted 21cm radio band will require exquisite instrumental precision and careful cross-checking of observations by multiple instruments. The EoR signal will be a small spatial and spectral variation beneath bright foreground sources. Separation of foregrounds is expected to be the dominant source of uncertainty. Meanwhile, agreement between EoR telescopes is crucial to verifying possible detections. We compare MWA and PAPER catalogs made during early commissioning periods in 2010. These observations occurred near in time, in overlapping portions of the sky, using similar configurations and bandwidths. These similarities reduce possible disagreement due to time variation, spectral slope, resolution and confusion. Using overlapping MWA images we assess the variation within the sample of MWA fluxes then measure the variation between PAPER and MWA. We also use the MWA32 data set to estimate the uncertainties of methodological differences like photometry and mosaicing. These contribute only about 4% error. An apparent primary beam error contributes 20 to 80% uncertainty while the brightest sources have dramatically higher error (closer to 50%) when near the brightest source in the field. Though errors of this type occur in both catalogs, the fluxes from PAPER and the MWA robustly agree in flux to within 20%. Though this scale of error is not atypical of low frequency flux measurements, simulations of source removal and EoR foregrounds have heretofore assumed perfect removal of sources at this flux scale., Nearly half a billion years passed between the release of the now routinely observed Comic Microwave Backrgound and the formation of the first galaxies and black holes which reionized the ubiquitous hydrogen. This Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the next major unexplored cosmological milestone. At the current time the space between galaxies is almost completely ionized, therefor we know that the universe must have undergone a global phase transition. The nature of the ionizing sources, whether young galaxies or accreting massive black holes is unknown. Neither do we know when this reionization occured or how long it took. Models suggest that we can detect fluctuations in the 21cm hydrogen emission line as ionization proceeds and high contrast ionized holes are carved in the neutral hydrogen. Detecting these fluctuations is one of the few direct probes of the reionization process but is a difficult task requiring a new generation of low frequency radio telescopes. Motivated by the breadth of unknowns, the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) has been slowly building in complexity while folding the results of observations back into improving the design and operation of the telescope. As part of this process, this thesis analyzes early observations to explore three major areas of concern in detecting EoR: contamination by foreground sources, calibration stability and limiting sensitivity. Catalogs produced from this early data show good agreement with previous measurements. We conclude that the calibration is stable and sensitivity floors are close to the expected theoretical levels., We present observations from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa, observed in 2010 May and September. Using two nights of drift scanning with PAPER's 60° FWHM beam we have made a map covering the entire sky below +10° declination with an effective center frequency of 145 MHz, a 70 MHz bandwidth, and a resolution of 26'. A 4800 deg<SUP>2</SUP> region of this large map with the lowest Galactic emission reaches an rms of 0.7 Jy. We establish an absolute flux scale using sources from the 160 MHz Culgoora catalog. Using the 408 MHz Molonglo Reference Catalog (MRC) as a finding survey, we identify counterparts to 480 sources in our maps and compare our fluxes to the MRC and to 332 sources in the Culgoora catalog. For both catalogs, the ratio of PAPER to catalog flux averages to 1, with a standard deviation of 50%. This measured variation is consistent with comparisons between independent catalogs observed at different bands. The PAPER data represent new 145 MHz flux measurements for a large number of sources in the band expected to encompass cosmic reionization and represents a significant step toward establishing a model for removing foregrounds to the reionization signal.","['2024AAS...24345203J', '2022AAS...24031407J', '2020AAS...23630804J', '2020anms.conf....9J', '2019AAS...23341303J', '2017PASP..129c5002J', '10.1088/1538-3873/aa56b9', '2017AAS...22912503J', '10.48550/arXiv.1610.02607', '2016arXiv161002607J', 'arXiv:1610.02607', '10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/114', 'arXiv:1605.06978', '10.48550/arXiv.1605.06978', '2016ApJ...825..114J', '2016arXiv160506978J', '2016APS..APRS12003J', 'arXiv:1408.3389', '2014arXiv1408.3389P', '2015ApJ...801...51J', '10.48550/arXiv.1408.3389', '10.1088/0004-637X/801/1/51', '2014arXiv1408.3389J', '2013arXiv1307.7716J', 'arXiv:1307.7716', '2013ApJ...776..108J', '10.48550/arXiv.1307.7716', '10.1088/0004-637X/776/2/108', '10.1088/0004-637X/769/1/5', '2013ApJ...769....5J', '2013arXiv1303.2107J', 'arXiv:1303.2107', '10.48550/arXiv.1303.2107', '2013AAS...22110808J', '2011PhDT........59J', '2011PhDT.......141J', '2011ApJ...734L..34J', '2011arXiv1105.1367J', '10.48550/arXiv.1105.1367', 'arXiv:1105.1367', '10.1088/2041-8205/734/2/L34']","[('array', 31), ('reionization', 27), ('spectrum', 25), ('source', 25), ('power', 23), ('measurement', 23), ('redshift', 22), ('epoch', 21), ('foreground', 21), ('hydrogen', 20)]","[(('epoch', 'reionization'), 19), (('power', 'spectrum'), 19), (('low', 'frequency'), 7), (('precision', 'array'), 7), (('array', 'probing'), 7), (('probing', 'epoch'), 7), (('reionization', 'paper'), 7), (('primary', 'beam'), 7), (('hydrogen', 'epoch'), 6), (('array', 'hera'), 6)]","[(('precision', 'array', 'probing'), 7), (('array', 'probing', 'epoch'), 7), (('probing', 'epoch', 'reionization'), 7), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'paper'), 7), (('hydrogen', 'epoch', 'reionization'), 6), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'array'), 5), (('reionization', 'array', 'hera'), 5), (('cm', 'hydrogen', 'line'), 5), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'eor'), 5), (('cm', 'power', 'spectrum'), 4)]",Dirty

Building on the success of our 2017 citizen science experiment, our team organized 85 Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast Initiative (DEB) observation sites: 70 teams spread along the path of totality from Mexico though the United States to Newfoundland as well as 15 teams located outside the path of totality. With identical equipment and training procedures, sites collected two types of data: full disk images of the sun during partiality and wider field of view coronal images during totality. Images were shared with our partners, NASA EDGE and SolarSTEAM, and uploaded to create a live broadcast of the eclipse. Site volunteer teams came from high schools, universities, informal astronomy groups, and local community organizations, many receiving equipment and training at no cost through funding from the NASA Science Mission Directorate, the National Science foundation, and Einstein's Incredible Universe. <P />With the eclipse about two months behind us, here we report on how it went, including the number of sites with good weather and successful data collection, the total impact of related outreach events, and some initial scientific results. We'll share plans to use this new, experienced citizen science observer network for ongoing solar and celestial research projects, including observations of solar flares, exoplanet transits, stellar occultations, and light curves of variables stars and asteroids. Finally, we'll share some of the challenges and lessons learned in creating a network of volunteer astronomical observers that is diverse in experience and geographically dispersed., Here we present a progress report on the Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast Initiative (DEB-I) in preparation for the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse. This citizen-science project builds upon the success of the 2017 eclipse experiment, which imaged the inner solar corona in white light for more than 90 minutes using a network of 68 identical telescopes spaced along the 2,500 mile path of totality (Penn et al. 2019). Volunteer observers came from high schools, universities, informal astronomy groups, and more. The DEB Initiative aims to reproduce that success along with a new real-time dynamic broadcast of the corona during the eclipse and the creation of a network of citizen scientists to conduct high speed continuum observations of the Sun during the peak of Solar Cycle 25. This poster will include results from the 2017 experiment, the final technical specifications of the 2024 DEB-I equipment, the status of volunteer teams for 2024, and a report on the initial practice run observations of the October 2023 annular eclipse. During the 2024 total eclipse, the DEB Initiative will be able to measure the acceleration of plasma in the lower corona of the sun. This innermost region corona is only accessible in white light during a total solar eclipse. DEB-I will expand upon on the excitement generated by our volunteer observers for the 2024 eclipse by making additional use of the telescopes and equipment before and after the event. Additional science goals of the DEB-I network beyond the eclipse include: 60 milli-second observations of large white-light solar flares in Solar Cycle 25, synoptic monitoring of exoplanet transit timing, variable star and asteroid light curve measurements, and occultation observations of bright stars using a continental-scale baseline., As educators, we want our students to learn from their mistakes and strive for excellence. Though we may embrace a growth mindset, traditional grading practices are at odds with these ideals. By averaging assessment performance over time, students have little incentive to re-study previously-tested material and the grades of students who begin the course with a different skill set than their peers are negatively impacted even if they improve over time. I will share ways that I have implemented a form of standards-based testing in two different classes. In this system, about 20-30 clearly defined learning goals are tested over the course of the semester in an in-class, proctored exam setting. Examples of learning goals range from the algorithmic (e.g. ""Approximate a function using the first few non-zero terms of a Taylor Series"") to the more broadly defined (e.g. ""Apply the impulse-momentum theorem to a real-life situation, quantitatively or qualitatively, even if the force is not constant""). Students are awarded credit for each individual goal on a pass-fail basis: either the student demonstrated they have achieved the goal, or they did not, yet. This high standard is accompanied with opportunities for students to reflect upon unachieved goals and attempt them again. In this way, a student's grade is a reflection of how many of the learning goals they completed by the end of the course. Students who demonstrate growth are not penalized for the time it takes to achieve learning goals from the earlier part of the course. Though this method does present logistical challenges for the instructor, they can be overcome in the name of simplifying the grading process (without awarding partial credit), holding students to high standards, and providing flexibility to students who encounter but overcome difficulties. By clearly defining learning goals and allowing students multiple attempts to demonstrate proficiency, our grading practices can reflect a growth mindset., Many introductory astronomy students are surprised to learn that the images from the Hubble Space Telescope don't simply appear fully formed straight out of the telescope. In addition to the careful calibration and precision required, students also underestimate the artistry and creativity that go into these beautiful, iconic images. Here I share an hour-long in-class lab exercise that walks students through the use of the free online JS9-4L image processor to create a representative color image of the Lagoon Nebula. In the accompanying out-of-class project, students choose from a number of data sets of FITS images from Hubble, create their own representative color image, and write a research paper about their chosen object and their imaging process. I will share the curriculum that I use to introduce these topics, the lab and project instructions, and samples of student images and responses. This interdisciplinary curriculum emphasizes quantitative reasoning, solidifies student understanding of light, spectra, and imaging, introduces new astronomical objects (e.g. colliding galaxies or planetary nebulae), teaches students about the artistry of astronomical imaging, promotes student agency, and enhances research and writing skills., We consider the employment prospects of those with advanced degrees in astronomy and astrophysics within and outside academia over the coming decade, and offer recommendations aimed at ensuring there continues to exist a robust, diverse set of career options for those with graduate training in astronomy and astrophysics in the 2020s., Increased exposure to artificial light at night is a factor in increased health risks, energy waste, and damage to wildlife ecosystems. We have set up identical sky quality meters (SQMs) in two locations in Utah for comparison of one bright and one dark night sky locations. One SQM is at the rooftop observatory on the South Physics Building on the University of Utah's urban campus; the other is located at Dead Horse Point State Park in eastern Utah. In both cases, a Unihedron SQM-LU was mounted on a tripod and attached to an Internet connected computer housed in a utility box. The measurement of zenith sky quality, in magnitudes per square arcsecond, is recorded every five minutes and updates a file in a shared OneDrive folder. Monthly data will be added to the Globe at Night Monitoring Network (GaN-MN) for public availability to allow researchers to understand trends in the sky brightness over extended periods of time as Salt Lake City continues to grow. We present designs for a web widget which would include a live reading of the night sky quality using easy to understand visuals. Interacting with the widget would direct the user to additional information about night sky preservation. Such a widget could increase public awareness of night sky conditions and be included on the websites of local weather stations or community groups involved in night sky preservation. In addition to this widget, we will present possible uses of the simple SQM data reports for incorporation into secondary science and introductory college classrooms, including some preliminary lab activities. The goal of these activities is for students to practice data science skills in Excel or Python with real sky quality data that is relevant to their personal lives., Modeling of the spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of the CO molecule can reveal the physical conditions (temperature and density) of molecular gas in Galactic clouds and other galaxies. Recently, the Herschel Space Observatory and ALMA have offered, for the first time, a comprehensive view of the rotational J = 4-3 through J = 13-12 lines, which arise from a complex, diverse range of physical conditions that must be simplified to one, two, or three components when modeled. Here we investigate the recoverability of physical conditions from SLEDs produced by galaxy evolution simulations containing a large dynamical range in physical properties. These simulated SLEDs were generally fit well by one component of gas whose properties largely resemble or slightly underestimate the luminosity-weighted properties of the simulations when clumping due to nonthermal velocity dispersion is taken into account. If only modeling the first three rotational lines, the median values of the marginalized parameter distributions better represent the luminosity-weighted properties of the simulations, but the uncertainties in the fitted parameters are nearly an order of magnitude, compared to approximately 0.2 dex in the “best-case” scenario of a fully sampled SLED through J = 10-9. This study demonstrates that while common CO SLED modeling techniques cannot reveal the underlying complexities of the molecular gas, they can distinguish bulk luminosity-weighted properties that vary with star formation surface densities and galaxy evolution, if a sufficient number of lines are detected and modeled., Version last updated June 2016. Papers through at least 2018 used this version., Molecular gas is the raw material for star formation, and like the interstellar medium (ISM) in general, it can exist in regions of higher and lower excitation. Rotational transitions of the CO molecule are bright and sensitive to cold molecular gas. While the majority of the molecular gas exists in the very cold component traced by CO J=1-0, the higher-J lines trace the highly excited gas that may be more indicative of star formation processes. The atmosphere is opaque to these lines, but the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory made them accessible for study of Galactic and extragalactic sources. We have conducted two-component, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modeling of the CO lines from J=1-0 through J=13-12 in 87 galaxies observed by the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS). We used the nested sampling algorithm Multinest to compare the measured CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) to the ones produced by a custom version of the non-LTE code RADEX. This allowed us to fully examine the degeneracies in parameter space for kinetic temperature, molecular gas density, CO column density, and area filling factor.Here we discuss the major findings of our study, as well as the important implications of two-component molecular gas modeling. The average pressure of the warm gas is slightly correlated with galaxy LFIR, but that of the cold gas is not. A high-J (such as J=11-10) to J=1-0 line ratio is diagnostic of warm component pressure. We find a very large spread in our derived values of ""alpha-CO,"" with no discernable trend with LFIR, and average molecular gas depletion times that decrease with LFIR. If only a few molecular lines are available in a galaxy's SLED, the limited ability to model only one component will change the results. A one-component fit often underestimates the flux of carbon monoxide (CO) J=1-0 and the mass. If low-J lines are not included, mass is underestimated by an order of magnitude. Even when modeling the low-J lines alone or using a CO-to-mass conversion factor, the mass should be considered to be uncertain to a factor of at least 0.4 dex, and the vast majority of the CO luminosity will be missed (median, 65 per cent)., We have conducted two-component, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium modelling of the CO lines from J = 1-0 through J = 13-12 in 87 galaxies observed by the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS). We find the average pressure of the cold molecular gas, traced especially by CO J = 1-0, is ∼10<SUP>5.0±0.5</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The mid- to high-J lines of CO trace higher pressure gas at 10<SUP>6.5 ± 0.6</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>; this pressure is slightly correlated with L<SUB>FIR</SUB>. Two components are often necessary to accurately fit the Spectral Line Energy Distributions; a one-component fit often underestimates the flux of carbon monoxide (CO) J = 1-0 and the mass. If low-J lines are not included, mass is underestimated by an order of magnitude. Even when modelling the low-J lines alone or using an α<SUB>CO</SUB> conversion factor, the mass should be considered to be uncertain to a factor of at least 0.4 dex, and the vast majority of the CO luminosity will be missed (median, 65 per cent). We find a very large spread in our derived values of α<SUB>CO</SUB>, though they do not have a discernible trend with L<SUB>FIR</SUB>; the best fit is a constant 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (K km s<SUP>- 1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>, with a standard deviation of 0.36 dex, and a range of 0.3-1.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (K km s<SUP>- 1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. We find average molecular gas depletion times (τ<SUB>dep</SUB>) of 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr that decrease with increasing star formation rate. Finally, we note that the J = 11-10/J = 1-0 line flux ratio is diagnostic of the warm component pressure, and discuss the implications of this comprehensive study of SPIRE FTS extragalactic spectra for future study post-Herschel., We compiled a list of successful extragalactic Herschel/SPIRE FTS proposals (301 spectra) and searched the Herschel Science Archive (HSA) for the available data. Table 1 lists the basic galaxy information and observation IDs for all galaxies for which at least one FTS line measurement or upper limit is reported. <P />The bandpass of the Herschel FTS starts around the CO J=4-3 line, but the majority of the molecular mass in galaxies is cool and populates the lower rotational levels. We complement the line fluxes derived from the FTS with the CO J=1-0, J=2-1, and J=3-2 lines available from ground-based observatories. Many of these galaxies have already been studied in the literature, particularly in large CO surveys. <P />For some galaxies, we also performed single-dish measurements using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). Measurements of the CO J=1-0 line were conducted with the 12m dish on Kitt Peak in 2015 May, and those of CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 were conducted with the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mt. Graham from 2014 November to 2015 February. <P />(4 data files)., We present a catalog of all CO (J = 4-3 through J = 13-12), [C I], and [N II] lines available from extragalactic spectra from the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) archive combined with observations of the low-J CO lines from the literature and from the Arizona Radio Observatory. This work examines the relationships between L <SUB>FIR</SUB>, {L}<SUB>{{CO</SUB>}}<SUP>\prime </SUP>, and L <SUB>CO</SUB>/L <SUB>CO,1-0</SUB>. We also present a new method for estimating probability distribution functions from marginal signal-to-noise ratio Herschel FTS spectra, which takes into account the instrumental “ringing” and the resulting highly correlated nature of the spectra. The slopes of log(L <SUB>FIR</SUB>) versus log({L}<SUB>{{CO</SUB>}}<SUP>\prime </SUP>) are linear for all mid- to high-J CO lines and slightly sublinear if restricted to (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs). The mid- to high-J CO luminosity relative to CO J = 1-0 increases with increasing L <SUB>FIR</SUB>, indicating higher excitement of the molecular gas, although these ratios do not exceed ∼180. For a given bin in L <SUB>FIR</SUB>, the luminosities relative to CO J = 1-0 remain relatively flat from J = 6-5 through J = 13-12, across three orders of magnitude of L <SUB>FIR</SUB>. A single component theoretical photodissociation region (PDR) model cannot match these flat SLED shapes, although combinations of PDR models with mechanical heating added qualitatively match the shapes, indicating the need for further comprehensive modeling of the excitation processes of warm molecular gas in nearby galaxies., Our new ability to comprehensively model CO emission from J=1-0 to J=13-12 is one legacy of the SPIRE FTS onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Much attention has been paid to this dataset by both theorists and observers, due to these lines' ability to probe the warm, highly excited molecular gas that may be associated with star formation. We are investigating the CO excitation ladders produced by the numerical simulations of disc galaxies and galaxy mergers (Narayanan and Krumholz 2014). Using one- and two-component non-LTE RADEX models, we compare the physical conditions derived from modeling the unresolved CO as SPIRE observers would with the known gas properties and distributions of the simulations. Our goal is to better understand the meaning of the derived physical conditions when modeling unresolved continuous gas distributions as discrete physical components over the CO ladder., Molecular gas is the raw material for star formation and is commonly traced by the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule. The atmosphere blocks all but the lowest-J transitions of CO for observatories on the ground, but the launch of the Herschel Space Observatory revealed the CO emission of nearby galaxies from J = 4-3 to J = 13-12. Herschel showed that mid- and high-J CO lines in nearby galaxies are emitted from warm gas, accounting for approximately 10% of the molecular mass, but the majority of the CO luminosity. The energy budget of this warm, highly-excited gas is a significant window into the feedback interactions among molecular gas, star formation, and galaxy evolution. Likely, mechanical heating is required to explain the excitation. Such gas has also been observed in star forming regions within our galaxy. <P />We have examined all ~300 spectra of galaxies from the Herschel Fourier Transform Spectrometer and measured line fluxes or upper limits for the CO J = 4-3 to J = 13-12, [CI], and [NII] 205 micron lines in ~200 galaxies, taking systematic effects of the FTS into account. We will present our line fitting method, illustrate trends available so far in this large sample, and preview the full 2-component radiative transfer likelihood modeling of the CO emission using an illustrative sample of 20 galaxies, including comparisons to well-resolved galactic regions. This work is a comprehensive study of mid- and high-J CO emission among a variety of galaxy types, and can be used as a resource for future (sub)millimeter studies of galaxies with ground-based instruments., Molecular gas is the raw material for star formation and is commonly traced by the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule.

This work is a comprehensive study of mid- and high-J CO emission among a variety of galaxy types, and can be used as a resource for future (sub)millimeter studies of galaxies with ground-based instruments., We present Herschel-SPIRE imaging spectroscopy (194-671 μm) of the bright starburst galaxy M82. We use RADEX and a Bayesian Likelihood Analysis to simultaneously model the temperature, density, column density, and filling factor of both the cool and warm components of molecular gas traced by the entire CO ladder up to J=13-12. The high-J lines observed by SPIRE trace much warmer gas (~500 K) than those observable from the ground. The addition of <SUP>13</SUP>CO (and [C I]) is new and indicates that [C I] may be tracing different gas than <SUP>12</SUP>CO. At such a high temperature, cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen; we conclude with a discussion on the possible excitation processes in this warm component. Photon-dominated region (PDR) models require significantly higher densities than those indicated by our Bayesian likelihood analysis in order to explain the high-J CO line ratios, though cosmic-ray enhanced PDR models can do a better job reproducing the emission at lower densities. Shocks and turbulent heating are likely required to explain the bright high-J emission., We have completed an initial pilot study of 17 galaxies (21 pointings) of molecular gas in nearby galaxies using CO rotational lines from J=1-0 to J=13-12; we are beginning to apply our methods to up to 150 galaxies observed with the Herschel SPIRE FTS. Observations to such high frequency in CO were unavailable until the launch of Herschel. This sample has a range of galaxy types (starburst galaxies, AGN, and elliptical galaxies) and far-infrared luminosities. The physical properties (temperature, density and mass) of the molecular gas are derived using non-LTE excitation modeling of CO. Dust properties (temperature and mass) are derived from SPIRE and IRAS/ISO/Spitzer archival photometry. The gas and dust properties will be compared as a function of galaxy type and far-infrared luminosity and will be used to ascertain the dominant excitation mechanism of the warm molecular gas and assess the effects of feedback from star formation and AGN in galaxies.Our results find that CO is emitted from a low-pressure/high-mass component traced by the low-J lines and a high-pressure/low-mass component (kinetic temperatures of 100s of K) which dominates the luminosity. The CO J=6-5 line primarily arises in the warm component and its line luminosity is well correlated with the total CO luminosity. That transition, and other mid- to high-J, can be used as a reliable tracer of warm molecular emission. We find gas-to-dust-mass ratios &lt; 120. We will discuss systematic effects of single-component and multi-component CO modeling. Through comparison to Galactic molecular emission, we show the molecular interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is not simply an ensemble of Galactic-type GMCs. The warm gas emission is likely dominated by regions resembling the warm extended cloud of Sgr B2., The <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 4 → 3 to J = 13 → 12 lines of the interstellar medium from nearby galaxies, newly observable with the Herschel SPIRE Fourier transform spectrometer, offer an opportunity to study warmer, more luminous molecular gas than that traced by <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 1 → 0. Here we present a survey of 17 nearby infrared-luminous galaxy systems (21 pointings). In addition to photometric modeling of dust, we modeled full <SUP>12</SUP>CO spectral line energy distributions from J = 1 → 0 to J = 13 → 12 with two components of warm and cool CO gas, and included LTE analysis of [C I], [C II], [N II], and H<SUB>2</SUB> lines. CO is emitted from a low-pressure/high-mass component traced by the low-J lines and a high-pressure/low-mass component that dominates the luminosity. We found that, on average, the ratios of the warm/cool pressure, mass, and <SUP>12</SUP>CO luminosity are 60 ± 30, 0.11 ± 0.02, and 15.6 ± 2.7. The gas-to-dust-mass ratios are &lt;120 throughout the sample. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO luminosity is dominated by the high-J lines and is 4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> L <SUB>FIR</SUB> on average. We discuss systematic effects of single-component and multi-component CO modeling (e.g., single-component J &lt;= 3 models overestimate gas pressure by ~0.5 dex), as well as compare to Galactic star-forming regions. With this comparison, we show the molecular interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is not simply an ensemble of Galactic-type giant molecular clouds. The warm gas emission is likely dominated by regions resembling the warm extended cloud of Sgr B2., Molecular gas is the raw material of star formation. The 12CO J=1→0 line is well known to trace the bulk of the cool molecular gas in the interstellar medium of nearby galaxies. New data from the Herschel Space Observatory, however, indicates that higher-energy CO rotational lines (e.g. CO J=6→5) are emitted from significantly warmer molecular gas. Studying this warmer, more luminous gas can provide useful clues for understanding the excitation of molecular gas by star formation. This work establishes a pipeline to simultaneously model the physical conditions of cool and warm CO gas using the CO spectral line energy distributions from J=1→0 to J=13→12. We confirm that, in a variety of galaxies, CO is emitted from a low-pressure/high-mass component traced by the low-J lines and a high-pressure/low-mass component that dominates the luminosity. An initial survey of 17 infrared-luminous galaxy systems observed by the Herschel-SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) investigates how the physical properties and excitation mechanisms of the warm/cool CO vary with total infrared luminosity, dust mass, atomic fine-structure emission, and more. This work includes an in-depth discussion of the systematic effects of two-component CO modeling as well as comparisons of the derived physical conditions to those of Galactic star-forming regions and high-redshift submillimeter galaxies., The lowest-energy rotational lines of CO are well-known to trace cool, star-forming molecular gas. The Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) observed, for the first time, CO's higher-energy J=4-3 to J=13-12 lines in nearby galaxies. The higher-J lines are more luminous than expected and arise from a warmer, diffuse component of molecular gas. Because such gas dominates the total energy output of CO, it is key to studying ongoing questions of feedback interactions between the ISM, star formation, and AGN. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive survey of the molecular gas/dust of nearby galaxies observed with the FTS, complemented by low-J CO and photometric data. Full results are presented for twenty well-known galaxies as well as some preliminary results for all three hundred FTS galaxies, utilizing a consistent correction for source-beam coupling. Via radiative transfer modeling of CO (pressure and mass), the warm and cool components of CO gas are simultaneously modeled and compared by galaxy type, luminosity, and (specific) star formation rate. This work demonstrates that simultaneous modeling is necessary; low-J lines alone overestimate gas pressure (but consistently determine cold CO mass). We also sought to determine the diagnostic power of an individual high-J line for future galaxy observations for which few CO lines are available; the J=6-5 line, observable with ALMA, is a useful proxy for the warm gas luminosity and mass. Special emphasis is placed on M82 and our finding, consistent with an emerging picture among other galaxies, that high-J CO excitation cannot be explained by photon-dominated regions (PDRs), as low-J excitation can in this galaxy. Instead, mechanical/turbulent heating must play a role. We also discuss atomic fine structure lines ([CI], [CII], [NII]), dust properties, and comparisons to high-z submillimeter galaxies. Finally, we apply the same techniques to the newly discovered rotational CO emission in the debris of SN1987A, revealing more CO mass than previously detected. Because nearby galaxies can be studied in greater detail, characterizing their molecular gas properties is necessary to understand the growing population of distant submillimeter galaxies., We report spectroscopic and imaging observations of rotational transitions of cold CO and SiO in the ejecta of SN1987A, the first such emission detected in a supernova remnant. In addition to line luminosities for the CO J = 1-0, 2-1, 6-5, and 7-6 transitions, we present upper limits for all other transitions up to J = 13-12, collectively measured from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment, and the Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver. Simple models show the lines are emitted from at least 0.01 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of CO at a temperature &gt;14 K, confined within at most 35% of a spherical volume expanding at ~2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Moreover, we locate the emission within 1'' of the central debris. These observations, along with a partial observation of SiO, confirm the presence of cold molecular gas within supernova remnants and provide insight into the physical conditions and chemical processes in the ejecta. Furthermore, we demonstrate the powerful new window into supernova ejecta offered by submillimeter observations., We present new Herschel-SPIRE imaging spectroscopy (194-671 μm) of the bright starburst galaxy M82. Covering the CO ladder from J = 4 → 3 to J = 13 → 12, spectra were obtained at multiple positions for a fully sampled ~3 × 3 arcmin map, including a longer exposure at the central position. We present measurements of <SUP>12</SUP>CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, [C I], [N II], HCN, and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> in emission, along with OH<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUP>+</SUP>, and HF in absorption and H<SUB>2</SUB>O in both emission and absorption, with discussion. We use a radiative transfer code and Bayesian likelihood analysis to model the temperature, density, column density, and filling factor of multiple components of molecular gas traced by <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO, adding further evidence to the high-J lines tracing a much warmer (~500 K), less massive component than the low-J lines. The addition of <SUP>13</SUP>CO (and [C I]) is new and indicates that [C I] may be tracing different gas than <SUP>12</SUP>CO. No temperature/density gradients can be inferred from the map, indicating that the single-pointing spectrum is descriptive of the bulk properties of the galaxy. At such a high temperature, cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen. Photon-dominated region (PDR) models require higher densities than those indicated by our Bayesian likelihood analysis in order to explain the high-J CO line ratios, though cosmic-ray-enhanced PDR models can do a better job reproducing the emission at lower densities. Shocks and turbulent heating are likely required to explain the bright high-J emission., We present new Herschel-SPIRE imaging spectroscopy (194-671 micron) of the bright starburst galaxy M82. Covering the CO ladder from J=4-3 to J=13-12, these spectra were obtained at multiple positions for a fully sampled 3 x 3 arcminute map, as well as a longer exposure at the central position. We use RADEX and a Bayesian Likelihood Analysis to model the temperature, density, column density, and filling factor of the molecular gas traced by the high-J CO transitions unavailable from the ground. We add further evidence to these lines tracing a much warmer component (&gt; 500 K) than low-J lines.

We develop a pipeline for the generation of a synthetic ground truth/OCR dataset to correct the OCR results of the astrophysics literature holdings of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). By mining the arXiv we create, to the authors' knowledge, the largest scientific synthetic ground truth/OCR post correction dataset of 203,354,393 character pairs. We provide baseline models trained with this dataset and find the mean improvement in character and word error rates of 7.71% and 18.82% for historical OCR text, respectively. When used to classify parts of sentences as inline math, we find a classification F1 score of 77.82%. Interactive dashboards to explore the dataset are available online: https://readingtimemachine.github.io/projects/1-ocr-groundtruth-may2023, and data and code, within the limitations of our agreement with the arXiv, are hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/ReadingTimeMachine/ocr_post_correction., Scientific articles published prior to the ""age of digitization"" in the late 1990s contain figures which are ""trapped"" within their scanned pages. While progress to extract figures and their captions has been made, there is currently no robust method for this process. We present a YOLO-based method for use on scanned pages, after they have been processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which uses both grayscale and OCR-features. We focus our efforts on translating the intersection-over-union (IOU) metric from the field of object detection to document layout analysis and quantify ""high localization"" levels as an IOU of 0.9. When applied to the astrophysics literature holdings of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), we find F1 scores of 90.9% (92.2%) for figures (figure captions) with the IOU cut-off of 0.9 which is a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art methods., Scientific articles published prior to the ""age of digitization"" in the late 1990s contain figures which are ""trapped"" within their scanned pages.

Our models examine the competing effects of energy and mass supply from the various components of the evolved stellar population for globular clusters 47 Tucanae, M15, NGC 6440, and NGC 6752. Ignoring all other gas evacuation processes, we find that the energy output from the stars that have recently turned off the main sequence are capable of effectively clearing the evolved stellar ejecta and producing intracluster gas densities consistent with current observational constraints. This result distinguishes a viable gas and dust evacuation mechanism that is ubiquitous among globular clusters. In addition, we extend our analysis to probe the efficiency of pulsar wind feedback in globular clusters. We find that if the energy supplied by the pulsar winds is effectively thermalized within the intracluster medium, the material would become unbound. The detection of intracluster ionized gas in 47 Tucanae allows us to place particularly strict limits on pulsar wind thermalization efficiency, which must be extremely low in the cluster's core in order to be in accordance with the observed density constraints., We will create several science-ready data products to help astronomers search the literature in new ways. We will accomplish this goal by extending the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), known as an invaluable literature resource, into a series of data resources. In 2011 the NASA ADAP program funded the ADS All-Sky Survey (ADSASS) project. Motivated by a similar broad vision as ours, it used the ADS archive of scanned historical astronomical articles, focusing on a uniquely rich vein in the astronomical literature: sky imagery. By extracting and astrotagging old images (finding their place on the sky), previously dead data could become science-ready once again. While this initial effort bore significant fruit, only 0.1% of the 3.2 million images in the ADS corpus were ultimately astrotagged. The publicly-available ADSASS ADAP proposal envisioned text-mining figure captions for source information in the remaining images, however, the optical character recognition (OCR) methods of the day proved unable to extract the needed information. This strategy was therefore superseded by a Zooniverse citizen-scientist approach. While this resulted in usable astrotags for a selection of sky images, the astrotagging throughput was greatly reduced and the error rate was high. Much has changed in the fields of OCR, image processing, and machine learning image classification methods in the nearly decade since the ADSASS project was launched. Modern methods can deliver not only the original ADSASS vision but a much broader array of results as well. Our preliminary work in this field, detailed in this proposal, shows that we can build image and text classification models from ADS scanned pages. We will provide several levels of data products on our path to classify article figures and astrotag sky images. At the low-level, we will provide OCR'd pages of scanned articles, providing words and their location on the page and page layout analysis giving the locations of elements such as figures, captions, axis labels and titles. At the mid-level we will provide classifications of scanned figures into various categories: images of the sky, photographs, etc. The high-level, science-ready data products will consist of a database of sky images tagged with validated coordinate and provenance information such that they are ready for immediate use by researchers in the same fashion as any other image off the telescope. All data products and the software used to derive them will be open source and available to the community. While valuable as a tool for data discovery and observation-planning, automated astrotagging is but one way our data products can be used to extract scientific meaning from the ADS corpus. The wealth of science generated by such indexing efforts in other STEM fields (mathematics, biology) has demonstrated that we have only scratched the surface of the discoveries possible when the community has access to science-ready data collected from the literature., Mass and energy injection throughout the lifetime of a star cluster contributes to the gas reservoir available for subsequent episodes of star formation and the feedback energy budget responsible for ejecting material from the cluster. In addition, mass processed in stellar interiors and ejected as winds has the potential to augment the abundance ratios of currently forming stars, or stars which form at a later time from a retained gas reservoir. Here, we present hydrodynamical simulations that explore a wide range of cluster masses, compactnesses, metallicities, and stellar population age combinations in order to determine the range of parameter space conducive to stellar wind retention or wind powered gas expulsion in star clusters. We discuss the effects of the stellar wind prescription on retention and expulsion effectiveness, using MESA stellar evolutionary models as a test bed for exploring how the amounts of wind retention/expulsion depend upon the amount of mixing between the winds from stars of different masses and ages. We conclude by summarizing some implications for gas retention and expulsion in a variety of compact (σ<SUB>v</SUB> ≳ 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) star clusters including young massive star clusters (10<SUP>5</SUP> ≲ M/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>7</SUP>, age ≲ 500 Myr), intermediate age clusters (10<SUP>5</SUP> ≲ M/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>7</SUP>, age ≈ 1-4 Gyr), and globular clusters (10<SUP>5</SUP> ≲ M/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>7</SUP>, age ≳ 10 Gyr)., The distribution of elements in galaxies provides a wealth of information about their production sites and their subsequent mixing into the interstellar medium. Here we investigate the elemental distributions of stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) ∼ 9.7-11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star-neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2-4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust., The talk gives an overview of recent state-of-the-art simulations aimed at probing chemical evolution in the larger context of cosmological galaxy formation. The focus of the talk is on new features of the IllustrisTNG models - a set of gravitational, hydrodynamical, MHD cosmological simulations aimed at resolving from the formation of galaxy clusters down to the structures of Milky Way dwarf galaxies. I will conclude with some preliminary results on the distribution of elements in these simulations, including alpha and r-process elements, and discuss ongoing efforts to robustly compare observational and simulated data., The rapid growth in scale and complexity of both computational and observational astrophysics over the past decade necessitates efficient and intuitive methods for examining and visualizing large data sets. Here, we discuss some newly developed tools used to import and manipulate astrophysical data into the three-dimensional visual effects software, Houdini. This software is widely used by visual effects artists, but a recently implemented Python API now allows astronomers to more easily use Houdini as a visualization tool. This paper includes a description of features, workflow, and various example visualizations. The project website, <A href=""http://www.ytini.com"">www.ytini.com</A>, is aimed at a scientific audience and contains Houdini tutorials and links to the Python script Bitbucket repository to simplify the process of importing and rendering astrophysical data., The rapid growth in scale and complexity of both computational and observational astrophysics over the past decade necessitates efficient and intuitive methods for examining and visualizing large datasets. Here, I present AstroBlend, an open-source Python library for use within the three dimensional modeling software, Blender. While Blender has been a popular open-source software among animators and visual effects artists, in recent years it has also become a tool for visualizing astrophysical datasets. AstroBlend combines the three dimensional capabilities of Blender with the analysis tools of the widely used astrophysical toolset, yt, to afford both computational and observational astrophysicists the ability to simultaneously analyze their data and create informative and appealing visualizations. The introduction of this package includes a description of features, work flow, and various example visualizations. A website - www.astroblend.com - has been developed which includes tutorials, and a gallery of example images and movies, along with links to downloadable data, three dimensional artistic models, and various other resources., AstroBlend is a visualization package for use in the three dimensional animation and modeling software, Blender. It reads data in via a text file or can use pre-fab isosurface files stored as OBJ or Wavefront files. AstroBlend supports a variety of codes such as FLASH (ascl:1010.082), Enzo (ascl:1010.072), and Athena (ascl:1010.014), and combines artistic 3D models with computational astrophysics datasets to create models and animations., During galaxy mergers the gas falls to the center, triggers star formation, and feeds the rapid growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). SMBHs respond to this fueling by supplying energy back to the ambient gas. Numerical studies suggest that this feedback is necessary to explain why the properties of SMBHs and the formation of bulges are closely related. This intimate link between the SMBH’s mass and the large scale dynamics and luminosity of the host has proven to be a difficult issue to tackle with simulations due to the inability to resolve all the relevant length scales simultaneously. In this paper we simulate SMBH growth at high-resolution with FLASH, accounting for the gravitational focusing effects of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which appear to be ubiquitous in galactic nuclei. In the simulations, the NSC core is resolved by a minimum cell size of about 0.001 pc or approximately 10<SUP>-3</SUP> of the cluster’s radius. We discuss the conditions required for effective gas funneling to occur, which are mainly dominated by a relationship between NSC velocity dispersion and the local sound speed, and provide a sub-grid prescription for the augmentation of central SMBH accretion rates in the presence of NSCs. For the conditions expected to persist in the centers of merging galaxies, the resultant large central gas densities in NSCs should produce drastically enhanced embedded SMBH accretion rates—up to an order of magnitude increase can be achieved for gas properties resembling those in large-scale galaxy merger simulations. This will naturally result in faster black hole growth rates and higher luminosities than predicted by the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion formalism., Star formation cannot proceed without the existence of an extensive gas reservoir. In particular, the supply of gas to form stars in dwarf galaxies and star clusters requires overcoming a variety of difficulties - namely, the effectiveness of different feedback mechanisms in removing gas from these shallow gravitational potentials. In addition, the supply of external gas to these systems is determined by the large scale galactic structure in which they reside. This thesis employs computational hydrodynamics coupled with physically realistic subgrid feedback prescriptions to resolve the interplay between the small scale feedback mechanisms and larger scale gas flows to determine the amount of gas a shallow potential can accumulate. First, we consider the flow of gas external to dwarf galaxies and star clusters into their cores as a generalized accretion process. Second, we explore the enhancement of gas accretion rates onto the compact members of young star clusters when the flow of external gas into the cluster cores is large. Third, we discuss how external gas flows initiated by the presence of a massive nuclear star cluster can enhance central massive black hole accretion rates during galaxy mergers. Fourth, we change our focus to exploring internal stellar wind retention in proto-globular clusters as a mechanism to supply gas for multiple episodes of star formation. Finally, the implications of stellar wind retention on the current gas reservoir in globular clusters is discussed., Accretion studies have been focused on the flow around bodies with point mass gravitational potentials, but few general results are available for non-point mass distributions. Here, we study the accretion flow onto non-divergent, core potentials moving through a background medium. We use Plummer and Hernquist potentials as examples to study gas accretion onto star clusters, dwarf and large galaxy halos, and galaxy clusters in a variety of astrophysical environments. The general conditions required for a core potential to collectively accrete large quantities of gas from the external medium are derived using both simulations and analytic results. The consequences of large mass accumulation in galaxy nuclei, dwarf galaxies, and star clusters are twofold. First, if the gas cools effectively star formation can be triggered, generating new stellar members in the system. Second, if the collective potential of the system is able to alter the ambient gas properties before the gas is accreted onto the individual core members, the augmented mass supply rates could significantly alter the state of the various accreting stellar populations and result in an enhanced central black hole accretion luminosity., Here, we show that the overabundance of ultraluminous, compact X-ray sources associated with moderately young clusters in interacting galaxies such as the Antennae and the Cartwheel can be given an alternative explanation that does not involve the presence of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). We argue that gas density within these systems is enhanced by the collective potential of the cluster prior to being accreted onto the individual cluster members and, as a result, the aggregate X-ray luminosity arising from the neutron star cluster members can exceed &gt; 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Various observational tests to distinguish between IMBHs and accreting neutron star cusps are discussed., We use the RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) to study solar flare gamma rays that are signatures of the accelerated ions. Specifically, we analyze the prominent 2.2 MeV line due to neutron capture whose time profile depends on the ambient 3He/H ratio, accelerated ion spectral index and incident ion angular distribution. For the first time we fit the 2.2 MeV time profile and overall normalization jointly with a full spectral fit to find a minimum in the total chi-square. This allows for self-consistent constraints on many of the flaring environment parameters, including the energetic particle spectral index, degree of pitch angle scattering, ambient abundances including 3He, accelerated abundances, magnetic field convergence, and the effective angle of the flare. The temporal model consists of a kernel (the response to a delta-function particle injection) convolved with the observed 4-7MeV flux, dominated by prompt nuclear emission. The spectral fitting includes a recently improved model of the nuclear de- excitation continuum. By comparing fits of multiple flares we provide stronger constrains on the flare environment parameters as well as best current constraint to the 3He/H abundance in the sun., We use the RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) to study solar flare gamma rays that are signatures of the accelerated ions.

A peculiar galaxy at a distance of 13 Mpc, NGC 660 contains concentrated central star formation of power ∼ 2 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> L<SUB>sun</SUB>. Our 1.3 cm continuum image reveals a bright, compact source of less than 10 pc extent with a rising spectral index. We infer that this is optically thick free-free emission from a super star cluster nebula. The nebula is less than 10 pc in size, comparable in luminosity to the ``supernebula"" in the dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253. We estimate that there are a few thousand O stars contained in this single young cluster. There are a number of other weaker continuum sources, either slightly smaller or more evolved clusters of similar size within the central 300 parsecs of the galaxy. <P />This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation.","['2023arXiv230911549N', 'arXiv:2309.11549', '10.48550/arXiv.2309.11549', '2023arXiv230211583N', 'arXiv:2302.11583', '10.48550/arXiv.2302.11583', '10.48550/arXiv.2209.04460', '2022arXiv220904460N', 'arXiv:2209.04460', '2019MNRAS.tmp.3045N', '2013arXiv1310.8301N', 'arXiv:1310.8301', '2020MNRAS.491.4602N', '10.48550/arXiv.1310.8301', '10.1093/mnras/stz3353', '2020adap.prop..225N', '10.48550/arXiv.1206.5002', '2018MNRAS.478.2794N', '10.1093/mnras/sty1198', '2018MNRAS.tmp.1141N', '2012arXiv1206.5002N', 'arXiv:1206.5002', 'arXiv:1707.03401', '10.1093/mnras/sty618', '10.48550/arXiv.1707.03401', '2018MNRAS.477.1206N', '2017arXiv170703401N', '2018MNRAS.tmp..585N', '2018APS..APRC07003N', '10.48550/arXiv.1701.01730', '2017PASP..129e8008N', '10.1088/1538-3873/aa51b3', 'arXiv:1701.01730', '2017arXiv170101730N', '2016A&C....15...50N', '10.1016/j.ascom.2016.02.002', 'arXiv:1602.03178', '2016arXiv160203178N', '10.48550/arXiv.1602.03178', '2015ascl.soft12007N', 'ascl:1512.007', '2014arXiv1410.7381N', '2015ApJ...803...81N', '10.48550/arXiv.1410.7381', 'arXiv:1410.7381', '10.1088/0004-637X/803/2/81', '2014PhDT........34N', '2011ApJ...735...25N', '10.1088/0004-637X/735/1/25', '10.48550/arXiv.1104.3140', '2011arXiv1104.3140N', 'arXiv:1104.3140', 'arXiv:0910.1592', '10.48550/arXiv.0910.1592', '2009arXiv0910.1592N', '10.1088/0004-637X/705/2/L153', '2009ApJ...705L.153N', '2008AGUFMSH31B1670N', '2007AGUFMSH41A0307N', '2004BAAS...36.1387N', '2004AAS...205.2607N']","[('gas', 34), ('cluster', 33), ('star', 30), ('galaxy', 22), ('data', 21), ('ocr', 14), ('stellar', 14), ('model', 13), ('image', 13), ('figure', 12)]","[(('star', 'cluster'), 13), (('globular', 'cluster'), 7), (('figure', 'caption'), 6), (('star', 'formation'), 6), (('scanned', 'page'), 5), (('data', 'product'), 5), (('dwarf', 'galaxy'), 5), (('black', 'hole'), 5), (('spectral', 'index'), 5), (('optical', 'character'), 4)]","[(('optical', 'character', 'recognition'), 4), (('character', 'recognition', 'ocr'), 4), (('astrophysics', 'data', 'system'), 4), (('data', 'system', 'ads'), 4), (('scientific', 'articles', 'published'), 3), (('articles', 'published', 'prior'), 3), (('published', 'prior', 'age'), 3), (('prior', 'age', 'digitization'), 3), (('astrophysics', 'literature', 'holdings'), 3), (('nasa', 'astrophysics', 'data'), 3)]",Dirty

We considered what types of observations outside the core surveys would most benefit from early definition, given 700 hours of mission time in the first two years of Roman's operation. We recommend that a survey of the Galactic plane be defined early, based on the broad range of stakeholders for such a survey, the added scientific value of a first pass to obtain a baseline for proper motions complementary to Gaia's, and the significant potential synergies with ground-based surveys, notably the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on Rubin. We also found strong motivation to follow a community definition process for ultra-deep observations with Roman., Turning Roman's eye on the Galactic plane would generate an enormous and potentially revolutionary new dataset with broad utility across many fields. Synthetic surveys, designed to mimic what Roman will see based on state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy formation, can forecast results, train and validate new analysis methods, and constrain the physical models in simulations. I will describe how such surveys are constructed, discuss some lessons learned from modeling the Gaia astrometric survey, and preview what we might expect from a Roman Galactic Plane Survey., With Gaia Data Release 2, the astronomical community is entering a new era of multidimensional surveys of the Milky Way. This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations to simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We use three cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of mass 7070 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at z = 0 for each simulated galaxy. We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data., In the next decade our understanding of the Milky Way's dynamics, stellar populations, and structure will be revolutionized, thanks to proposed astrometric, spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We describe the new science this multidimensional view will enable across astrophysics, from constraints on dark matter to insights into galaxy formation., , The wealth of ongoing and upcoming observations of the Milky Way (MW) promise an era of ""near-field cosmology"" that can test the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. One of the most exciting and powerful probes of DM is using the MW's stellar streams as ""gravitational antennae:"" close passages of small DM substructures dynamically perturb cold stellar streams, allowing us to test the diverging predictions of different DM models for the low-mass end of the (sub)halo mass function. Recent measurements of MW stellar streams offer exciting hints of evidence for DM subhalo perturbations, but a critical challenge in modeling and interpreting such subhalo-stream interactions remains: the lack of sufficiently realistic theoretical tools to make robust observational predictions in realistic MW-like environments. We propose to model the dynamics of DM subhalo interactions with stellar streams from disrupted globular clusters and satellite galaxies in realistic detail, by implementing new numerical methods to inject stellar streams into existing cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of MW-like galaxies, and creating synthetic observations of these simulated perturbed streams. These simulations will allow us to analyze, for the first time, the gravitational and hydrodynamical effects of a live MW-like galaxy on the survivability of nearby DM subhalos, as well as baryonic sources of perturbations on stellar streams (such as giant molecular clouds) that can mimic those ascribed to DM substructure. Using these new tools, we will make detailed predictions for the observable dynamical effects of DM subhalo interactions on stellar streams. Furthermore, we will resimulate several of our MW systems using alternative (warm or self-interacting) DM models to generate falsifiable observational tests of the nature of DM via the analysis of stellar streams. The proposed work will result in the first comprehensive, end-to-end study that connects cosmological predictions from hydrodynamic simulations to interpretations of, and predictions for, observable perturbations from DM subhalos on stellar streams. New numerical tools developed for this proposal will allow us to predict the degree to which observations of stream perturbations uniquely constrain the properties of the DM subhalo perturbers, and how observable stream properties differ in alternative DM models. We will make our synthetic observations of streams, subhalo catalogs, and full simulation snapshot data publicly available, in user-friendly databases, providing much-needed theoretical tools to the community for exploring and testing subhalo-stream dynamics at this critical time for MW observations., We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE project to evaluate various strategies for estimating the mass of a galaxy’s stellar halo from deep, integrated-light images. We find good agreement with integrated-light observations if we mimic observational methods to measure the mass of the stellar halo by selecting regions of an image via projected radius relative to the disk scale length or by their surface density in stellar mass. However, these observational methods systematically underestimate the accreted stellar component, defined in our (and most) simulations as the mass of stars formed outside of the host galaxy, by up to a factor of 10, since the accreted component is centrally concentrated and therefore substantially obscured by the galactic disk. Furthermore, these observational methods introduce spurious dependencies of the estimated accreted stellar component on the stellar mass and size of galaxies that can obscure the trends in accreted stellar mass predicted by cosmological simulations, since we find that in our simulations, the size and shape of the central galaxy are not strongly correlated with the assembly history of the accreted stellar halo. This effect persists whether galaxies are viewed edge-on or face-on. We show that metallicity or color information may provide a way to more cleanly delineate in observations the regions dominated by accreted stars. Absent additional data, we caution that estimates of the mass of the accreted stellar component from single-band images alone should be taken as lower limits., The Wide-Field InfraRed Space Telescope (WFIRST) will be capable of delivering precise astrometry for faint sources over the enormous field of view of its main camera, the Wide-Field Imager (WFI). This unprecedented combination will be transformative for the many scientific questions that require precise positions, distances, and velocities of stars. I will describe the expectations for the astrometric precision of the WFIRST WFI in different scenarios, illustrate how a broad range of science cases will see significant advances with such data, and outline synergies with current and future projects such as Gaia and LSST., A new generation of observational projects is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the resolved stellar populations of Milky-Way-like galaxies at an unprecedented level of detail, ushering in an era of precision studies of galaxy formation. In the Milky Way itself, astrometric, spectroscopic and photometric surveys will measure three-dimensional positions and velocities and numerous chemical abundances for stars from the disk to the halo, as well as for many satellite dwarf galaxies. In the Local Group and beyond, HST, JWST and eventually WFIRST will deliver pristine views of resolved stars. The groundbreaking scale and dimensionality of this new view of resolved stellar populations in galaxies challenge us to develop new theoretical tools to robustly compare these surveys to simulated galaxies, in order to take full advantage of our new ability to make detailed predictions for stellar populations within a cosmological context. I will describe a framework for generating realistic synthetic star catalogs and mock surveys from state-of-the-art cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations, and present several early scientific results from, and predictions for, resolved stellar surveys of our Galaxy and its neighbors., Currently, only a small number of Milky Way (MW) stars are known to exist beyond 100 kpc from the Galactic Centre. Though the distribution of these stars in the outer halo is believed to be sparse, they can provide evidence of more recent accretion events than in the inner halo and help map out the MW's dark matter halo to its virial radius. We have re-examined the outermost regions of 11 existing stellar halo models with two synthetic surveys: one mimicking present-day searches for distant M giants and another mimicking RR Lyra (RRL) projections for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our models suggest that colour and proper motion cuts currently used to select M giant candidates for follow-up successfully remove nearly all self-contamination from foreground halo dwarf stars and are useful for focusing observations on distant M giants, of which there are thousands to tens of thousands beyond 100 kpc in our models. We likewise expect that LSST will identify comparable numbers of RRLe at these distances. We demonstrate that several observable properties of both tracers, such as proximity of neighbouring stars, proper motions and distances (for RRLe), could help us separate different accreted dwarf galaxies from one another in the distant MW halo. We also discuss prospects for using ratios of M giants to RRLe as a proxy for accretion time, which in the future could provide new constraints on the recent accretion history of our Galaxy., With the upcoming release of the Gaia catalog and the many multiplexed spectroscopic surveys on the horizon, we are rapidly moving into a new data-driven era in the study of the Milky Way's stellar halo. When combined, these data sets will give us a many-dimensional view of stars in accreted structures in the halo that includes both dynamical information about their orbits and chemical information about their formation histories. Using simulated data from the state-of-the-art Latte simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxies, which include hydrodynamics, feedback, and chemical evolution in a cosmological setting, we demonstrate that while dynamical information alone can be used to constrain models of the Galactic mass distribution in the halo, including the extra dimensions provided by chemical abundances can improve these constraints as well as assist in untangling different accreted components., Stellar streams result from the tidal disruption of satellites and star clusters as they orbit a host galaxy, and can be very sensitive probes of the gravitational potential of the host system. We select and study narrow stellar streams formed in a Milky-Way-like dark matter halo of the Aquarius suite of cosmological simulations, to determine if these streams can be used to constrain the present day characteristic parameters of the halo’s gravitational potential. We find that orbits integrated in both spherical and triaxial static Navarro-Frenk-White potentials reproduce the locations and kinematics of the various streams reasonably well. To quantify this further, we determine the best-fit potential parameters by maximizing the amount of clustering of the stream stars in the space of their actions. We show that using our set of Aquarius streams, we recover a mass profile that is consistent with the spherically averaged dark matter profile of the host halo, although we ignored both triaxiality and time evolution in the fit. This gives us confidence that such methods can be applied to the many streams that will be discovered by the Gaia mission to determine the gravitational potential of our Galaxy., With the upcoming release of the Gaia catalog and the many multiplexed spectroscopic surveys on the horizon, we are rapidly moving into a new data-driven era in the study of the Milky Way's stellar halo. When combined, these data sets will give us a many-dimensional view of stars in accreted structures in the halo that includes both dynamical information about their orbits and chemical information about their formation histories. Using simulated data from the state-of-the-art Latte simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxies, which include hydrodynamics, feedback, and chemical evolution in a cosmological setting using the FIRE physics model, we demonstrate that while dynamical information alone can be used to constrain models of the Galactic mass distribution in the halo, including the extra dimensions provided by chemical abundances can improve these constraints as well as assist in untangling different accreted components., We perform the first self-consistent measurement of the rate of interactions between stellar tidal streams created by disrupting satellites and dark subhalos in a cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-mass galaxy. Using a retagged version of the Aquarius A dark-matter-only simulation, we selected 18 streams of tagged star particles that appear thin at the present day and followed them from the point their progenitors accrete onto the main halo, recording in each snapshot the characteristics of all dark-matter subhalos passing within several distance thresholds of any tagged star particle in each stream. We considered distance thresholds corresponding to constant impact parameters (1, 2, and 5 kpc), as well as those proportional to the region of influence of each subhalo (one and two times its half-mass radius $r_{1/2}$). We then measured the age and present-day, phase-unwrapped length of each stream in order to compute the interaction rate in different mass bins and for different thresholds, and compared these to analytic predictions from the literature. We measure a median rate of $1.5^{+3.0}_{-1.1}\ (9.1^{+17.5}_{-7.1},\ 61.8^{+211}_{-40.6})$ interactions within 1 (2, 5) kpc of the stream per 10 kpc of stream length per 10 Gyr. Resolution effects (both time and particle number) affect these estimated rates by lowering them., In the coming decade, the Gaia satellite will precisely measure the positions and velocities of millions of stars in the Galactic halo, including stars in many tidal streams. These streams, the products of hierarchical accretion of satellite galaxies by the Milky Way (MW), can be used to infer the Galactic gravitational potential thanks to their initial compactness in phase space. Plans for observations to extend Gaia’s radial velocity (RV) measurements to faint stars, and to determine precise distances to RR Lyrae in streams, would further extend the power of Gaia’s kinematic catalog to characterize the MW’s potential at large Galactocentric distances. In this work I explore the impact of these extra data on the ability to fit the potential using the method of action clustering, which statistically maximizes the information content (clumpiness) of the action space of tidal streams, eliminating the need to determine stream membership for individual stars. Using a mock halo in a toy spherical potential, updated post-launch error models for Gaia, and estimates for RV and distance errors for the tracers to be followed up, I show that combining either form of additional information with the Gaia catalog greatly reduces the bias in determining the scale radius and total mass of the Galaxy compared to the use of Gaia data alone., We present a new method for constraining the Milky Way halo gravitational potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. This method requires three-dimensional positions and velocities for all stars to be fit, but does not require identification of any specific stream or determination of stream membership for any star. We exploit the principle that the action distribution of stream stars is most clustered when the potential used to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. Clustering is quantified with the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), which also provides conditional uncertainties for our parameter estimates. We show, for toy Gaia-like data in a spherical isochrone potential, that maximizing the KLD of the action distribution relative to a smoother distribution recovers the input potential. The precision depends on the observational errors and number of streams; using K III giants as tracers, we measure the enclosed mass at the average radius of the sample stars accurate to 3% and precise to 20%-40%. Recovery of the scale radius is precise to 25%, biased 50% high by the small galactocentric distance range of stars in our mock sample (1-25 kpc, or about three scale radii, with mean 6.5 kpc). 20-25 streams with at least 100 stars each are required for a stable confidence interval. With radial velocities (RVs) to 100 kpc, all parameters are determined with ~10% accuracy and 20% precision (1.3% accuracy for the enclosed mass), underlining the need to complete the RV catalog for faint halo stars observed by Gaia., In the coming decade the Gaia satellite will measure the positions and velocities of an unprecedented number of stars in our Galaxy, with unprecedented precision. Among many firsts, this revolutionary new data set will include full six-dimensional phase space information for millions of stars in the Galactic halo, including stars in many tidal streams. These streams, the products of hierarchical accretion, can be used to infer the Galactic gravitational potential thanks to the common origin of the stars in each one. We present a method for doing so by maximizing the information content (i.e. clumpiness) of the action space of the stream stars. This statistical approach eliminates the need to assign stars to particular streams. Using a toy model of the stellar halo in a known potential, and including updated error models for Gaia, we show that ground-based spectroscopic follow-up of faint halo stars is essential to complete the six-dimensional Gaia catalog and properly constrain the scale radius of the potential. By fitting a spherical NFW potential to streams in a cosmologically simulated halo, we show how oversimplification of the potential model affects fit results. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. AST-1400989., Given a parametrized model of the Galactic potential, the best-fit parameters can be obtained by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the action distribution of a set of stars initially clustered in action space (e.g. stars in tidal streams). This method will allow us to map the Milky Way's gravitational potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams without requiring stream membership information. With 20 streams of at least 20 stars each, including observational errors consistent with predictions for Gaia, this technique recovers the input potential parameters to a precision of 10-60% and an accuracy of 10%. With all the observed streams in our mock stellar halo (about 40) that fit the error criteria, the precision improves to 10%., We present a new method for constraining the Milky Way's gravitational potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. This method requires full six-dimensional phase-space information for all stars in the streams, which will be provided by Gaia, but it does not require specific identification of any stream in the data, nor determination of stream membership for any star, nor any physical model of stream formation or morphology. The method works on the principle that the action distribution of stars is most clustered (most informative or least entropic) when the potential used to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. To measure the amount of clustering we use the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) or cross-entropy or relative entropy, a measure of information. The KLD has an interpretation as a relative likelihood, so the method can make use of the machinery of probabilistic inference, including especially providing justified uncertainties on parameter estimates. We show for toy Gaia-like data (in a spherical isochrone potential) that maximization of the KLD of the action-space distribution of stars relative to a smoother distribution (product of marginals) can be used to estimate accurately the true values of the potential parameters, with a precision depending on the observational errors and the number and type of streams in the sample., The class of tidal features around galaxies known as `shells' or `umbrellas' comprises debris that has arisen from high-mass-ratio mergers with low-impact parameter; the nearly radial orbits of the debris give rise to a unique morphology, a universal density profile and a tight correlation between positions and velocities of the material. As such they are accessible to analytical treatment, and can provide a relatively clean system for probing the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. In this work, we present a simple analytical model that describes the density profile, phase-space distribution, and geometry of a shell and whose parameters are directly related to physical characteristics of the interacting galaxies. The model makes three assumptions: the orbit of the interacting galaxies is radial, the potential of the host galaxy at the shell radius is spherical and the satellite galaxy's initial velocity distribution is Maxwellian. We quantify the error introduced by the first two assumptions and show that selecting shells by their appearance on the sky is a sufficient basis to assume that these simplifications are valid. We further demonstrate that (1) given only an image of a shell, the radial gravitational force at the shell edge and the phase-space density of the satellite are jointly constrained, (2) combining the image with measurements of either point line-of-sight velocities or integrated-light spectra will yield an independent estimate of the gravitational force at a shell and (3) an independent measurement of this force is obtained for each shell observed around a given galaxy, potentially enabling a determination of the galactic mass distribution., Dark matter substructures around nearby galaxies provide an interesting opportunity for confusion-free indirect detection of dark matter. We calculate the boost over a smooth background distribution of dark matter for gamma-ray emission from dark matter self-annihilations in tidal structures in M31, assuming a cross-section inversely proportional to the relative velocities of the dark matter particles as proposed by the Sommerfeld effect. The low velocity of the material in the structure results in a significant increase in gamma-ray emission compared to both the background halo and the predicted emission for a velocity-independent cross-section. We also calculate the expected signal for Fermi, for reasonable choices of the dark matter parameters. We find that for a cross-section proportional to v<SUP>-2</SUP>, the enhancement to the annihilation rate is sufficient to test the velocity dependence of the cross-section by spatial correlation with the stellar component of the M31 Giant Stream, given sufficient detector sensitivity., Recently, large-scale sky surveys and deep follow-up images have discovered a wealth of tidal debris around our Galaxy and others nearby. This debris can give clues to the shapes and masses of the dark matter haloes surrounding these galaxies, as well as those of the dwarf galaxies that were tidally disrupted to form the debris. The class of tidal features known variously as ``shells'' or ``umbrellas"" comprises debris that has arisen from minor (high-mass-ratio) mergers with low orbital angular momentum; the nearly radial orbits of the debris give rise to a unique shape and a universal radial density profile. The profile takes this form because the dynamics of the debris can be described by a modified version of the mathematical theory of caustics. Based on this universality, I present a new method for constraining multiple parameters of a minor merger in an external galaxy using only the two-dimensional image of the debris., Indirect detection of high-energy particles from dark matter interactions is a promising avenue for learning more about dark matter, but is hampered by the frequent coincidence of high-energy astrophysical sources of such particles with putative high-density regions of dark matter. We calculate the boost factor and gamma-ray flux from dark matter associated with two shell-like caustics of luminous tidal debris recently discovered around the Andromeda galaxy, under the assumption that dark matter is its own supersymmetric antiparticle. These shell features could be a good candidate for indirect detection of dark matter via gamma rays because they are located far from the primary confusion sources at the galaxy's center, and because the shapes of the shells indicate that most of the mass has piled up near the apocenter. Using a numerical estimator specifically calibrated to estimate densities in N-body representations with sharp features and a previously determined N-body model of the shells, we find that the largest boost factors do occur in the shells but are only a few percent. We also find that the gamma-ray flux is an order of magnitude too low to be detected with Fermi for likely dark matter parameters, and about two orders of magnitude less than the signal that would have come from the dwarf galaxy that produces the shells in the N-body model. We further show that the radial density profiles and relative radial spacing of the shells, in either dark or luminous matter, is relatively insensitive to the details of the potential of the host galaxy but depends in a predictable way on the velocity dispersion of the progenitor galaxy., Action-angle variables provide an instructive alternative viewpoint for studying the dynamical properties of objects in our Galaxy. Using a numerical method that constructs actions in an axisymmetric potential fit to the rotation curve of the Milky Way, we determine the locations in action space of two samples of stars from the SDSS survey for which complete six-dimensional phase space information is available: a small sample of ultra-cool dwarfs thought to include a large proportion of halo stars, and a large sample of M dwarfs that includes both disk and halo stars. We use this technique to examine the orbits of halo stars, compare the dynamical properties of the Milky Way thin and thick disks, and search for moving groups. We also demonstrate how observational errors and selection functions may be projected into action space, and forecast the performance of our method for next-generation astrometric surveys. ), Action-angle variables provide an instructive alternative viewpoint for studying the dynamical properties of objects in our Galaxy.

I use the approximate-action method pioneered by MacMillan and Binney (2008) to examine the remnant of a late-time merger in M31, which was modeled by Fardal et al. (2007)., Dark matter caustics formed by galaxy mergers can substantially enhance the local density of dark matter, and even more substantially enhance the gamma-ray flux from WIMP annihilations in those caustics, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. This effect raises the possibility that a high-energy gamma ray detector, such as GLAST, may be able to detect annihilation signals from extragalactic caustics. I calculate the annihilation flux for two cases where caustics are already known to exist from stellar morphology and kinematics: the classic shell galaxy NGC3293 and the shell in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) recently discovered by Fardal et al.","['arXiv:2404.14342', '10.48550/arXiv.2404.14342', '2024arXiv240414342S', '2024AAS...24324204S', '2020ApJS..246....6S', '2018arXiv180610564S', '10.3847/1538-4365/ab5b9d', 'arXiv:1806.10564', '10.48550/arXiv.1806.10564', '10.48550/arXiv.1903.07641', '2019arXiv190307641S', '2019BAAS...51c.347S', 'arXiv:1903.07641', '2019astro2020T.347S', '2019ibsd.confE...8S', '2019atp..prop...68S', '2017arXiv171205808S', 'arXiv:1712.05808', '10.3847/1538-4357/aaeb33', '2018ApJ...869...12S', '10.48550/arXiv.1712.05808', '2018cosp...42E2963S', '2018DDA....4930202S', '10.48550/arXiv.1609.06406', '2016arXiv160906406S', 'arXiv:1609.06406', '2017MNRAS.470.5014S', '10.1093/mnras/stx1614', '2017Galax...5...43S', '10.3390/galaxies5030043', '10.48550/arXiv.1609.01653', '2017ApJ...836..234S', 'arXiv:1609.01653', '10.3847/1538-4357/aa5eb4', '2016arXiv160901653S', '2017AAS...22914216S', 'arXiv:1608.05624', '2016arXiv160805624S', '10.48550/arXiv.1608.05624', '10.3847/0004-637X/818/1/41', '2016arXiv160100649S', '10.48550/arXiv.1601.00649', 'arXiv:1601.00649', '2016ApJ...818...41S', '10.48550/arXiv.1404.6534', '10.1088/0004-637X/801/2/98', '2014arXiv1404.6534S', 'arXiv:1404.6534', '2015ApJ...801...98S', '2015AAS...22511902E', '2015AAS...22511902S', '10.1017/S1743921313006388', '2014IAUS..298..207S', '2014AAS...22334610S', '2013MNRAS.435..378S', '2013MNRAS.tmp.2057S', '2012arXiv1211.4522S', '10.48550/arXiv.1211.4522', 'arXiv:1211.4522', '10.1093/mnras/stt1307', '2011arXiv1106.4264S', '2012MNRAS.420.2445S', '10.48550/arXiv.1106.4264', 'arXiv:1106.4264', '10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.20215.x', '2011AAS...21812001S', '2011BAAS..43G12001S', '2010ApJ...725.1652S', '10.1088/0004-637X/725/2/1652', 'arXiv:1006.4165', '2010arXiv1006.4165E', '10.48550/arXiv.1006.4165', '2010APS..APRG13001S', '2010BAAS...42..252S', '2010AAS...21541312S', '2009APS..APR.G8008S', '2008APS..APR.K1011S']","[('galaxy', 56), ('stream', 56), ('star', 53), ('halo', 40), ('stellar', 37), ('potential', 34), ('survey', 31), ('mass', 27), ('dark', 26), ('gaia', 25)]","[(('dark', 'matter'), 24), (('stellar', 'stream'), 11), (('phase', 'space'), 10), (('stellar', 'halo'), 9), (('gravitational', 'potential'), 9), (('action', 'space'), 9), (('tidal', 'stream'), 8), (('halo', 'star'), 8), (('gamma', 'ray'), 7), (('simulation', 'milky'), 6)]","[(('phase', 'space', 'information'), 5), (('dimensional', 'phase', 'space'), 4), (('simulations', 'milky', 'mass'), 3), (('milky', 'mass', 'galaxies'), 3), (('accreted', 'stellar', 'component'), 3), (('galactic', 'mass', 'distribution'), 3), (('stars', 'tidal', 'streams'), 3), (('present', 'method', 'constraining'), 3), (('gravitational', 'potential', 'simultaneously'), 3), (('potential', 'simultaneously', 'fitting'), 3)]",Dirty

We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars - a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature - and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux., , The pathways through which incoming energy is distributed between the surface and atmosphere have been analyzed for the Earth. However, the effect of the spectral energy distribution of a host star on the energy budget of an orbiting planet may be significant given the wavelength-dependent absorption properties of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB>, water vapor, surface ice, and snow. We have quantified the flow of energy on aqua planets orbiting M-, G-, and F-dwarf stars, using a 3D Global Climate Model with a static ocean. The atmosphere and surface of an M-dwarf planet receiving an instellation equal to 88% of the modern solar constant at the top of the atmosphere absorb 12% more incoming stellar radiation than those of a G-dwarf planet receiving 100% of the modern solar constant, and 17% more radiation than an F-dwarf planet receiving 108% of the modern solar constant, resulting in climates similar to that of modern-day Earth on all three planets, assuming a 24 hr rotation period and fixed CO<SUB>2</SUB>. At 100% instellation, a synchronously rotating M-dwarf planet exhibits smaller flux absorption in the atmosphere and on the surface of the dayside, and a dayside mean surface temperature that is 37 K colder than its rapidly rotating counterpart. Energy budget diagrams are included to illustrate the variations in global energy budgets as a function of host star spectral class, and can contribute to habitability assessments of planets as they are discovered., The discovery of planets orbiting stars other than the Sun has accelerated over the past decade, and this trend will continue as new space- and ground-based observatories employ next-generation instrumentation to search the skies for habitable worlds. However, many factors and processes can affect planetary habitability and must be understood to accurately determine a planet’s habitability potential. While climate models have long been used to understand and predict climate and weather patterns on the Earth, a growing community of researchers has begun to apply these models to extrasolar planets. This work has provided a better understanding of how orbital, surface, and atmospheric properties affect planetary climate and habitability; how these climatic effects might change for different stellar and planetary environments; and how the habitability and observational signatures of newly discovered planets might be influenced by these climatic factors. This review summarizes the origins and evolution of the burgeoning field of exoplanet climatology, discusses recent work using a hierarchy of computer models to identify those planets most capable of supporting life, and offers a glimpse into future directions of this quickly evolving subfield of exoplanet science. <P />Based on an invited talk at the 233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society., The discovery of numerous relatively close planets orbiting low-mass stars signals a major planetary population that may be the primary environment explored in the search for life beyond the Solar System. However, many factors and processes can affect planetary climate and habitability, and their effects must be understood to accurately determine a planet's habitability potential. While three-dimensional global climate models have long been used to predict climate and weather patterns on the Earth, a growing community of researchers has begun to apply these models to extrasolar planets. This work has provided a better understanding of how orbital, surface, and atmospheric properties affect planetary climate and habitability, and how these climatic effects might change for different stellar and planetary environments. Professor Shields will describe the methods used by her research group to quantify the effects on planetary climate of a range of factors currently unconstrained by observations. She will share recent results from this work using a hierarchy of computer models, and discuss the implications of these results for planetary habitability and the identification of those planets most capable of supporting life., A possible surface type that may form in the environments of M-dwarf planets is sodium chloride dihydrate, or ""hydrohalite"" (NaCl ● 2H2O), which can precipitate in bare sea ice at low temperatures. Unlike salt-free water ice, hydrohalite is highly reflective in the near-infrared, where M-dwarf stars emit strongly. We carried out the first exploration of the climatic effect of hydrohalite-induced salt-albedo feedback on extrasolar planets, using a three-dimensional global climate model. Under fixed CO2 conditions, rapidly-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets receiving 65% or less of the modern solar constant from their host stars exhibit cooler temperatures when an albedo parameterization for hydrohalite formation is included in climate simulations, compared to simulations without such a parameterization. Differences in global mean surface temperature with and without this parameterization increase as the instellation is lowered, which may increase CO2 build-up requirements for habitable conditions on planets with active carbon cycles. Synchronously-rotating habitable-zone M-dwarf planets appear susceptible to salt-albedo feedback at higher levels of instellation (90% or less of the modern solar constant) than planets with Earth-like rotation periods, due to their cooler minimum day-side temperatures. These instellation levels where hydrohalite seems most relevant correspond to several recently-discovered potentially habitable M-dwarf planets, including Proxima Centauri b, TRAPPIST- 1e, and LHS 1140b, making an albedo parameterization for hydrohalite of immediate importance in future climate simulations., A possible surface type that may form in the environments of M-dwarf planets is sodium chloride dihydrate, or “hydrohalite” (NaCl · 2H<SUB>2</SUB>O), which can precipitate in bare sea ice at low temperatures.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field., As lower-mass stars often host multiple rocky planets, gravitational interactions among planets can have significant effects on climate and habitability over long timescales. Here we explore a specific case, Kepler-62f (Borucki et al., 2013), a potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system with a K2V host star. N-body integrations reveal the stable range of initial eccentricities for Kepler-62f is 0.00 ≤ e ≤ 0.32, absent the effect of additional, undetected planets. We simulate the tidal evolution of Kepler-62f in this range and find that, for certain assumptions, the planet can be locked in a synchronous rotation state. Simulations using the 3-D Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) Generic global climate model (GCM) indicate that the surface habitability of this planet is sensitive to orbital configuration. With 3 bar of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in its atmosphere, we find that Kepler-62f would only be warm enough for surface liquid water at the upper limit of this eccentricity range, providing it has a high planetary obliquity (between 60° and 90°). A climate similar to that of modern-day Earth is possible for the entire range of stable eccentricities if atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> is increased to 5 bar levels. In a low-CO<SUB>2</SUB> case (Earth-like levels), simulations with version 4 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) GCM and LMD Generic GCM indicate that increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near pericenter permit regions of the planet with above-freezing surface temperatures. This may melt ice sheets formed during colder seasons. If Kepler-62f is synchronously rotating and has an ocean, CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels above 3 bar would be required to distribute enough heat to the nightside of the planet to avoid atmospheric freeze-out and permit a large enough region of open water at the planet's substellar point to remain stable. Overall, we find multiple plausible combinations of orbital and atmospheric properties that permit surface liquid water on Kepler-62f., As lower-mass stars often host multiple rocky planets, gravitational interactions among planets can have significant effects on climate and habitability over long timescales. Here we explore a specific case, Kepler-62f (Borucki et al., 2013), a potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system with a K2V host star.

Simulations using the three-dimensional (3-D) ""Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique"" (LMD) Generic global climate model (GCM) indicate that the surface habitability of this planet is sensitive to orbital configuration. With 3 bars of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in its atmosphere, we find that Kepler-62f would only be warm enough for surface liquid water at the upper limit of this eccentricity range, providing it has a high planetary obliquity (between 60<SUP>°</SUP> and 90<SUP>°</SUP>). A climate similar to modern-day Earth is possible for the entire range of stable eccentricities if atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> is increased to 5-bar levels. In a low-CO<SUB>2</SUB> case (Earth-like levels), simulations with version 4 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) GCM indicate that increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near pericenter permit regions of the planet with above-freezing surface temperatures.

Overall, we find multiple plausible combinations of orbital and atmospheric properties that permit surface liquid water on Kepler-62f., In this work I explored the effect on planetary climate and habitability of interactions between a host star, an orbiting planet and additional planets in a stellar system. I developed and tested models that include both radiative and gravitational effects, and simulated planets covered by ocean, land and water ice, with incident stellar radiation from stars of different spectral types. These simulations showed that ice-covered conditions occurred on an F-dwarf planet with a much smaller decrease in stellar flux than planets orbiting stars with less near-UV radiation, due to ice reflecting strongly in the visible and near-UV. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect is less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where ∼3-10 bars of CO<SUB>2</SUB> could entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the traditional outer limit of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. The exit out of global ice cover was also sensitive to host star spectral energy distribution. A planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibited a smaller resistance to melting out of a frozen state, requiring a smaller stellar flux to initiate deglaciation than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. Given their greater climate stability, planets orbiting cooler, lower-mass stars may be the best candidates for long-term habitability and life beyond the Solar System. A specific case was explored—that of Kepler-62f, a potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system orbiting a K-dwarf star. Simulations using a 3-D Global Climate Model indicated that Kepler-62f would have areas of the planet with surface temperatures above the freezing point of water with 1 bar or more of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in its atmosphere. In a low-CO<SUB>2</SUB> case, increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near pericenter generated regions of the planet with above-freezing surface temperatures, which may cause surface melting of an ice sheet formed during an annual cycle. The methods presented here can be used to assess the possible climates of newly discovered potentially habitable planets in systems with a wide range of orbital architectures., Distant planets in globally ice-covered, ""snowball,"" states may depend on increases in their host stars' luminosity to become hospitable for surface life. Using a general circulation model, we simulated the equilibrium climate response of a planet to a range of instellations from an F-, G-, or M-dwarf star. The range of instellation that permits both complete ice cover and at least partially ice-free climate states is a measure of the climate hysteresis that a planet can exhibit. An ice-covered planet with high climate hysteresis would show a higher resistance to the initial loss of surface ice coverage with increases in instellation, and abrupt, extreme ice loss once deglaciation begins. Our simulations indicate that the climate hysteresis depends sensitively on the host star spectral energy distribution. Under fixed CO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions, a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibits a smaller climate hysteresis, requiring smaller instellation to initiate deglaciation than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. This is due to the higher absorption of near-infrared radiation by ice on the surfaces and greenhouse gases and clouds in the atmosphere of an M-dwarf planet. Increases in atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> further lower the climate hysteresis, as M-dwarf snowball planets exhibit a larger radiative response than G-dwarf snowball planets for the same increase in CO<SUB>2</SUB>. For a smaller hysteresis, planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone will thaw earlier in their evolutionary history, and will experience a less abrupt transition out of global ice cover., The goal of the work presented here is to explore the unique interactions between a host star, an orbiting planet, and additional planets in a stellar system, and to develop and test methods that include both radiative and gravitational effects on planetary climate and habitability. These methods can then be used to identify and assess the possible climates of potentially habitable planets in observed planetary systems. In this work I explored key star-planet interactions using a hierarchy of models, which I modifed to incorporate the spectrum of stars of different spectral types. Using a 1-D energy-balance climate model, a 1-D line-by-line, radiative-transfer model, and a 3-D general circulation model, I simulated planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. I find that terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. Ice extent is much greater on a planet orbiting an F-dwarf star than on a planet orbiting a G-dwarf star at an equivalent flux distance, and ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2% reduction in instellation (incident stellar radiation) relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO<SUB>2</SUB> (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73% of the modern solar constant. The reduction in instellation must be larger for planets orbiting cooler stars due in large part to the stronger absorption of longer-wavelength radiation by icy surfaces on these planets, in addition to stronger absorption by water vapor, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and clouds in their atmospheres, providing increased downwelling longwave radiation. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> can be expected to be high. I show that ∼3-10 bars of CO<SUB>2</SUB> will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the traditional outer limit of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. Simulations of the equilibrium climate response of a planet to increasing instellation from an F-, G-, or M-dwarf star indicate that the exit out of global ice cover is also sensitive to host star spectral energy distribution. Under fixed CO<SUB>2</SUB> conditions, a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibits a smaller resistance to melting out of a frozen state, requiring a smaller instellation to initiate deglaciation than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. This is due to the combined effects of surface ice and snow absorption of the large fraction of near-IR radiation emitted by M-dwarfs, and atmospheric near-IR absorption, which weakens the Hadley circulation, reducing the climate hysteresis (the range over which multiple stable equilibia are possible) of M-dwarf planets. Given their greater climatic stability, planets orbiting cooler, lower-mass stars may be the best candidates for long-term habitability and life beyond the Solar System. As lower-mass stars are likely candidates to host multiple rocky planets, it is important to consider whether gravitational interactions among planets may have significant effects on climate and habitability over long timescales. Using an &lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt;-body integrator with inputs from a method I developed to determine the locations of all planets in a given system at the same epoch using transit timing data, a specific case is explored - that of Kepler-62f (Borucki et al. 2013), a potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system orbiting a K-dwarf star. The maximum stable initial eccentricity possible for Kepler-62f is identified as e = 0.32. Simulations using a 3-D GCM indicate that Kepler-62f would have areas of the planet with surface temperatures above the freezing point of water with 1 bar or more of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in its atmosphere. If it has an active carbon cycle, Kepler-62f could have ample amounts of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere to maintain atmospheric stability and habitable surface conditions while staying well below the maximum CO<SUB>2</SUB> greenhouse limit. In a low-CO<SUB>2</SUB> case (Earth-like levels), increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near pericenter generate regions of the planet with above-freezing surface temperatures, which may cause surface melting of an ice sheet formed during an annual cycle. If Kepler-62f is synchronously rotating and has an ocean, significant cloud cover could develop at the substellar point, increasing planetary albedo and reducing surface temperatures. The methods presented here serve as tested tools that can be used to assess the possible climates of potentially habitable planets in systems with a wide range of orbital architectures as they are discovered., Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. We have explored this effect with a hierarchy of models. Results from both one-dimensional (1-D) radiative transfer and energy balance models and a three-dimensional (3-D) general circulation model indicate that terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We found that ice extent is much greater on a planet orbiting an F-dwarf star than on a planet orbiting a G- or M-dwarf star at an equivalent flux distance, assuming fixed CO<SUP>2</SUP> (present atmospheric level on Earth). The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone for main-sequence stars, where the maintenance of surface liquid water requires high atmospheric CO<SUP>2</SUP> concentrations. We show that ∼3-10 bar of CO<SUP>2</SUP> will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO<SUP>2</SUP> is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars. Both entrance into and exit out of a snowball state are sensitive to host star spectral energy distribution. Our simulations indicate a smaller climate hysteresis on M-dwarf planets, as measured by the range of instellation that permits multiple stable ice line latitudes. While M-dwarf planets appear less susceptible to snowball episodes than G- or F-dwarf planets over the course of their evolution, any snowball planets that are found orbiting M-dwarf stars may more easily melt out of these states as stellar luminosity increases over time. This effect is due to the lower-albedo ice on M-dwarf planets which, compounded with near-IR absorption by atmospheric gases, reduces the amount of increased stellar insolation, or “instellation”, necessary to melt these planets out of a snowball state., Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. Here we explore this effect using a one dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. A three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2% reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8% reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19% reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73% of the modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at the outer edge of the habitable zone, where atmospheric CO2 can be expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid water. We show that 3-10 bars of CO2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars., Planetary climate can be affected by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. A one dimensional (1-D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model is used to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1-D energy-balance climate model. We simulated planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Our results show that terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. Using a general circulation model we demonstrate that an ocean-covered planet orbiting in the habitable zone of an M-dwarf star has a higher global mean surface temperature than a planet orbiting the Sun (a G-dwarf star) at an equivalent stellar flux distance. The effect is even more pronounced when the albedos of snow and ice are lowered, indicating the importance of the spectral dependence of surface ice and snow on climate for these planets. We find that the sensitivity of climate to changes in stellar insolation for M-dwarf planets is weaker than for planets orbiting stars with greater visible and near-UV radiation. While a planet orbiting the Sun becomes ice-covered with an 8% reduction in stellar insolation, a similar planet orbiting an M dwarf requires a 27% reduction to become ice-covered. A 2% reduction in stellar insolation is all that is required for global ice cover on a planet orbiting an F-dwarf star. Consequently the habitable zone for surface liquid water on planets with Earth-like greenhouse gas concentrations may be ~12% wider for M-dwarf stars than for G-dwarf stars, and ~3% narrower for F-dwarf stars. Higher obliquities expand the outer habitable zone boundary for surface liquid water. Raising atmospheric CO<SUP>2</SUP> can reduce the ice-albedo effect on M-dwarf planets, but ~3-10 bars are required to entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow., Ice-covered worlds may harbor life beneath the ice within reservoirs of liquid water, or at water-rock interfaces in hydrothermal vent communities as have been observed in similar locales on Earth. One theory of life's emergence on Earth holds that initial metabolic and replication reactions took place in protobiotic cell membranes. These may have been composed of n- monocarboxylic acids (fatty acids) alone, rather than more complex phospholipid structures. Our experiments in the lab confirm that aqueous decanoic acid self-assembles into bilayer vesicles at standard temperature and pressure (25°C, 1 atm) in the pH range between 7 and 8.5, as indicated by stepwise increases in fluorescence induced by ultraviolet excitation of dye conjugated to decanoic acid solution. Life's chemical evolution in primordial oceans on Earth or elsewhere could have occurred over a range of temperatures, however. We explore the pH range for vesicle formation for temperatures from 0° C to 50° C. The role of pressure in the formation of protobiotic cell membranes is similarly important to whether life may have formed in deep-ocean environments on Earth, or on icy worlds in the solar system. Hydrostatic pressure has been shown to retard denaturation at above-optimal temperatures, but could affect the pH range for formation of protobiotic cell membranes., In 2008 and 2009, the EPOXI Discovery Mission of Opportunity re-used the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft to obtain observations of the distant Earth. These spatially- and temporally-resolved visible photometric and moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations were taken from vantage points above the Earth's Equator, and the North and South Poles. We have used the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planet Laboratory 3-D line-by-line, multiple-scattering Earth model to simulate light curves and spectra for comparison with the EPOXI data. We used this data/model comparison to validate the Earth model for the polar regions, and to explore detectable differences in light curve amplitude, color, atmospheric effects, surface temperature and compositional differences between the poles and the equator. We explore observational differences between a planet that is covered in clouds, and one that is ice-covered, through analysis of multi-wavelength variations in time-averaged light curve amplitude. Although the equatorial view of a Snowball Earth has a large ice surface fraction, as does a modern-day Earth that is viewed from above the pole of the planet, there are discernible differences in globally-averaged surface area between the two planetary conditions, as expressed by variations in light-curve amplitude over a 24-hour rotation period. We are able to quantify the amount of radiation that various surface types contribute to the overall measured intensity of an Earth-like planetary surface as a function of illumination geometry. This has implications for future exoplanet missions, which expect to identify Earth-like planets at different evolutionary phases and viewing geometries.

Numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy evolution are well-suited to explore the properties of those same media owing to the relative ease with which one can access physical quantities from complex, three-dimensional data. However, a difficulty arises when one tries to make direct “apple-to-apples” comparisons between observed spectra and simulated data. In an effort to provide a common language capable of linking theory and observation, we announce the release of Trident. Trident is a publicly available software tool that enables the creation of realistic synthetic absorption spectra from virtually all widely-used hydrodynamics simulation codes. Through user-controlled levels of spectral realism, direct comparisons between simulated and observed data become not only possible, but greatly simplified. We present the methods for extracting artificial quasar sightlines and generating spectra as well as early-stage applications of those spectra to intergalactic and circumgalactic absorption line studies., Understanding the complex nature of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) has been a target of numerous research efforts, both observationally and theoretically. While significant progress has been made in probing the structure and thermodynamic state of the CGM through the detection of metal line absorption systems using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), a complete picture of the physical mechanisms that produce the observed properties does not yet exist. Recent theoretical work has suggested that a delicate balance between radiative cooling and thermal feedback detemines whether or not the CGM is capable of sustaining a stable, multiphase medium that would allow cool clouds to precipitate out of the galactic halo. This new theoretical framework may provide the explanation for many observational results. In this project, we will detemine whether or not this elegant and simple precipitation model can be supported by physics-rich numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. We will use our simulations to gain a deeper understanding of the precipitation model and explore the ionization and temperature stucture of the CGM. Our analysis will include the comparison of realistic synthetic spectra to those produced by HST, using the newly-developed Trident software package., One of the most common ions used to track metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is OVI. Ion species in the IGM are typically assumed to be in ionization equilibrium, but owing to the low density of the plasma they may be significantly out of equilibrium. Divergences from equilibrium would make estimates of the amount and evolution of metals in the IGM incorrect. Using a new software package for building and solving complex chemical networks coupled to cosmological hydrodynamic + N-body simulations, we investigate the non-equilibrium properties of the IGM. In particular, we explore how significantly the ionization structure of the IGM diverges from the equilibrium state as a function of time and physical environment. Motivated by the abundant observational data that probes the intergalactic medium via OVI absorption lines in quasar spectra, we track all ionization states of atomic oxygen alongside those of hydrogen and helium. We use the results of these non-equilibrium simulations to characterize the mass content and ionization properties of the IGM and help interpret current observations made by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph., The chemical evolution of the Universe is a complicated process with countless facets that define its properties over the course of time. In the early Universe, the metal-free first stars were responsible for originally introducing metals into the pristine gas left over from the Big Bang. Once these metals became prevalent, they forever altered the thermodynamics of the Universe. Understanding precisely where these metals originated, where they end up, and the conditions they experience along the way is of great interest in the astrophysical community. In this work, I have used numerical simulations as a means of understanding two separate phenomena related to the chemical evolution the Universe. The first topic focuses on the question as to whether or not core-collapse supernovae in the high-redshift universe are capable of being ""dust factories"" for the production of galactic dust. To achieve this, I carried out idealized simulations of supernova ejecta clouds being impacted by reverse-shock blast waves. By post-processing the results of these simulations, I was able to estimate the amount of dust destruction that would occur due to thermal sputtering. In the most extreme scenarios, simulated with high relative velocities between the shock and the ejecta cloud and high gas metallicities, I find complete destruction for some grains species and only 44% dust mass survival for even the most robust species. This raises the question as to whether or not high-redshift supernova can produce dust masses in sufficient excess of the ∼1 Msun per event required to match observations of high-z galaxies. The second investigation was driven by the desire to find an answer to the missing baryon problem and a curiosity as to the impact that including a full non-equilibrium treatment of ionization chemistry has on simulations of the intergalactic medium. To address these questions, I have helped to develop Dengo, a new software package for solving complex chemical networks. Once this new package was integrated into Enzo, I carried out a set of cosmological simulations that served as both a test of the new solver and a confirmation that non-equilibrium ionization chemistry produces results that are drastically different from those that assume collisional ionization equilibrium. Although my analysis of these simulations is in its early stages, I find that the observable properties of the intergalactic medium change considerably. Continued efforts to run state-of-the-art simulations of the intergalactic medium using Dengo are warranted., In this dissertation talk, I present my efforts on adding non-equilibrium ionization metal chemistry to the adaptive mesh refinement, grid-based hybrid code (hydro + N-Body) Enzo. With my work, it is possible to track the populations of any number of atomic ion species during simulation runtime. This capability is of great scientific utility as many astrophysical problems may depend on the precise non-steady state ionization properties of the involved medium. Using this new machinery, I investigate the ionization structure of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in cosmological simulations of large-scale structure. In the WHIM, the ionization and recombination timescales become comparable to a Hubble time and non-equilibrium effects can be significant. The application of this new functionality in Enzo shines further light on the ""missing baryon"" problem by quantifying the amount of mass harbored in this particular temperature regime (10^5 - 10^7 K). The results of these simulations can be compared to observations of quasar sight lines in the ultraviolet wavelengths by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Such comparisons are useful in guiding future simulations and understanding the features present in observations. I also highlight some of my previous work on utilizing Enzo to understand the degree of dust destruction in supernova remnants., Following our previous work, we investigate through hydrodynamic simulations the destruction of newly formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova remnants. Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition. We vary the relative velocity between the reverse shock and ejecta clump to explore the effects of shock heating and cloud compression. Because supernova ejecta will be metal-enriched, we consider gas metallicities from Z/Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> = 1 to 100 and their influence on the cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal sputtering rates of embedded dust grains. We post-process the simulation output to calculate grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions. In the metallicity regime considered in this paper, the balance between increased radiative cooling and increased grain erosion depends on the impact velocity of the reverse shock. For slow shocks (v <SUB>shock</SUB> &lt;= 3000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), the amount of dust destruction is comparable across metallicities or in some cases is decreased with increased metallicity. For higher shock velocities (v <SUB>shock</SUB> &gt;= 5000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), an increase in metallicity from Z/Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> = 10 to 100 can lead to an additional 24% destruction of the initial dust mass. While the total dust destruction varies widely across grain species and simulation parameters, our most extreme cases result in complete destruction for some grain species and only 44% dust mass survival for the most robust species. These survival rates are important in understanding how early supernovae contribute to the observed dust masses in high-redshift galaxies., In following previous work, we present hydrodynamic simulations used to study the effects of dust destruction by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova remnants. As before (Silvia et al. 2010), we use an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump implanted with a population of Lagrangian particles that act as tracers of dust. These tracers represent a distribution of dust grains that vary in both species and size. Specifically, we investigate those cases in which the cloud initially has super-solar metal abundances (Z 1000 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>), as we expect the ejecta knots from supernova explosions to be extremely metal-enriched. A high abundance of metals has significant influence on both the cooling properties of the cloud and the thermal sputtering rates of the embedded dust grains. We also include a brief discussion about the difficulty of using the piecewise parabolic method for solving the hydrodynamic equations with high cooling rates produced by high metallicities. Through these simulations, we seek to quantify the fragmentation of ejecta clumps for comparison to observations of nearby supernova remnants and calculate the dust survival rate for these heavily metal-enriched cases. Estimates for dust survival in supernova shocks is critical in determining the source of dust at high redshift., We investigate through hydrodynamic simulations the destruction of newly formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova (SN) remnants. Using an idealized setup of a planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains in size and composition. We then post-process the simulation output to calculate the grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions. We explore the parameter space appropriate for this problem by altering the overdensity of the ejecta clumps and the speed of the reverse shocks. Since radiative cooling could lower the temperature of the medium in which the dust is embedded and potentially protect the dust by slowing or halting grain sputtering, we study the effects of different cooling methods over the timescale of the simulations. In general, our results indicate that grains with radii less than 0.1 μm are sputtered to much smaller radii and often destroyed completely, while larger grains survive their interaction with the reverse shock. We also find that, for high ejecta densities, the percentage of dust that survives is strongly dependent on the relative velocity between the clump and the reverse shock, causing up to 50% more destruction for the highest velocity shocks. The fraction of dust destroyed varies widely across grain species, ranging from total destruction of Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> grains to minimal destruction of Fe grains (only 20% destruction in the most extreme cases). C and SiO<SUB>2</SUB> grains show moderate to strong sputtering as well, with 38% and 80% mass loss. The survival rate of grains formed by early SNe is crucial in determining whether or not they can act as the ""dust factories"" needed to explain high-redshift dust., We investigate the destruction of newly-formed dust grains by sputtering in the reverse shocks of supernova remnants through hydrodynamic simulations. &amp;nbspUsing an idealized setup of planar shock impacting a dense, spherical clump, we implant a population of Lagrangian particles into the clump to represent a distribution of dust grains, then post-process the simulation output to calculate the grain sputtering for a variety of species and size distributions. We explore the parameter space appropriate for this problem by altering the over-density of the ejecta clump, the density profile of the clump, and the speed of the reverse shock. Since radiative cooling could lower the temperature of the medium in which the dust is embedded and potentially protect the dust by slowing or halting grain sputtering, we study the effects of different cooling methods over the time scale of the simulations. &amp;nbspWe also consider the influence of increased projectile mass on sputtering yields in metal-enriched plasmas. In general, results indicate that grains with radii less than 0.1 microns are sputtered to much smaller radii and often destroyed completely, while larger grains tend to survive their interaction with the reverse shock. The survival rate of grains formed by supernovae in the early universe is crucial in determining whether or not they can act as the ""dust factories” needed to explain high-redshift dust mass estimates., The periodic eclipses of the pre-main-sequence binary KH 15D have been explained by a circumbinary dust ring inclined to the orbital plane, which causes occultations of the stars as they pass behind the ring edge. We compute the extinction and forward scattering of light by the edge of the dust ring in order to explain (1) the gradual slope directly preceding total eclipse, (2) the gradual decline at the end of ingress, and (3) the slight rise in flux at mideclipse. The size of the forward-scattering halo indicates that the dust grains have a radius of a ~ 6(D/3 AU) μm, where D is the distance of the edge of the ring from the system barycenter. This dust size estimate agrees well with estimates of the dust grain size from polarimetry, adding to the evidence that the ring lies at several AU. Finally, the ratio of the fluxes during an eclipse to those not during an eclipse independently indicates that the ring lies at a few AU., The periodic eclipsing properties of the pre-main-sequence binary, KH 15D, are currently predicted to be the result of a circumbinary ring that is inclined to the orbital plane, which causes the system to be occulted. Using a collection of data that includes radial velocity measurements, a decade worth of detailed photometry, and a scattered assortment of archival photometry dating back to the 1950s, we attempt to confirm this theoretical model and further explain the detailed properties of KH 15D's light curve. Particularly, we seek to explain the gradual slope directly preceding total eclipse as well as the slight rise in flux at mid-eclipse. Our chosen explanation is that these features are caused by an intrinsic property of the dust that results in the forward scattering of the light from the binary.","['2017AAS...22915003S', '2015hst..prop14315S', '2015AAS...22525307S', '2013PhDT.......278S', '2013PhDT.......712S', '2013AAS...22121202S', '10.48550/arXiv.1111.0302', '2011arXiv1111.0302S', 'arXiv:1111.0302', '10.1088/0004-637X/748/1/12', '2012ApJ...748...12S', '2011BAAS...4325620S', '2011AAS...21725620S', '10.1088/0004-637X/715/2/1575', '10.48550/arXiv.1001.4793', '2010ApJ...715.1575S', 'arXiv:1001.4793', '2010arXiv1001.4793S', '2010BAAS...42..468S', '2010AAS...21545402S', '10.1086/588545', '10.48550/arXiv.0803.4275', '2008ApJ...681.1377S', 'arXiv:0803.4275', '2008arXiv0803.4275S', '2006BAAS...38.1198S', '2006AAS...20921607S']","[('dust', 41), ('grain', 30), ('simulation', 28), ('shock', 24), ('destruction', 15), ('metal', 14), ('supernova', 14), ('sputtering', 14), ('medium', 13), ('high', 13)]","[(('reverse', 'shock'), 12), (('dust', 'grain'), 11), (('grain', 'sputtering'), 8), (('intergalactic', 'medium'), 6), (('high', 'redshift'), 6), (('dust', 'mass'), 6), (('dust', 'destruction'), 5), (('supernova', 'remnant'), 5), (('radiative', 'cooling'), 4), (('grain', 'specie'), 4)]","[(('sputtering', 'reverse', 'shocks'), 4), (('reverse', 'shocks', 'supernova'), 4), (('idealized', 'setup', 'planar'), 4), (('setup', 'planar', 'shock'), 4), (('planar', 'shock', 'impacting'), 4), (('shock', 'impacting', 'dense'), 4), (('impacting', 'dense', 'spherical'), 4), (('dense', 'spherical', 'clump'), 4), (('population', 'lagrangian', 'particles'), 4), (('represent', 'distribution', 'dust'), 4)]",Dirty

The data were obtained using the echelle spectrograph on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas. The spectra cover the range 3700-7800Å. All clusters, excluding NGC 2808, were observed during lunar dark time in 2000 July. NGC 2808 was observed during lunar dark time in 2001 January. The total integration time for each cluster is summarized in Table 1, along with the general properties of the clusters. <P />(6 data files)., Our GC targets were chosen from the Revised Bologna Catalog (Galleti et al. 2004, Cat. J/A+A/416/917), and have all been previously spectroscopically confirmed as members of the M31 GC system. Our selection criteria required that the GCs be more luminous than V~17mag, but less luminous than V~15mag. <P />We obtained high-resolution IL spectra of the M31 GCs using the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. The data were taken over several observing runs from 2008 to 2012. In all observing runs, we used identical setups that utilized the D3 decker, which has a slit size of 1.7""x7.0"" and spectral resolution of R=24,000, which is sufficient to resolve individual spectral lines of GCs with vσ&gt;=7km/s. <P />(9 data files)., We present abundances of globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way and Fornax from integrated-light (IL) spectra. Our goal is to evaluate the consistency of the IL analysis relative to standard abundance analysis for individual stars in those same clusters. This sample includes an updated analysis of seven clusters from our previous publications and results for five new clusters that expand the metallicity range over which our technique has been tested. We find that the [Fe/H] measured from IL spectra agrees to ∼0.1 dex for GCs with metallicities as high as [Fe/H] = -0.3, but the abundances measured for more metal-rich clusters may be underestimated. In addition we systematically evaluate the accuracy of abundance ratios, [X/Fe], for Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I, Cu I, Y II, Zr I, Ba II, La II, Nd II, and Eu II. The elements for which the IL analysis gives results that are most similar to analysis of individual stellar spectra are Fe I, Ca I, Si I, Ni I, and Ba II. The elements that show the greatest differences include Mg I and Zr I. Some elements show good agreement only over a limited range in metallicity. More stellar abundance data in these clusters would enable more complete evaluation of the IL results for other important elements. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., We present a homogeneous analysis of high resolution spectra of globular clusters in three massive galaxies: the Milky Way, M31, and NGC 5128. We measure detailed abundance ratios for alpha, light, Fe-peak, and neutron capture elements using our technique for analyzing the integrated light spectra of globular clusters. For many of the heavy elements we provide a first look at the detailed chemistry of old populations in an early type galaxy. We discuss similarities and differences between the galaxies and the potential implications for their star formation histories., We present ages, [Fe/H] and abundances of the α elements Ca I, Si I, Ti I, Ti II, and light elements Mg I, Na I, and Al I for 31 globular clusters (GCs) in M31, which were obtained from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio &gt;60 echelle spectra of their integrated light (IL). All abundances and ages are obtained using our original technique for high-resolution IL abundance analysis of GCs. This sample provides a never before seen picture of the chemical history of M31. The GCs are dispersed throughout the inner and outer halo, from 2.5 kpc &lt; R <SUB>M31</SUB> &lt; 117 kpc. We find a range of [Fe/H] within 20 kpc of the center of M31, and a constant [Fe/H] ~ - 1.6 for the outer halo clusters. We find evidence for at least one massive GC in M31 with an age between 1 and 5 Gyr. The α-element ratios are generally similar to the Milky Way GC and field star ratios. We also find chemical evidence for a late-time accretion origin for at least one cluster, which has a different abundance pattern than other clusters at similar metallicity. We find evidence for star-to-star abundance variations in Mg, Na, and Al in the GCs in our sample, and find correlations of Ca, Mg, Na, and possibly Al abundance ratios with cluster luminosity and velocity dispersion, which can potentially be used to constrain GC self-enrichment scenarios. Data presented here were obtained with the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. <P />The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation., Integrated-light spectra for all of the LMC clusters were obtained by uniformly scanning the core regions of each cluster. All spectra were obtained with the 2.5m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas in 2000 December and 2001 January, with the exception of NGC 1718 which was observed with the MIKE double echelle spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope in 2006 November. <P />In CB11 (Colucci &amp; Bernstein 2012ApJ...749..124C), we presented an analysis of the [Fe/H] of 10 cool giant stars in the intermediate and young clusters of our sample. The stellar sample includes two stars in NGC 1978, three stars in NGC 1866, three stars in NGC 1711, and two stars in NGC 2100. All of the stellar spectra were taken with the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. <P />(4 data files)., We present [Fe/H], ages, and Ca abundances for an initial sample of 10 globular clusters in NGC 5128 obtained from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra of their integrated light. All abundances and ages are obtained using our original technique for high-resolution integrated light abundance analysis of globular clusters. The clusters have a range in [Fe/H] between -1.6 and -0.2. In this sample, the average [Ca/Fe] for clusters with [Fe/H] &lt;-0.4 is +0.37 ± 0.07, while the average [Ca/Fe] in our Milky Way (MW) and M31 GC samples is +0.29 ± 0.09 and +0.24 ± 0.10, respectively. This may imply a more rapid chemical enrichment history for NGC 5128 than for either the MW or M31. This sample provides the first quantitative picture of the chemical history of NGC 5128 that is directly comparable to what is available for the MW. Data presented here were obtained with the MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan Clay Telescope. <P />This Letter includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., We present a comparison of high-resolution, integrated-light, detailed chemical abundances for Galactic and extragalactic globular clusters in both massive galaxies and dwarf galaxies. We include measurements of Fe, Ca, Si, Na, and Al for globular cluster samples in the Milky Way, M31, Large Magellanic Cloud, and NGC 5128. These and other recent results from our group on M31 and NGC 5128 are the first chemical abundances derived from discrete absorption features in old stars beyond the Milky Way and its nearest neighbors. These abundances can provide both galaxy enrichment histories and constraints on globular cluster formation and evolution., As part of an ongoing program to measure detailed chemical abundances in nearby galaxies, we use a sample of young- to intermediate-age clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud with ages of 10 Myr-2 Gyr to evaluate the effect of isochrone parameters, specifically core convective overshooting, on Fe abundance results from high-resolution, integrated light spectroscopy. In this work we also obtain fiducial Fe abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy of the cluster individual member stars. We compare the Fe abundance results for the individual stars to the results from isochrones and integrated light spectroscopy to determine whether isochrones with convective overshooting should be used in our integrated light analysis of young- to intermediate-age (10 Myr-3 Gyr) star clusters. We find that when using the isochrones from the Teramo group, we obtain more accurate results for young- and intermediate-age clusters over the entire age range when using isochrones without convective overshooting. While convective overshooting is not the only uncertain aspect of stellar evolution, it is one of the most readily parameterized ingredients in stellar evolution models, and thus important to evaluate for the specific models used in our integrated light analysis. This work demonstrates that our method for integrated light spectroscopy of star clusters can provide unique tests for future constraints on stellar evolution models of young- and intermediate-age clusters. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., We present detailed chemical abundances in eight clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We measure abundances of 22 elements for clusters spanning a range in age of 0.05-12 Gyr, providing a comprehensive picture of the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the LMC. The abundances were obtained from individual absorption lines using a new method for analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 25,000), integrated-light (IL) spectra of star clusters. This method was developed and presented in Papers I, II, and III of this series. In this paper, we develop an additional IL χ<SUP>2</SUP>-minimization spectral synthesis technique to facilitate measurement of weak (~15 mÅ) spectral lines and abundances in low signal-to-noise ratio data (S/N ~ 30). Additionally, we supplement the IL abundance measurements with detailed abundances that we measure for individual stars in the youngest clusters (age &lt; 2 Gyr) in our sample. In both the IL and stellar abundances we find evolution of [α/Fe] with [Fe/H] and age. Fe-peak abundance ratios are similar to those in the Milky Way (MW), with the exception of [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe], which are sub-solar at high metallicities. The heavy elements Ba, La, Nd, Sm, and Eu are significantly enhanced in the youngest clusters. Also, the heavy to light s-process ratio is elevated relative to the MW ([Ba/Y] &gt;+0.5) and increases with decreasing age, indicating a strong contribution of low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch star ejecta to the interstellar medium throughout the later history of the LMC. We also find a correlation of IL Na and Al abundances with cluster mass in the sense that more massive, older clusters are enriched in the light elements Na and Al with respect to Fe, which implies that these clusters harbor star-to-star abundance variations as is common in the MW. Lower mass, intermediate-age, and young clusters have Na and Al abundances that are lower and more consistent with LMC field stars. Our results can be used to constrain both future chemical evolution models for the LMC and theories of globular cluster formation. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., We present chemical abundances and ages of stellar populations in M31, the nearest massive spiral galaxy. We have measured detailed chemical abundances for over 20 elements in a sample of 30 M31 globular clusters using high resolution spectra of their integrated light. The GCs are dispersed throughout the inner and outer halo, with galactocentric radii between 2.5 kpc and 117 kpc. We find a range of [Fe/H] within 20 kpc of the center of M31, and a constant [Fe/H] -1.6 for the outer halo GCs. We also derive cluster ages using Fe lines and present the first accurate age-metallicity relationship for the M31 GC system, with the result that the more metal-rich clusters in the sample are also the youngest. We find consistently high α-element abundances for a large range in [Fe/H] of -2.2 to -0.26. This implies that these M31 GCs formed in an environment with a high star formation rate, perhaps higher and more sustained than the early star formation rate of the Milky Way. We also measure the first abundances of 8 heavy neutron-capture elements, which are the first abundances of their kind in old stellar populations found more than 150 kpc from the Milky Way. These results provide the most comprehensive abundance history ever obtained for any other massive galaxy besides the Milky Way., We present detailed chemical abundances for $&gt;$20 elements in $\sim$30 globular clusters in M31. These results have been obtained using high resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda\sim$24,000) spectra of their integrated light and analyzed using our original method. The globular clusters have galactocentric radii between 2.5 kpc and 117 kpc, and therefore provide abundance patterns for different phases of galaxy formation recorded in the inner and outer halo of M31. We find that the clusters in our survey have a range in metallicity of $-2.2&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;-0.11$. The inner halo clusters cover this full range, while the outer halo globular clusters at R$&gt;$20 kpc have a small range in abundance of [Fe/H]$=-1.6 \pm 0.10$. We also measure abundances of alpha, r- and s-process elements. These results constitute the first abundance pattern constraints for old populations in M31 that are comparable to those known for the Milky Way halo., We present detailed chemical abundances of Fe, Ca and Ba for 17 globular clusters (GCs) in 5 Local Group dwarf galaxies: NGC 205, NGC 6822, WLM, the SMC and LMC. These abundances are part of a larger sample of over 20 individual elements measured in GCs in these galaxies using a new analysis method for high resolution, integrated light spectra. Our analysis also provides age and stellar population constraints. The existence of GCs in dwarf galaxies with a range of ages implies that there were episodes of rapid star formation (SF) throughout the history of these galaxies; the abundance ratios of these clusters suggest that the duration of these burst varied considerably from galaxy to galaxy. We find evolution of Fe, Ca, and Ba with age in the LMC, SMC, and NGC 6822 that is consistent with extended, lower-efficiency SF between bursts, with an increasing contribution of low-metallicity AGB ejecta at late times. Our sample of GCs in NGC 205 and WLM are predominantly old and metal-poor with high [Ca/Fe] ratios, implying that the early history of these galaxies was marked by consistently high SF rates., In this paper, we refine our method for the abundance analysis of high-resolution spectroscopy of the integrated light of unresolved globular clusters (GCs). This method was previously demonstrated for the analysis of old (&gt;10 Gyr) Milky Way (MW) GCs. Here, we extend the technique to young clusters using a training set of nine GCs in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, we use 20-100 Fe lines per cluster to successfully constrain the ages of old clusters to within a ~5 Gyr range, the ages of ~2 Gyr clusters to a 1-2 Gyr range, and the ages of the youngest clusters (0.05-1 Gyr) to a ~200 Myr range. We also demonstrate that we can measure [Fe/H] in clusters with any age less than 12 Gyr with similar or only slightly larger uncertainties (0.1-0.25 dex) than those obtained for old MW GCs (0.1 dex) the slightly larger uncertainties are due to the rapid evolution in stellar populations at these ages. In this paper, we present only Fe abundances and ages. In the next paper in this series, we present our complete analysis of ~20 elements for which we are able to measure abundances. For several of the clusters in this sample, there are no high-resolution abundances in the literature from individual member stars; our results are the first detailed chemical abundances available. The spectra used in this paper were obtained at Las Campanas with the echelle on the du Pont Telescope and with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan Clay Telescope. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile., We present detailed chemical abundances of 21 elements in 8 clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These abundances were obtained from individual absorption lines using our new method of analyzing high resolution (R 25,000) integrated-light spectra of globular clusters. We have previously used old (&gt;10 Gyr) Milky Way clusters to demonstrate that we obtain accuracies comparable to those obtained from analysis of individual RGB stars. Here we use the LMC, which contains the necessary sample of clusters over a wide age range, to demonstrate for the first time that this abundance analysis method can be successfully applied to clusters of any age (50 Myrs to 13 Gyrs). Uniformly obtaining chemical abundances of clusters over a wide range in age allows us to investigate the chemical evolution history of the LMC in great detail. We find a spread in [α/Fe] at constant [Fe/H], as well as evolution of [α/Fe] with [Fe/H] and age. In older clusters, the light elements Na, Al, and Mg appear to be strongly affected by inter-cluster abundance variations; intermediate age and young clusters have light element abundances that are more consistent with LMC field stars. The heavy elements Ba, La, Nd, Sm, and Eu are enhanced in the youngest clusters. The heavy to light s-process ratio is elevated, ([Ba/Y] &gt;+0.5), and increases with decreasing age, indicating a strong contribution of low-metallicity AGB star ejecta throughout the later history of the LMC. These results are consistent with prolonged, low-efficiency star formation between short bursts of more rapid star formation that resulted in massive, surviving clusters. Detailed chemical abundances measured using our new method can be obtained for galaxies within 4 Mpc using current telescopes. These abundances can be used to constrain the star formation history of galaxies in and beyond the Local Group in unprecedented detail., We present the first detailed chemical abundances of extragalactic globular clusters in the Local Group using a new method for analyzing high-resolution (λΔλ 25,000) integrated light spectra. Here we present new detailed abundances for 20 α, Fe-peak, and neutron capture elements obtained from individual spectral lines for clusters in M31, the dwarf irregular NGC 6822, and the LMC. Our new analysis method (derived from standard RGB star analysis methods and as accurate) also provides age constraints for unresolved clusters. As we demonstrate on LMC clusters, our analysis methods let us measure accurate abudances and ages for clusters of all ages. The high S/N, high resolution spectra needed for detailed abundance analysis can be obtained for unresolved clusters in galaxies within 4 Mpc with current telescopes. Application of this new method to large samples of globular clusters in a range in environments and of a variety of ages will help to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies of different masses, as well as put constraints on merger history and hierarchical buildup of massive galaxies. As globular clusters form during major episodes of star formation, they are important tracers of the assembly history of galaxies, especially at distances where detailed spectroscopic studies of individual stars are not possible. The detailed abundances presented here for globular clusters in M31 are the first such measurements for old stars in a large galaxy other than the Milky Way., Globular clusters (GCs) are luminous, observationally accessible objects that are good tracers of the total star formation and evolutionary history of galaxies. We present the first detailed chemical abundances for GCs in M31 using a new abundance analysis technique designed for high resolution, integrated light (IL) spectra of GCs. This technique has recently been developed using a training set of old GCS in the Milky Way (MW), and makes possible detailed chemical evolution studies of distant galaxies, where high resolution abundance analysis of individual stars are not obtainable. For the 5 M31 GCs presented here, we measure abundances of 14 elements: Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, and Ba. We find the M31 GCs have ages (&gt;10 Gyr) and chemical properties similar to MW GCs, including an enhancement in the alpha-elements Ca, Ti and Si of [alpha/Fe]∼ +0.4. In this thesis, we also further develop this IL abundance analysis method to include GCs of ages 10 Myr--12 Gyrs using GCs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which contains the necessary sample of clusters over this wide age range. This work demonstrates for the first time that this IL abundance analysis method can be used on clusters of all ages, and that ages can be constrained to within 1--2 Gyr for clusters with ages of ∼2 Gyr and within a few 100 Myr for clusters with ages &lt;1 Gyr. We find that we can measure [Fe/H] in clusters with ages &lt;12 Gyrs with similar or only slightly larger uncertainties (0.1--0.25 dex) than those obtained for old GCs; the slightly larger uncertainties are due to the rapid evolution in stellar populations at these ages. Using the LMC clusters, we also investigate the effects of statistical fluctuations in the theoretical cluster stellar populations used in our analysis. We also develop strategies to allow for statistical variations in these stellar populations, and find that the stability of the Fe line abundance solution can provide tight constraints on the appropriate theoretical stellar populations. Detailed chemical abundances of 22 elements are reported for six LMC clusters., We report the first detailed chemical abundances for five globular clusters (GCs) in M31 from high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) spectroscopy of their integrated light (IL). These GCs are the first in a larger set of clusters observed as part of an ongoing project to study the formation history of M31 and its GC population. The data presented here were obtained with the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck I telescope and are analyzed using a new IL spectra analysis method that we have developed. In these clusters, we measure abundances for Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, and Ba, ages &gt;=10 Gyr, and a range in [Fe/H] of -0.9 to -2.2. As is typical of Milky Way GCs, we find these M31 GCs to be enhanced in the α-elements Ca, Si, and Ti relative to Fe. We also find [Mg/Fe] to be low relative to other [α/Fe], and [Al/Fe] to be enhanced in the IL abundances. These results imply that abundances of Mg, Al (and likely O, Na) recovered from IL do display the inter- and intra-cluster abundance variations seen in individual Milky Way GC stars, and that special care should be taken in the future in interpreting low- or high-resolution IL abundances of GCs that are based on Mg-dominated absorption features. Fe-peak and the neutron-capture elements Ba and Y also follow Milky Way abundance trends. We also present high-precision velocity dispersion measurements for all five M31 GCs, as well as independent constraints on the reddening toward the clusters from our analysis. <P />The data presented herein were obtained at the W.

We generate realistic input binary populations in all observing fields of the Rubin Observatory, simulate the expected observations in each filter, and attempt to characterize the EBs using these simulated observations. In our models, we predict that the baseline cadence will enable the Rubin Observatory to observe about three million EBs; our technique could recover and characterize nearly one million of these in the field and thousands within star clusters. If the colossus cadence is used, the number of recovered EBs would increase by an overall factor of about 1.7 in the field and in globular clusters, and a factor of about 3 in open clusters. Including semidetached and contact systems could increase the number of recovered EBs by an additional factor of about 2.5 to 3. Regardless of the cadence, observations from the Rubin Observatory could reveal statistically significant physical distinctions between the distributions of EB orbital elements between the field, GCs, and OCs. Simulations such as these can be used to bias correct the sample of Rubin Observatory EBs to study the intrinsic properties of the full binary populations in the field and star clusters., Our Radial Velocity (RVel) survey of M67 began using the CfA Digital Speedometers (DS) on the Multi Mirror Telescope (MMT) and the 1.5m Tillinghast Reflector of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, both on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. A third DS was later commissioned at the 1.5m Wyeth Reflector at Oak Ridge Observatory in the Town of Harvard, Massachusetts, where M67 data were also collected. Earlier RV data from the Palomar Hale 5m observatory and the CORAVEL instrument at Haute-Provence were also added to the sample. Subsequently, observational facilities were expanded to include the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES). Observations of M67 with the Hydra MOS on the WIYN 3.5m began on 2005 January 15 and continue to the present day. <P />(3 data files)., We present and analyze 120 spectroscopic binary and triple cluster members of the old (4 Gyr) open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). As a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics, M67 is a key cluster in the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS); radial-velocity (RV) observations of M67 are ongoing and extend back over 45 yr, incorporating data from seven different telescopes, and allowing us to detect binaries with orbital periods ≲10<SUP>4</SUP> days. Our sample contains 1296 stars (604 cluster members) with magnitudes of 10 ≤ V ≤ 16.5 (about 1.3-0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), from the giants down to ∼4 mag below the main-sequence turnoff, and extends in radius to 30' (7.4 pc at a distance of 850 pc, or ∼7 core radii). This paper focuses primarily on the main-sequence binaries, but orbital solutions are also presented for red giants, yellow giants, and sub-subgiants. Out to our period detection limit and within our magnitude and spatial domain, we find a global main-sequence incompleteness-corrected binary fraction of 34% ± 3%, which rises to 70% ± 17% in the cluster center. We derive a tidal circularization period of ${P}_{\mathrm{circ}}={11.0}_{-1.0}^{+1.1}\,\mathrm{days}$ &lt;!-- --&gt; . We also analyze the incompleteness-corrected distributions of binary orbital elements and masses. The period distribution rises toward longer periods. The eccentricity distribution, beyond P<SUB>circ</SUB>, is consistent with a uniform distribution. The mass-ratio distribution is also consistent with a uniform distribution. Overall, these M67 binaries are closely consistent with similar binaries in the galactic field, as well as with the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. WOCS. 83., About a century ago, Jeans (1919) discovered that if binary stars reach a state approximating energy equipartition, for example, through many dynamical encounters that exchange energy, their eccentricity distribution can be described by {dN}/{de}=2e. This is referred to as the thermal eccentricity distribution, and has been widely used for initial conditions in theoretical investigations of binary stars. However, observations suggest that the eccentricity distributions of most observed binaries, and particularly those with masses ≲5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, are flatter than thermal and follow more closely to a uniform distribution. Nonetheless, it is often argued that dynamical interactions in a star cluster would quickly thermalize the binaries, which could justify imposing a thermal eccentricity distribution at birth for all binaries. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this assumption. We develop our own rapid semi-analytic model for binary evolution in star clusters, and also compare it with detailed N-body and Monte Carlo star cluster models. We show that, for nearly all binaries, dynamical encounters fail to convert an initially uniform eccentricity distribution to thermal within a star cluster’s lifetime. Thus, if a thermal eccentricity distribution is observed, it is likely imprinted upon formation rather than through subsequent long-term dynamical processing. Theoretical investigations that initialize all binaries with a thermal distribution will make incorrect predictions for the evolution of the binary population. Such models may overpredict the merger rate for binaries with modest orbital separations by a factor of about two., Firefly provides interactive exploration of particle-based data in the browser. The user can filter, display vector fields, and toggle the visibility of their customizable datasets all on-the-fly. Different Firefly visualizations, complete with preconfigured data and camera view-settings, can be shared by URL. As Firefly is written in WebGL, it can be hosted online, though Firefly can also be used locally, without an internet connection. Firefly was developed with simulations of galaxy formation in mind but is flexible enough to display any particle-based data. Other features include a stereoscopic 3D picture mode and mobile compatibility., High-mass stars often pair up to form binary systems. Observations reveal that the stars in such systems are born farther apart than was formerly thought, casting fresh light on an enduring debate about star formation., Sub-subgiants (SSGs) are a new class of stars that are optically redder than normal main-sequence stars and fainter than normal subgiant stars. SSGs, as well as the possibly related red stragglers (which fall to the red of the giant branch), occupy a region of the color-magnitude diagram that is predicted to be devoid of stars by standard stellar evolution theory. In previous papers we presented the observed demographics of these sources and defined possible theoretical formation channels through isolated binary evolution, the rapid stripping of a subgiant’s envelope, and stellar collisions. SSGs offer key tests for single- and binary-star evolution and stellar collision models. In this paper, we synthesize these findings to discuss the formation frequencies through each of these channels. The empirical data, our analytic formation rate calculations, and analyses of SSGs in a large grid of Monte Carlo globular cluster models suggest that the binary evolution channels may be the most prevalent, though all channels appear to be viable routes to SSG creation (especially in higher-mass globular clusters). Multiple formation channels may operate simultaneously to produce the observed SSG population. Finally, many of these formation pathways can produce stars in both the SSG and red straggler (and blue straggler) regions of the color-magnitude diagram, in some cases as different stages along the same evolutionary sequence., Sub-subgiants are stars that are observed to be redder than normal main-sequence stars and fainter than normal subgiant (and giant) stars in an optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The red straggler stars, which lie redward of the red giant branch, may be related and are often grouped together with the sub-subgiants in the literature. These stars defy our standard theory of single-star evolution and are important tests for binary evolution and stellar collision models. In total, we identify 65 sub-subgiants (SSG) and red stragglers (RS) in 16 open and globular star clusters from the literature; 50 of these, including 43 sub-subgiants, pass our strict membership selection criteria (though the remaining sources may also be cluster members). In addition to their unique location on the CMD, we find that at least 58% (25/43) of sub-subgiants in this sample are X-ray sources with typical 0.5-2.5 keV luminosities of order 10<SUP>30</SUP>-10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Their X-ray luminosities and optical-to-X-ray flux ratios are similar to those of RS CVn active binaries. At least 65% (28/43) of the sub-subgiants in our sample are variables, 21 of which are known to be radial-velocity binaries. Typical variability periods are ≲15 days. At least 33% (14/43) of the sub-subgiants are Hα emitters. These observational demographics provide strong evidence that binarity is important for sub-subgiant formation. Finally, we find that the number of sub-subgiants per unit mass increases toward lower-mass clusters, such that the open clusters in our sample have the highest specific frequencies of sub-subgiants., Open clusters enable a deep dive into blue straggler characteristics. Recent work shows that the binary properties (frequency, orbital elements and companion masses and evolutionary states) of the blue stragglers are the most important diagnostic for determining their origins. To date the multi-epoch radial-velocity observations necessary for characterizing these blue straggler binaries have only been carried out in open clusters. In this paper, I highlight recent results in the open clusters NGC 188, NGC 2682 (M67) and NGC 6819. The characteristics of many of the blue stragglers in these open clusters point directly to origins through mass transfer from an evolved donor star. Additionally, a handful of blue stragglers show clear signatures of past dynamical encounters. These comprehensive, diverse and detailed observations also reveal important challenges for blue straggler formation models (and particularly the mass-transfer channel), which we must overcome to fully understand the origins of blue straggler stars and other mass-transfer products., This is the first in a series of papers studying the dynamical state of the old open cluster M67 through precise radial velocities. This is also the paper LXVII of the WIYN Open Cluster Study. <P />Our radial velocity survey of M67 began as part of the dissertation work of Mathieu (1983PhDT.........8M), taking advantage of the CfA Digital Speedometers (DS). Three nearly identical instruments were used, initially on the MMT (from HJD2445337 to HJD2450830) and 1.5m Tillinghast Reflector (from HJD2444184 to HJD2454958) at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopins, Arizona, and then later on the 1.5m Wyeth Reflector (from HJD2445722 to HJD2453433) at the Oak Ridge Observatory in the Town of Harvard, Massachusetts. Subsequently the M67 target samples were expanded several times. Radial velocities measurements from other programs were integrated into the database, and our observational facilities were extended to include Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) at the WIYN Observatory (from HJD2453386 to HJD2456709) and the new Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) on the Tillinghast Reflector (from HJD2455143 to HJD2456801). Details about the telescopes, observing procedures, and data reductions of spectra obtained with the CfA DS can be found in Latham (1985srv..conf...21L, 1992ASPC...32..110L). The corresponding information for spectra obtained with Hydra at the WIYN Observatory can be found in Geller et al. 2008 (cat. J/AJ/135/2264), Geller et al. 2010 (cat. J/AJ/139/1383) and Hole et al. (2009). TRES is a stabilized fiber-fed echelle spectrograph with a CCD detector and resolution of 44000. <P />The initial CfA sample was defined in 1982. The last surviving CfA Digital Speedometer, on the 1.5m Tillinghast Reflector, was retired in the summer of 2009. Over the following five observing seasons, TRES was used to continue the radial velocity observations of targets (mostly binaries) from both the CfA and the WIYN samples. Importantly, Roger Griffin and James Gunn also had a radial velocity program for M67 from 1971 to 1982 at the Palomar Hale 5m telescope (from HJD2440952 to HJD2445297), which they supplemented with contemporaneous observations obtained with the CORAVEL instrument (from HJD2444340 to HJD2446413) at Haute Provence for five of the binaries. Their target sample was very similar to our initial sample. We refer to the target stars and the measurements taken at all telescope/instrument pairs except WIYN/Hydra as the CfA sample and data. As of 2015 February, there are 447 stars in the CfA sample. <P />WIYN observations of M67 began on 2005 January 15 as part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS; Mathieu, 2000ASPC..198..517M). In total there are 1278 stars within the WIYN stellar sample; 382 of these stars are also in the CfA stellar sample. <P />(1 data file)., We present results from 13776 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of 1278 candidate members of the old (4 Gyr) open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). The measurements are the results of a long-term survey that includes data from seven telescopes with observations for some stars spanning over 40 years. For narrow-lined stars, RVs are measured with precisions ranging from about 0.1 to 0.8 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The combined stellar sample reaches from the brightest giants in the cluster down to about 4 mag below the main-sequence turnoff (V=16.5), covering a mass range of about 1.34 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> to 0.76 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. Spatially, the sample extends to a radus of 30 arcmin (7.4 pc in projection at a distance of 850 pc or 6-7 core radii). We find M67 to have a mean RV of +33.64 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (with an internal precision of ±0.03 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) well separated from the mean velocity of the field. For stars with ≥slant 3 measurements, we derive RV membership probabilities and identify RV variables, finding 562 cluster members, 142 of which show significant RV variability. We use these cluster members to construct a color-magnitude diagram and identify a rich sample of stars that lie far from the standard single star isochrone, including the well-known blue stragglers, sub-subgiants and yellow giants. These exotic stars have a binary frequency of (at least) 80%, more than three times that detected for stars in the remainder of the sample. We confirm that the cluster is mass segregated, finding the binaries to be more centrally concentrated than the single stars in our sample at the 99.8% confidence level (and at the 98.7% confidence level when only considering main-sequence stars). The blue stragglers are centrally concentrated as compared to the solar-type main-sequence single stars in the cluster at the 99.7% confidence level. Accounting for measurement precision, we derive an RV dispersion in M67 of 0.80 ± 0.04 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for our sample of single main-sequence stars, subgiants and giants with V≤slant 15.5. When corrected for undetected binaries, this sample yields a true RV dispersion of {0.59}<SUB>-0.06</SUB><SUP>+0.07</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The radial distribution of the velocity dispersion is consistent with an isothermal distribution within our stellar sample. Using the cluster RV dispersion, we estimate a virial mass for the cluster of {2100}<SUB>-550</SUB><SUP>+610</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. <P />WIYN Open Cluster Study. LXVII., Strong encounters between single stars and binaries play a pivotal role in the evolution of star clusters. Such encounters can also dramatically modify the orbital parameters of binaries, exchange partners in and out of binaries, and are a primary contributor to the rate of physical stellar collisions in star clusters. Often, these encounters are studied under the approximation that they happen quickly enough and within a small enough volume to be considered isolated from the rest of the cluster. In this paper, we study the validity of this assumption through the analysis of a large grid of single-binary and binary-binary scattering experiments. For each encounter we evaluate the encounter duration, and compare this with the expected time until another single or binary star will join the encounter. We find that for lower-mass clusters, similar to typical open clusters in our Galaxy, the percent of encounters that will be “interrupted” by an interloping star or binary may be 20%-40% (or higher) in the core, though for typical globular clusters we expect ≲1% of encounters to be interrupted. Thus, the assumption that strong encounters occur in relative isolation breaks down for certain clusters. Instead, many strong encounters develop into more complex “mini-clusters,” which must be accounted for in studying, for example, the internal dynamics of star clusters, and the physical stellar collision rate., The two Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters, NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, are approximately the same chronological age (∼30 Myr), but show different radial trends in binary frequency. The F-type stars (1.3-2.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) in NGC 1818 have a binary frequency that decreases toward the core, while the binary frequency for stars of similar mass in NGC 1805 is flat with radius, or perhaps bimodal (with a peak in the core). We show here, through detailed N-body modeling, that both clusters could have formed with the same primordial binary frequency and with binary orbital elements and masses drawn from the same distributions (defined from observations of open clusters and the field of our Galaxy). The observed radial trends in binary frequency for both clusters are best matched with models that have initial substructure. Furthermore, both clusters may be evolving along a very similar dynamical sequence, with the key difference that NGC 1805 is dynamically older than NGC 1818. The F-type binaries in NGC 1818 still show evidence of an initial period of rapid dynamical disruptions (which occur preferentially in the core), while NGC 1805 has already begun to recover a higher core binary frequency, owing to mass segregation (which will eventually produce a distribution in binary frequency that rises only toward the core, as is observed in old Milky Way star clusters). This recovery rate increases for higher-mass binaries, and therefore even at one age in one cluster, we predict a similar dynamical sequence in the radial distribution of the binary frequency as a function of binary primary mass., , We propose a study to determine the formation pathways of a new class of stars: the ""sub-subgiants"" {a.k.a ""red stragglers""}, identified in star clusters as stars that are redder than the main sequence but fainter than the giant branch in an optical color-magnitude diagram. First discovered about 15 years ago in the open cluster M67, today there are 47 sub-subgiants known in both open and globular clusters, most discovered using a combination of HST and Chandra data. Yet their origins remain a mystery. We propose a rigorous theoretical investigation into the origins of sub-subgiants, exploring all likely formation channels - through detailed modeling of stellar and binary evolution and stellar mergers - and specifically targeting the ability of each formation channel to explain the observed HST optical and UV magnitudes., The massive (13,000 - 26,000 Msun), young (15 - 30 Myr) Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 reveals an unexpected increasing binary frequency with radius for F-type stars (1.3 - 2.2 Msun). This is in contrast to many older star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, and find that many different initial configurations evolve to reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries on approximately a crossing time, preferentially in the cluster core. At later times mass segregation processes dominate binary disruption and transform the radial distribution of the binary frequency first into a bimodal distribution (interestingly similar to those observed for blue stragglers in many globular clusters), and then into a radial distribution that peaks only in the core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters., Binary stars, and particularly the short-period ``hard'' binaries, govern the dynamical evolution of star clusters and determine the formation rates and mechanisms for exotic stars like blue stragglers and X-ray sources. Understanding the near-primordial hard-binary population of star clusters is of primary importance for dynamical models of star clusters, which have the potential to greatly advance our understanding of star cluster evolution. Yet the binary frequencies and distributions of binary orbital parameters (period, eccentricity, etc.) for young coeval stellar populations are poorly known, due to a lack of necessary observations. The young (~540 Myr) open cluster M37 hosts a rich binary population that can be used to empirically define these initial conditions. Importantly, this cluster has been the target of a comprehensive WIYN/Hydra radial-velocity (RV) survey, from which we have already identified a nearly complete sample of 329 solar-type (1.5 &lt;=M [M_⊙] &lt;=1.0) members in M37. Of these stars, 82 show significant RV variability, indicative of a binary companion. We propose to build upon these data with a multi-epoch RV survey using WIYN/Hydra to derive kinematic orbital solutions for these 82 binaries in M37. This project was granted time in 2013B and scheduled for later this year. We anticipate that about half of the detected binaries in M37 will acquire enough RV measurements (&gt;=10) in 2013B to begin searching for orbital solutions. With this proposal and perhaps one additional semester we should achieve &gt;=10 RV measurements for the remaining binaries., The massive (13,000 - 26,000 solar masses), young (15 - 30 Myr) Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 reveals an unexpected increasing binary frequency with radius for F-type stars (1.3 - 2.2 solar masses). This is in contrast to many older star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, and find that many different initial configurations evolve to reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries on approximately a crossing time, preferentially in the cluster core. At later times mass segregation processes dominate binary disruption and transform the radial distribution of the binary frequency first into a bimodal distribution, and then into a radial distribution that peaks only in the core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters., The massive (13,000-26,000 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and young (15-30 Myr) Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC 1818 reveals an unexpected increasing binary frequency with radius for F-type stars (1.3-2.2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). This is in contrast to many older star clusters that show a decreasing binary frequency with radius. We study this phenomenon with sophisticated N-body modeling, exploring a range of initial conditions, from smooth virialized density distributions to highly substructured and collapsing configurations. We find that many of these models can reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest preference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the observed radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries (with semi-major axes, a &gt;~ 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~5.4 Myr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes the binaries to sink toward the core. After roughly one initial half-mass relaxation time (t <SUB>rh</SUB>(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution becomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated toward the core, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that marches outward with time. After 4-6 t <SUB>rh</SUB>(0), the rising distribution in the halo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only toward the core. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls toward the core (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises toward the core (as for older star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence owing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters., The Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope is ideally suited for systematic radial-velocity studies of open star clusters. As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) we are conducting comprehensive radial-velocity surveys 0.5 km/s single-measurement precision) of the solar-type stars in a select sample of open clusters that span a wide range in age and metallicity using WIYN/Hydra. In this talk, I will focus on our most complete cluster: NGC 188. At an age of 7 Gyr, NGC 188 is dynamically evolved, having lived through tens of half-mass relaxation times. WIYN/Hydra data reveal a rich binary population amongst the solar-type main-sequence, red-giant and blue-straggler stars, and allow us to derive orbital solutions for the majority of our detected binaries (out to orbital periods of ~3000 days). This detailed knowledge of the NGC 188 binaries, and those in other WOCS clusters, enable us to develop a highly accurate N-body model of NGC 188, which reveals the dynamical history of the cluster’s rich binary population. WIYN/Hydra data and N-body modeling have been particularly important for our understanding of the NGC 188 blue stragglers. Our WIYN observations show that the NGC 188 blue stragglers have a strikingly high binary frequency of (at least) 76%, most having periods near 1000 days, and a companion-mass distribution that is narrow and peaked at ~0.5 solar masses. These characteristics are significantly different from those of the normal main-sequence stars. The combination of WIYN/Hydra data, recent HST observations in the FUV, and sophisticated N-body modeling of the cluster, point to mass transfer as the dominant formation channel for the NGC 188 blue stragglers, addressing a decades-long theoretical debate about their origins., Open clusters are laboratories for testing theories of binary evolution and dynamics against detailed observations. As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS), we are currently observing several open clusters spanning a wide range in age and metallicity, with primary goals of determining the binary frequencies and distributions of binary orbital parameters for their solar-type stars. Currently, the three WOCS clusters with the most complete data sets are M35 (0.15 Gyr), M67 (4 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Despite the large differences in age, we find that all three of these rich clusters have remarkably similar solar-type binaries that are also consistent with comparable binaries in the Galactic field. These data have been critical for guiding our sophisticated open cluster N-body simulations, which enable us to investigate the dynamical evolution of rich binary populations and the production of exotic stars, like blue stragglers, within open clusters., Dynamical encounters involving binary stars influence the dynamical evolution of star clusters. Exotic stars, including some blue stragglers and X-ray sources, are observable products of the more “violent” dynamical encounters that can result in the significant hardening of binary orbits and even direct stellar collisions. Yet the majority of stellar encounters, and particularly those in open clusters, are less energetic and do not result in such dramatic changes to the binaries. Indeed our sophisticated N-body model of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 predicts that, apart from stellar exotica, the signatures of past dynamical encounters may only be detectable by examining the orbital parameters, and particularly the eccentricities, of the binaries with periods much longer than 1000 days. Furthermore, our N-body model predicts that the distributions of orbital parameters of the short-period (roughly P&lt;1000 days) solar-type binaries will remain roughly constant, even after many Gyr of evolution within a rich open cluster. This suggests that observations of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters may still provide valuable information about their primordial binary populations., Following on from a recently completed radial-velocity survey of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we studied in detail the solar-type hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we investigate the dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated N-body model. Importantly, we employ the observed binary properties of the young (180 Myr) open cluster M35, where possible, to guide our choices for parameters of the initial binary population. We apply pre-main-sequence tidal circularization and a substantial increase to the main-sequence tidal circularization rate, both of which are necessary to match the observed tidal circularization periods in the literature, including that of NGC 188. At 7 Gyr the main-sequence solar-type hard-binary population in the model matches that of NGC 188 in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital parameters. This agreement between the model and observations is in a large part due to the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries. Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those with P &gt;~ 1000 days begin to show potentially observable evidence for modifications by dynamical encounters, even after 7 Gyr of evolution within the star cluster. This emphasizes the importance of defining accurate initial conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is best accomplished through comparisons with observations of young open clusters like M35. Furthermore, this finding suggests that observations of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters can provide valuable information on their primordial binary populations. However, despite the model's success at matching the observed solar-type main-sequence population, the model underproduces blue stragglers and produces an overabundance of long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries as compared with the true cluster. We explore several potential solutions to the paucity of blue stragglers and conclude that the model dramatically underproduces blue stragglers through mass-transfer processes. We suggest that common-envelope evolution may have been incorrectly imposed on the progenitors of the spurious long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries, which perhaps instead should have gone through stable mass transfer to create blue stragglers, thereby bringing both the number and binary frequency of the blue straggler population in the model into agreement with the true blue stragglers in NGC 188. Thus, improvements in the physics of mass transfer and common-envelope evolution employed in the model may in fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This project highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations, both of which have only recently matured sufficiently to enable such a project, and underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of star cluster dynamics. <P />WIYN Open Cluster Study.

Some recent observations of QSO hint at the possible time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant. We analyzed the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model which posits the existence of a cosmological scalar field and allows the field and the fine structure constant to evolve with the expansion of the universe. Using Principal Component Analysis of the CMB, we impose new constraints to these models. We also explore the relationship between the matter density and electromagnetic energy of the nucleus in these models, a key theoretical quantity that is degenerate with limits to the energy scale of new physics in these models, highlighting assumptions and limitations of past analyses. We assess the impact of the use of energy non-conserving equations in past modeling of this theory, and also explore the additional impact of dark energy constraints on such models. <P />This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation through Grant award NSF 2112846., axionCAMB is a modified version of the publicly available code <A href=""http://ascl.net/1102.026"">CAMB</A> (ascl:1102.026). axionCAMB computes cosmological observables for comparison with data. This is normally the CMB power spectra (T,E,B,\phi in auto and cross power), but also includes the matter power spectrum., Ultra-light axions (ULAs) are a promising dark matter candidate, with motivation from string theory, offering a possible resolution to small-scale challenges to the ΛCDM paradigm. ULAs are already known to observably alter primary CMB anisotropies and the gravitational lensing of the CMB. Here it is shown that by affecting the growth of structure in the universe, ultra-light axions also change the signature of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect [the Compton up-scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by bulk flows] on the CMB. The ULA impact on anisotropy power spectra and cluster pairwise velocity measurements from CMB + large-scale-structure surveys is determined, and prospects for future CMB experimental efforts (e.g. CMB-S4) are assessed., Axions are a promising dark-matter candidate. Ultra-light axions (ULAs) are motivated by string scenarios and could mitigate small-scale challenges to the ΛCDM paradigm. ULAs will be stringently tested by future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments and large-scale structure surveys. It is challenging to compute cosmological observables in ULA scenarios, due to the fact that the ULA field oscillates on time scales much shorter than the Hubble time. In past work, an effective fluid approximation (in which axions are modeled as a fluid with a structure-suppressing sound speed) is used to make computations feasible and obtain constraints. Here this approximation is tested against a complete solution of the ULA equations, comparing the induced error of CMB observables with the sensitivity of current and future experiments. In the most constrained mass range for a ULA dark matter component (10<SUP>-27</SUP> eV ≤ m<SUB>a</SUB> ≤ 10<SUP>-25</SUP> eV), the induced bias on ULA parameters from Planck is less than 1σ. In the cosmic-variance limit (including temperature and polarization data), the potential bias on parameters is 4-10σ at Fisher level; this implies that tests of ULAs using data from future efforts like CMB Stage-4 will require more precise methods. It is also found using the exact and effective fluid calculations that if ULAs compose all the dark matter, the suppression of power relative to standard cold dark matter scales with wave number as k<SUP>-8</SUP>, rather than the often-used k<SUP>-16</SUP> 'fuzzy'-dark matter scaling, with possible implications for small-scale observables., We summarize the high-energy theoretical and astrophysical motivation for ultra-light axions. We summarize observational signatures and possibilities for the next decade, and make recommendations for future theoretical and observational work., Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are Gaussian and isotropic at linear order. The presence of long wavelength modulating fields, however, can introduce non-Gaussianity and statistical anisotropy in the CMB. For example, the dark matter present along the line of sight between observers and the last-scattering surface gravitationally lenses the background CMB. Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has already been detected at ~40 \sigma in Planck satellite data! There are discrepancies between the observed CMB lensing signal and expectations from $\Lambda$CDM theory, offering the opportunity to explore the possibility of other long wavelength modulating field, which might be able to relieve the tension between the predicted and observed amplitude of CMB weak lensing. A variety of particle-physics models for the origin of the baryon asymmetry and density fluctuations in the universe predict compensated isocurvature perturbations, spatial fluctuations in the relative densities of baryons and cold dark matter. It is also possible that the strength of the electromagnetic interaction is set by a novel scalar field with couplings to the standard model, sourcing spatial fluctuations in the fine structure constant. Here, the observational motivation for these models is reviewed and the imprint of both these possibilities on CMB statistics (and weak lensing observables in particular) is computed. Current data are used to probe these models, forecasts are made for the sensitivity of upcoming efforts like CMB Stage IV and the Simons Array, and a variety of other theoretical considerations are explored., Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies are Gaussian and isotropic at linear order.

Here, I'll discuss a new program developed at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, bringing classes on astrophysics to older adults throughout the city, at retirement homes, at senior center, and at public libraries, bookended by an engaging trip to the Adler Planetarium. In my presentation, I'll present the gerontological and policy motivations for this program, the presenter training techniques, our partner collaboration strategy, and the results of our effort, which engaged hundreds of older adults throughout Chicago from a variety of socioeconomic strata., Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies provide strong evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. They can also test its composition, probing the energy density and particle mass of different dark-matter and dark-energy components. CMB data have already shown that ultra-light axions (ULAs) with mass in the range 10-32 eV→10-26 eV compose a fraction &lt;0.01 of the cosmological critical density. Here, the sensitivity of a proposed CMB-Stage IV (CMB-S4) experiment (assuming a 1 arcmin beam and &lt;1 μK-arcmin noise levels over a sky fraction of 0.4) to the density of ULAs and other dark-sector components is assessed. CMB-S4 data should be ∼10 times more sensitive to the ULA energy-density than Planck data alone, across a wide range of ULA masses 10-32&lt;ma&lt;10-23 eV, and will probe axion decay constants of fa≈1016 GeV, at the grand unified scale. CMB-S4 could improve the CMB lower bound on the ULA mass from ∼10-25 eV to 10-23 eV, nearing the mass range probed by dwarf galaxy abundances and dark-matter halo density profiles. These improvements will allow for a multi-σ detection of percent-level departures from CDM over a wide range of masses. Much of this improvement is driven by the effects of weak gravitational lensing on the CMB, which breaks degeneracies between ULAs and neutrinos. We also find that the addition of ULA parameters does not significantly degrade the sensitivity of the CMB to neutrino masses. These results were obtained using the axionCAMB code (a modification to the CAMB Boltzmann code), presented here for public use., Ultra-light axions emerge from string theory and are attractive dark matter and dark energy candidates. After reviewing the motivation for ultra-light axions, I will discuss the cosmological observables in ultra-light axion cosmological scenarios, and then lay forth the methods and results of a recent search for such axions using CMB anisotropies and the clustering of galaxies, calling on Planck CMB data and the WiggleZ galaxy survey, respectively. I will then explain how isocurvature fluctuations in the CMB lead to an interesting tension between ultra-light axion dark matter and high-scale inflation, leading to interesting connections between the hunt for primordial CMB B-mode polarization and the ultra-light axion hypothesis. I will then survey the range of interesting future observational probes of the ultra-light axion dark matter hypothesis.., Ultra-light axions (ULAs) with masses in the range 10^{-33} eV &lt; m &lt; 10^{-20} eV are motivated by string theory and might contribute to either the dark-matter or dark-energy density of the Universe. ULAs could suppress the growth of structure on small scales, or lead to an enhanced integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect on large-scale cosmic microwave-background (CMB) anisotropies. In this work, cosmological observables over the full ULA mass range are computed, and then used to search for evidence of ULAs using CMB data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Planck satellite, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and South Pole Telescope, as well as galaxy clustering data from the WiggleZ galaxy-redshift survey. In the mass range 10^{-32} eV &lt; m &lt;10^{-25.5} eV, the axion relic-density Ω_{a} (relative to the total dark-matter relic density Ω_{d}) must obey the constraints Ω_{a}/Ω_{d} &lt; 0.05 and Ω_{a}h^{2} &lt; 0.006 at 95%-confidence. For m &gt; 10^{-24} eV, ULAs are indistinguishable from standard cold dark matter on the length scales probed, and are thus allowed by these data. For m &lt; 10^{-32} eV, ULAs are allowed to compose a significant fraction of the dark energy., Primordial isocurvature fluctuations between photons and either neutrinos or nonrelativistic species such as baryons or dark matter are known to be subdominant to adiabatic fluctuations. Perturbations in the relative densities of baryons and dark matter (known as compensated isocurvature perturbations or CIPs), however, are surprisingly poorly constrained. CIPs leave no imprint in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on observable scales, at least at linear order in their amplitude and zeroth order in the amplitude of adiabatic perturbations. It is thus not yet empirically known if baryons trace dark matter at the surface of last scattering. If CIPs exist, they would spatially modulate the Silk damping scale and acoustic horizon, causing distinct fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization power spectra across the sky: this effect is first order in both the CIP and adiabatic mode amplitudes. Here, temperature data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) are used to conduct the first CMB-based observational search for CIPs, using off-diagonal correlations and the CMB trispectrum. Reconstruction noise from weak lensing and point sources is shown to be negligible for this data set. No evidence for CIPs is observed, and a 95% confidence upper limit of 1.1×10<SUP>-2</SUP> is imposed to the amplitude of a scale-invariant CIP power spectrum. This limit agrees with CIP sensitivity forecasts for WMAP and is competitive with smaller-scale constraints from measurements of the baryon fraction in galaxy clusters. It is shown that the root-mean-squared CIP amplitude on 5-100° scales is smaller than ∼0.07-0.17 (depending on the scale) at the 95% confidence level. Temperature data from the Planck satellite will provide an even more sensitive probe for the existence of CIPs, as will the upcoming ACTPol and SPTPol experiments on smaller angular scales., Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies constrain isocurvature fluctuations between photons and nonrelativistic particles to be subdominant to adiabatic fluctuations. Perturbations in the relative number densities of baryons and dark matter, however, are surprisingly poorly constrained. In fact, baryon-density perturbations of fairly large amplitude may exist if they are compensated by dark-matter perturbations, so that the total density remains unchanged. These compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) leave no imprint on the CMB at observable scales, at linear order. B modes in the CMB polarization are generated at reionization through the modulation of the optical depth by CIPs, but this induced polarization is small. The strongest known constraint ≲10% to the CIP amplitude comes from galaxy-cluster baryon fractions. Here, it is shown that modulation of the baryon density by CIPs at and before the decoupling of Thomson scattering at z∼1100 gives rise to CMB effects several orders of magnitude larger than those considered before. Polarization B modes are induced, as are correlations between temperature/polarization spherical-harmonic coefficients of different lm. It is shown that the CIP field at the surface of last scatter can be measured with these off-diagonal correlations. The sensitivity of ongoing and future experiments to these fluctuations is estimated. Data from the WMAP, ACT, SPT, and Spider experiments will be sensitive to fluctuations with amplitude ∼5-10%. The Planck satellite and Polarbear experiment will be sensitive to fluctuations with amplitude ∼3%. SPTPol, ACTPol, and future space-based polarization methods will probe amplitudes as low as ∼0.4%-0.6%. In the cosmic-variance limit, the smallest CIPs that could be detected with the CMB are of amplitude ∼0.05%., Baryon-density perturbations of large amplitude may exist if they are compensated by dark-matter perturbations such that the total density is unchanged. Primordial abundances and galaxy clusters allow these compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) to have amplitudes as large as ∼10%. CIPs will modulate the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations—those due to the usual adiabatic perturbations—as a function of position on the sky. This leads to correlations between different spherical-harmonic coefficients of the temperature and/or polarization maps, and induces polarization B modes. Here, the magnitude of these effects is calculated and techniques to measure them are introduced. While a CIP of this amplitude can be probed on large scales with existing data, forthcoming CMB experiments should improve the sensitivity to CIPs by at least an order of magnitude., Calculations of cosmological hydrogen recombination are vital for the extraction of cosmological parameters from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, and for imposing constraints to inflation and reionization. The Planck mission and future experiments will make high precision measurements of CMB anisotropies at angular scales as small as ℓ∼2500, necessitating a calculation of recombination with fractional accuracy of ≈10<SUP>-3</SUP>. Recent work on recombination includes two-photon transitions from high excitation states and many radiative transfer effects. Modern recombination calculations separately follow angular momentum sublevels of the hydrogen atom to accurately treat nonequilibrium effects at late times (z&lt;900). The inclusion of extremely high-n (n≳100) states of hydrogen is then computationally challenging, preventing until now a determination of the maximum n needed to predict CMB anisotropy spectra with sufficient accuracy for Planck. Here, results from a new multilevel-atom code (RecSparse) are presented. For the first time, “forbidden” quadrupole transitions of hydrogen are included, but shown to be negligible. RecSparse is designed to quickly calculate recombination histories including extremely high-n states in hydrogen. Histories for a sequence of values as high as n<SUB>max⁡</SUB>=250 are computed, keeping track of all angular momentum sublevels and energy shells of the hydrogen atom separately. Use of an insufficiently high n<SUB>max⁡</SUB> value (e.g., n<SUB>max⁡</SUB>=64) leads to errors (e.g., 1.8σ for Planck) in the predicted CMB power spectrum. Extrapolating errors, the resulting CMB anisotropy spectra are converged to ∼0.5σ at Fisher-matrix level for n<SUB>max⁡</SUB>=128, in the purely radiative case., Thanks to the ongoing Planck mission, a new window will be opened on the properties of the primordial density field, the cosmological parameters, and the physics of reionization. Much of Planck's new leverage on these quantities will come from temperature measurements at small angular scales and from polarization measurements. These both depend on the details of cosmological hydrogen recombination; use of the CMB as a probe of energies greater than 10<SUP>16</SUP> GeV compels us to get the eV scale atomic physics right. <P />One question that remains is how high in hydrogen principle quantum number we have to go to make sufficiently accurate predictions for Planck. Using sparse matrix methods to beat computational difficulties, I have modeled the influence of very high (up to and including n=200) excitation states of atomic hydrogen on the recombination history of the primordial plasma, resolving all angular momentum sub-states separately and including, for the first time, the effect of hydrogen quadrupole transitions. I will review the basic physics, explain the resulting plasma properties, discuss recombination histories, and close by discussing the effects on CMB observables., In this thesis, we present four projects featuring low characteristic energy scales relative to the scales relevant for supersymmetric dark matter production or inflation. We present a telescope search for decaying relic axions in the 3 - 8 eV mass range. We utilize larger telescope exposure and superior cluster mass modeling to improve sensitivity. Our results impose new stringent limits to the two-photon coupling or relic density of axions. We extend these results to non-standard sterile neutrinos. <P />We then reconsider cosmological constraints to axions. Our understanding of physics before big-bang nucleosynthesis is tenuous, and after arguing that a non-standard thermal history before nucleosynthesis is plausible and perhaps even natural, we calculate the abundance and typical momenta of thermal axions in such scenarios. We generalize existing cosmological constraints to axions, showing that the allowed axion mass range expands significantly in non-standard thermal histories. We then estimate the sensitivity of future experiments to axion masses and reheating temperatures. <P />We then study the ~ eV-scale physics of cosmological hydrogen ~ 10^4 states of hydrogen up to a maximum n ~ 250, and studying the associated convergence problem. We show that the recombination history is sufficiently converged for analysis of microwave anisotropy data from the Planck satellite if the maximum n ~ 128, and that previously ignored electric quadrupole transitions are indeed negligible to the precision necessary for Planck. <P />We conclude by presenting a new astrophysical limit to effective field theories of gravity in which the graviton propagator is damped at energies greater than a milli-eV., The upcoming Planck launch will require calculating the recombination history of the primordial plasma to considerably higher accuracy than implemented in RECFAST, requiring the inclusion of additional pieces of the relevant atomic physics. In this talk, I will explore the effect on the recombination history of the addition of high-n (n&gt;150) atomic hydrogen states, resolving different angular momentum substates separately., There is no direct evidence for radiation domination prior to big-bang nucleosynthesis, and so it is useful to consider how constraints to thermally-produced axions change in non-standard thermal histories. In the low-temperature-reheating scenario, radiation domination begins as late as ~1 MeV, and is preceded by significant entropy generation. Axion abundances are then suppressed, and cosmological limits to axions are significantly loosened. In a kination scenario, a more modest change to axion constraints occurs. Future possible constraints to axions and low-temperature reheating are discussed., It is usually assumed that dark matter is produced during the radiation-dominated era. There is, however, no direct evidence for radiation domination prior to big-bang nucleosynthesis. Two nonstandard thermal histories are considered. In one, the low-temperature-reheating scenario, radiation domination begins as late as ∼1MeV, and is preceded by significant entropy generation. Thermal axion relic abundances are then suppressed, and cosmological limits to axions are loosened. For reheating temperatures T<SUB>rh</SUB>≲35MeV, the large-scale structure limit to the axion mass is lifted. The remaining constraint from the total density of matter is significantly relaxed. Constraints are also relaxed for higher reheating temperatures. In a kination scenario, a more modest change to cosmological axion constraints is obtained. Future possible constraints to axions and low-temperature reheating from the helium abundance and next-generation large-scale-structure surveys are discussed., A search for optical line emission from the two-photon decay of relic axions was conducted in the galaxy clusters Abell 2667 and 2390, using spectra from the VIMOS (Visible MultiObject Spectrograph) integral field unit at the Very Large Telescope. New upper limits to the two-photon coupling of the axion are derived, and are at least a factor of 3 more stringent than previous upper limits in this mass window. The improvement follows from a larger collecting area, integration time, and spatial resolution, as well as from improvements in signal to noise and sky subtraction made possible by strong-lensing mass models of these clusters. The new limits either require that the two-photon coupling of the axion be extremely weak or that the axion mass window between 4.5 eV and 7.7 eV be closed. Implications for sterile-neutrino dark matter are discussed briefly also.","['2023APS..APRH14007G', 'ascl:2203.026', '2022ascl.soft03026G', '2020AAS...23523503G', '2019AAS...23422303G', '2019arXiv190409003G', '2019BAAS...51c.567G', '10.48550/arXiv.1904.09003', 'arXiv:1904.09003', '2019astro2020T.567G', '2019AAS...23336203G', '2019AAS...23314203G', '2017AAS...22941105G', '2017AAS...22932304G', '2015IAUGA..2243663G', '2015AAS...22544302G', '2014PhRvD..89b3006G', '10.48550/arXiv.1306.4319', '10.1103/PhysRevD.89.023006', 'arXiv:1306.4319', '2013arXiv1306.4319G', '10.1103/PhysRevD.84.123003', '2011PhRvD..84l3003G', '2011arXiv1107.5047G', 'arXiv:1107.5047', '10.48550/arXiv.1107.5047', '2011PhRvL.107z1301G', '10.48550/arXiv.1107.1716', '2011arXiv1107.1716G', '10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.261301', 'arXiv:1107.1716', '2009arXiv0911.1359G', '10.1103/PhysRevD.81.083005', 'arXiv:0911.1359', '2010PhRvD..81h3005G', '10.48550/arXiv.0911.1359', '2010BAAS...42R.550G', '2010AAS...21536206G', '2010PhDT.......226G', '2009AAS...21348006G', '10.1063/1.3232168', '2008arXiv0812.4721G', '10.48550/arXiv.0812.4721', 'arXiv:0812.4721', '2009AIPC.1166..119G', 'arXiv:0711.1352', '2007arXiv0711.1352G', '10.1103/PhysRevD.77.085020', '10.48550/arXiv.0711.1352', '2008PhRvD..77h5020G', '2006astro.ph.11502G', '10.48550/arXiv.astro-ph/0611502', '2007PhRvD..75j5018G', 'arXiv:astro-ph/0611502', '10.1103/PhysRevD.75.105018']","[('cmb', 61), ('dark', 35), ('matter', 31), ('scale', 30), ('density', 23), ('axions', 22), ('data', 20), ('mass', 19), ('ev', 19), ('cosmological', 18)]","[(('dark', 'matter'), 28), (('ultra', 'light'), 12), (('background', 'cmb'), 12), (('cmb', 'anisotropy'), 10), (('cosmic', 'microwave'), 10), (('microwave', 'background'), 10), (('light', 'axions'), 8), (('mass', 'range'), 8), (('power', 'spectrum'), 7), (('dark', 'energy'), 6)]","[(('cosmic', 'microwave', 'background'), 10), (('microwave', 'background', 'cmb'), 10), (('ultra', 'light', 'axions'), 8), (('background', 'cmb', 'anisotropies'), 5), (('compensated', 'isocurvature', 'perturbations'), 5), (('fine', 'structure', 'constant'), 4), (('light', 'axions', 'ulas'), 4), (('gravitational', 'lensing', 'cmb'), 4), (('large', 'scale', 'structure'), 4), (('cold', 'dark', 'matter'), 4)]",Dirty

We investigate the relationship between star formation and gas content in late interaction phase merger Arp 299 from VIXENS. By comparing Hα, Paα, and 24μm images to CO(2→1), CO(3→2), HCN(1→0), HCO+(1→0), and HI maps, we explore the relation between the star formation rate and gas surface densities on spatially resolved ~kpc scales. We find that the SFR-gas relations for Arp 299 are discrepant from known extragalactic spatially resolved relations in nearby spiral galaxies and disk-averaged relations in high-z mergers., We present an HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J=3\to 2 survey of Class 0+I and Flat SED young stellar objects (YSOs) found in the Gould Belt clouds by surveys with Spitzer. Our goal is to provide a uniform Stage 0+I source indicator for these embedded protostar candidates. We made single point HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J=3\to 2 measurements toward the source positions at the CSO and APEX of 546 YSOs (89% of the Class 0+I + Flat SED sample). Using the criteria from van Kempen et al., we classify sources as Stage 0+I or bona fide protostars and find that 84% of detected sources meet the criteria. We recommend a timescale for the evolution of Stage 0+I (embedded protostars) of 0.54 Myr. We find significant correlations of HCO<SUP>+</SUP> integrated intensity with α and T<SUB>bol</SUB> but not with L<SUB>bol</SUB>. The detection fraction increases smoothly as a function of α and L<SUB>bol</SUB>, while decreasing smoothly with T<SUB>bol</SUB>. Using the Stage 0+I sources tightens the relation between protostars and high extinction regions of the cloud; 89% of Stage I sources lie in regions with A<SUB>V</SUB> &gt; 8 mag. Class 0+I and Flat SED YSOs that are not detected in HCO<SUP>+</SUP> have, on average, a factor of ∼2 higher T<SUB>bol</SUB> and a factor of ∼5 lower L<SUB>bol</SUB> than YSOs with HCO<SUP>+</SUP> detections. We find less YSO contamination, defined as the number of undetected YSOs divided by the total number surveyed, for sources with T<SUB>bol</SUB> ≲ 600 K and L<SUB>bol</SUB> ≳ 1 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The contamination percentage is &gt;90% at A<SUB>V</SUB> &lt; 4 mag and decreases as A<SUB>V</SUB> increases., We present the results of the the MIsidentified YSOs from SED Fits (MISFITS) HCO+ Survey of Class I and Flat SED sources in the Spitzer Gould Belt nearby (d &lt; 500 pc) cloud surveys. Our goal is to provide a uniform indicator of whether or not these sources are likely to be Stage I protostars. Using this new sample of Stage I protostars, we discuss the interrelationship between their spatial distribution, cloud structure properties, star formation and gas density in the Solar Neighborhood., We investigate the relationship between star formation and gas content in late interaction phase merger Arp 299 from the VIRUS-P Investigation of the eXtreme ENvironments of Starbursts (VIXENS) integral field unit survey. By comparing H-alpha, Pa-alpha and 24um data to CO(1-0), CO(2-1), HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and HI maps, we explore the relation between the star formation rate and gas surface densities on spatially resolved ~kpc scales. We find discrepancies from known extragalactic spatially resolved relations in nearby spiral galaxies and disk-averaged relations in high-z mergers., In this thesis, I explore the rate at which molecular gas is converted to stars through detailed studies of a sample of molecular clouds in the Milky Way, IFU spatially resolved observations of gas-rich nearby interacting galaxies, as well as the environmental dependence of star formation and galaxy morphology in a galaxy supercluster. This thesis is composed of three individual projects that investigate nearby star formation within the local 500 pc of our Sun, to neighboring extreme star forming environments of interacting starburst galaxies, and finally studying how star formation varies with galaxy morphology in a galaxy supercluster a z 0.165. I discuss the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and molecular gas surface densities (e.g., Schmidt-Kennicutt relation) in Galactic star forming regions and find there is a discrepancy between my study and extragalactic relations. The discrepancy is attributed to extragalactic measurements that are averaged over large &gt;kpc scales and include star forming molecular gas (above some threshold) and molecular gas the is not dense enough to form stars. I find a steep increase in the Galactic SFR-gas surface density relation indicative of a threshold for efficient star formation that is best fit to a broken power law with a linear slope above 129 Msun pc<SUP>-2</SUP>. I introduce the VIRUS-P Investigation of the eXtreme ENviroments of Starbursts (VIXENS) project which is a survey of interacting is a large integral field unit survey of nearby infrared bright (L_IR&gt;3x10<SUP>10</SUP> Lsun) interacting/starburst galaxies. The main goal of VIXENS is to investigate the relation between star formation and gas content on spatially resolved scales of 0.1-1 kpc in the extreme star forming environments of interacting/starburst galaxies. The VIXENS sample is composed of systems in a range interaction stages with morphological signatures from early phase (close pairs) to late stage mergers (single system with multiple nuclei), SFRs, and gas surface densities. I highlight the first results from the VIXENS survey in the late interaction phase galaxy merger Arp 299. I find 1.3 kpc regions in Arp 299 to lie along the SFR-gas surface density relation found for mergers at high redshift, but this relation is highly dependent on the CO to molecular hydrogen (Hz) conversion factor. I find evidence for a Galactic CO-to-Hz conversion factor using metallicity and dust temperature measurements, which would place 1.3 kpc regions in the Arp 299 merger in between the high redshift and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. Comparing the SFR to dense gas surface densities as traced by HCN and HCO+, I find an agreement between the spatially resolved measurements and that found on global scales in spirals and (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies. Finally, I present an investigation of the influence of environment on frequency, distribution, color, and star formation properties of galaxy mergers and non-interacting galaxies in the Abell 901/902 supercluster at z 0.165. I find galaxy mergers be preferentially blue in color and have an enhanced SFR by a factor of 2 compared to non-interacting galaxies. This result may be due to a decrease in galaxy velocity dispersion in the cluster outskirt, favoring galaxy-galaxy interactions, or to interacting galaxies that are part of groups or field galaxies being accreted along cosmological filaments by the clusters. I compare to N-body simulations of groups and field galaxies accreting onto the clusters and find the fraction of mergers are similar to that predicated at group overdensities. I find the SFR of galaxies in the supercluster to be depressed compared to field galaxies in both the core and cluster outskirts, suggesting that an environmental process such as ram pressure stripping is effective throughout the cluster. The results of a modest SFR enhancement and a low merger fraction culminate in my finding that mergers contribute only a small fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total SFR density of the Abell 901/902 clusters., We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities in Galactic star forming regions and integral field unit (IFU) spatially resolved regions in nearby interacting/starburst galaxies. Our Galactic study uses a sample of 20 molecular clouds from the Spitzer c2d and Gould's Belt surveys. These data allow us to probe the low mass star formation regime that is essentially invisible to tracers (such as H-alpha emission) used to establish extragalactic relations (eg., Schmidt-Kennicutt relation). We find Galactic clouds above a threshold of 129 Msun/pc<SUP>2</SUP> lie on a linear relation above extragalactic relations. Our extragalactic IFU survey is the VIRUS-P Investigation of the eXtreme ENvironments of Starbursts (VIXENS) which includes 15 nearby interacting/starburst galaxies that span a range of interaction phases: from close pairs to late stage mergers. The main goal of VIXENS is to investigate the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation on spatial scales of 0.1-0.9 kpc and test theoretical predictions at high SFR and gas surface densities in starburst galaxies. If a starburst CO-to-H2 conversion factor is used, we find sub-kpc scale starburst regions lie above extragalactic relations, overlapping with global measurements of high-z mergers as well as Galactic star forming regions. The overlap with Galactic star forming regions suggests that the bulk of gas in mergers is efficiently forming stars. These unique data sets allow us to compare SFR-gas surface density relations from Galactic clouds to extreme starbursts on spatially resolved scales for the first time., , We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities in Galactic star forming regions using a sample of YSOs and massive clumps. Our YSO sample consists of objects located in 20 molecular clouds from the Spitzer c2d and Gould's Belt surveys. We estimate the gas surface density (Sigma_gas) from Av maps and YSO SFR surface densities (Sigma_SFR) from the number of YSOs, assuming a mean mass and lifetime. We also divide the clouds into contour levels of Av, counting only the youngest Class I and Flat SED YSOs. For a sample of massive star forming clumps, we derive SFRs from the infrared luminosity and use HCN gas maps to estimate Sigma_gas. We find that Galactic clouds lie above the extragalactic relations (e.g., Kennicutt-Schmidt Law) by factors up to 17. Cloud regions with high Sigma_gas lie above extragalactic relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with massive clumps. We use 12CO and 13CO gas maps of the Perseus and Ophiuchus clouds to estimate Sigma_gas and compare to Sigma_gas from Av maps. We find that 13CO, underestimates the Av-based mass by factors of 4-5. 12CO may underestimate the total gas mass at Sigma_gas &gt; 200 Msun pc^-2 by &gt; 30%; however, this does not explain the large discrepancy between Galactic and extragalactic relations. We find evidence for a threshold of star formation (Sigma_th) at 129+-14 Msun pc^-2. At Sigma_gas &gt; Sigma_th, the Galactic relation is linear. A possible reason for the difference between Galactic and extragalactic relations is that all the CO-emitting gas, including Sigma_gas below Sigma_th, is measured in extragalactic studies. If the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Sigma_SFR Sigma_gas^1.4) and a linear relation between dense gas and star formation is assumed, the fraction of dense gas (f_dense) increases as Sigma_gas^0.4. When Sigma_gas reaches 300Sigma_th, f_dense is 1., We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities in Galactic star-forming regions using a sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) and massive dense clumps. Our YSO sample consists of objects located in 20 large molecular clouds from the Spitzer cores to disks (c2d) and Gould's Belt (GB) surveys. These data allow us to probe the regime of low-mass star formation, essentially invisible to tracers of high-mass star formation used to establish extragalactic SFR-gas relations. We estimate the gas surface density (Σ<SUB>gas</SUB>) from extinction (A<SUB>V</SUB> ) maps and YSO SFR surface densities (Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>) from the number of YSOs, assuming a mean mass and lifetime. We also divide the clouds into evenly spaced contour levels of A<SUB>V</SUB> , counting only Class I and Flat spectral energy distribution YSOs, which have not yet migrated from their birthplace. For a sample of massive star-forming clumps, we derive SFRs from the total infrared luminosity and use HCN gas maps to estimate gas surface densities. We find that c2d and GB clouds lie above the extragalactic SFR-gas relations (e.g., Kennicutt-Schmidt law) by factors of up to 17. Cloud regions with high Σ<SUB>gas</SUB> lie above extragalactic relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with high-mass star-forming regions. We use <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO gas maps of the Perseus and Ophiuchus clouds from the COMPLETE survey to estimate gas surface densities and compare to measurements from A<SUB>V</SUB> maps. We find that <SUP>13</SUP>CO, with the standard conversions to total gas, underestimates the A<SUB>V</SUB> -based mass by factors of ~4-5. <SUP>12</SUP>CO may underestimate the total gas mass at Σ<SUB>gas</SUB> &gt;~ 200 M <SUB>sun</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP> by gsim30%; however, this small difference in mass estimates does not explain the large discrepancy between Galactic and extragalactic relations. We find evidence for a threshold of star formation (Σ<SUB>th</SUB>) at 129 ± 14 M <SUB>sun</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP>. At Σ<SUB>gas</SUB>&gt;Σ<SUB>th</SUB>, the Galactic SFR-gas relation is linear. A possible reason for the difference between Galactic and extragalactic relations is that much of Σ<SUB>gas</SUB> is below Σ<SUB>th</SUB> in extragalactic studies, which detect all the CO-emitting gas. If the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB> vprop Σ<SUP>1.4</SUP> <SUB>gas</SUB>) and a linear relation between dense gas and star formation are assumed, the fraction of dense star-forming gas (f <SUB>dense</SUB>) increases as ~Σ<SUP>0.4</SUP> <SUB>gas</SUB>. When Σ<SUB>gas</SUB> reaches ~300 Σ<SUB>th</SUB>, the fraction of dense gas is ~1, creating a maximal starburst., , We investigate galaxy mergers in the A901/902 supercluster at z ∼ 0.165, based on HST ACS F606W, COMBO-17, Spitzer 24 μm, XMM-Newton X-ray, and gravitational lensing maps, as part of the STAGES survey. We utilize two methods to identify interacting galaxies in A901/902: visual classification and quantitative CAS parameters. In this article, we summarize our results for the frequency, distribution, color, and star formation rates of mergers, compared to non-interacting galaxies in A901/902. We also compare our results to other studies of clusters and groups, as well as theoretical predictions., We present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in the Abell 901/902 supercluster at z~ 0.165, based on 893 bright (R <SUB>Vega</SUB>&lt;= 24) intermediate-mass (M <SUB>*</SUB> &gt;= 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>) galaxies. We use HST ACS F606W data from the Space Telescope A901/902 Galaxy Evolution Survey, COMBO-17, Spitzer 24 μm, and XMM-Newton X-ray data. Our analysis utilizes both a physically driven visual classification system and quantitative CAS parameters to identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of mass ratio &gt;1/10 (i.e., major and minor mergers). Our results are (1) after visual classification and minimizing the contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fraction f <SUB>merge</SUB> is 0.023 ± 0.007. The estimated fractions of likely major mergers, likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01 ± 0.004, 0.006 ± 0.003, and 0.007 ± 0.003, respectively. (2) All the mergers lie outside the cluster core of radius R&lt; 0.25 Mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the large galaxy velocity dispersion in the core. The mergers, instead, populate the region (0.25 Mpc &lt;R&lt;= 2 Mpc) between the core and the cluster outskirt. In this region, the estimated frequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities in N-body simulations of accreting groups in the A901/902 clusters. This suggests the ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and field galaxies. (3) We compare our observed merger fraction with those reported in other clusters and groups out to z~ 0.4. Existing data points on the merger fraction for L &lt;= L* galaxies in clusters allow for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from no evolution to evolution by a factor of ~5 over z~ 0.17-0.4. (4) In A901/902, the fraction of interacting galaxies, which lie on the blue cloud is 80% ± 18% (16/20) versus 34% ± 7% or (294/866) for non-interacting galaxies, implying that interacting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) The average star formation rate (SFR), based on UV or a combination of UV+IR data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5-2 in mergers compared to non-interacting galaxies. However, mergers in the A901/902 clusters contribute only a small fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total SFR density, while the rest of the SFR density comes from non-interacting galaxies., We present a study of galaxies in the STAGES survey of the Abell 901/902 supercluster at z∼0.165, based on HST/ACS F606W, COMBO-17, Spitzer 24 μm, XMM-Newton X-ray, and gravitational lensing maps. We characterize galaxies with strong, externally-triggered morphological distortions and normal, relatively undisturbed galaxies, using visual classification and quantitative CAS parameters. We compare normal and distorted galaxies in terms of their frequency, distribution within the cluster, star formation properties, and relationship to dark matter or surface mass density, and intra-cluster medium density. We report here our preliminary results., We present a study of galaxies in the Abell 901/902 Supercluster at z∼0.165, based on HST ACS F606W, COMBO-17, Spitzer 24 μm, XMM-Newton X-ray, and gravitational lensing maps, as part of the STAGES survey. We characterize galaxies with strong externally-triggered morphological distortions and normal relatively undisturbed galaxies, using visual classification and quantitative CAS parameters. We compare normal and distorted galaxies in terms of their frequency, distribution within the cluster, star formation properties, and relationship to dark matter (DM) or surface mass density, and intra-cluster medium (ICM) density. We revisit the morphology density relation, which postulates a higher fraction of early type galaxies in dense environments, by considering separately galaxies with a low bulge-to-disk (B/D) ratio and a low gas content as these two parameters may not be correlated in clusters. We report here on our preliminary analysis., The cluster environment is host to an array of processes such as galaxy-galaxy interactions and ram pressure stripping, which can dramatically influence the evolution of galaxies. In order to constrain the frequency of these environmental processes and their consequences, we analyze the morphological properties of galaxies in the Abell 901/902 Supercluster at z=0.17. As part of the STAGES (Space Telescope Abell 901/902 Galaxy Evolution Survey) collaboration, we have a panoramic multi-wavelength dataset that includes HST ACS F606W, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, and GALEX images, as well as XMM-Newton x-ray, and gravitational lensing maps. We characterize morphologically disturbed and normal undisturbed galaxies using quantitative CAS parameters and a multi-parameter visual classification system. We present comparisons of the star formation and AGN activity in interacting versus normal galaxies. We also compare normal and interacting systems as a function of cluster properties including cluster radius, galaxy number density, dark matter distribution, intracluster medium density, and other measures of environment. We explore the distribution of gas-rich and gas-poor galaxies, as well as those of major and minor merger candidates in the core and outskirts of the cluster. We compare the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR of normal and interacting galaxies in cluster and field environments. This work will afford important insights on how the environment shapes the evolution of cluster galaxies. <P />Financial support was provided by NSF grant AST-0607748, LTSA grant NAG5-13063, and HST-GO-10861 and HST-GO-10395 from STScI, which is operated by AURA, Inc., for NASA, under NAS5-26555., Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) provide a unique environment to study the role of gas in galaxy evolution. We use new Spitzer IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns) and MIPS (24 micron) data in combination with archival VLA HI observations to examine star formation and HI gas content in HCG 07 and HCG 19. The HI observations show that gas is confined to the individual galaxies, which are HI deficient compared to isolated galaxies. The gas kinematics are fairly regular, indicating that these systems are at an early stage of the proposed evolutionary scenario for compact groups. We examine the relationship between the HI deficiency and the infrared spectral energy distributions of the individual galaxies to help understand how the cold gas content and star formation activity evolve in compact groups., To study the rate at which stars form in distant galaxies and the connection between this and their properties, a detailed analysis of data from the DEEP2 Redshift Survey is being performed. DEEP2 is studying a sample of 60,000 distant galaxies, 6-8 billion light years away, using DEIMOS, an instrument at the Keck II telescope. The amount of star formation in these galaxies is being investigated by measuring the equivalent width (EW) of [OII], or the amount of light emitted by ionized oxygen. Based on galaxies in the nearby Universe, correlations are expected to be found between the equivalent width values and the brightness of galaxies. Since DEEP2 is looking a distant galaxies, this is only a hypothesis, and conclusions will be established from the measured [OII] EW's. A similar trend is that nearby galaxies in dense clusters tend to have stopped star formation, while galaxies in less dense regions have higher oxygen equivalent widths and contain young stars. Further analysis of the DEEP2 data may lead to a better understanding of evolution and distribution of galaxies in the universe.","['2016rffe.confE..10H', '2016AAS...22734606H', '10.1017/S1743921316007948', '2016IAUS..315E..33H', '2015IAUGA..2257424H', '2015IAUGA..2257820H', '2015IAUGA..2257813H', '2015ApJ...806..231H', '2015arXiv150306810H', '10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/231', 'arXiv:1503.06810', '10.48550/arXiv.1503.06810', '2015AAS...22521101H', '2014AAS...22311703H', '2012PhDT.......339H', '2012AAS...21920803H', '2011nha..confE..29H', '10.22323/1.149.0029', '2011PoS...149E..29H', '2011AAS...21743443H', '2011BAAS...4343443H', '2010arXiv1009.1621H', 'arXiv:1009.1621', '10.1088/0004-637X/723/2/1019', '10.48550/arXiv.1009.1621', '2010ApJ...723.1019H', '2010fsgc.confE.116H', '2009ASPC..419..257H', '2009ApJ...705.1433H', 'arXiv:0910.5718', '2009arXiv0910.5718H', '10.1088/0004-637X/705/2/1433', '10.48550/arXiv.0910.5718', 'arXiv:0802.3886', '10.48550/arXiv.0802.3886', '2008ASPC..396..269H', '2008arXiv0802.3886H', '2008arXiv0802.3908H', '2008ASPC..393..211H', '10.48550/arXiv.0802.3908', 'arXiv:0802.3908', '2007AAS...211.9613H', '2007BAAS...39Q.902H', '2005AAS...20717916H', '2005BAAS...37R1456H', '2003BAAS...35Q1405H', '2003AAS...20311904H']","[('galaxy', 79), ('gas', 77), ('star', 57), ('relation', 44), ('merger', 37), ('formation', 35), ('density', 29), ('survey', 28), ('sfr', 28), ('cluster', 26)]","[(('star', 'formation'), 35), (('surface', 'density'), 18), (('gas', 'surface'), 16), (('star', 'forming'), 15), (('interacting', 'galaxy'), 14), (('dense', 'gas'), 12), (('sfr', 'gas'), 11), (('extragalactic', 'relation'), 11), (('sigma', 'gas'), 11), (('relation', 'star'), 9)]","[(('gas', 'surface', 'densities'), 11), (('star', 'forming', 'regions'), 8), (('star', 'formation', 'rate'), 8), (('galactic', 'star', 'forming'), 7), (('class', 'flat', 'sed'), 7), (('relation', 'star', 'formation'), 7), (('sfr', 'gas', 'surface'), 7), (('formation', 'rate', 'sfr'), 6), (('virus', 'investigation', 'extreme'), 5), (('star', 'formation', 'gas'), 5)]",Dirty

The core functionality is achieved via the ""lunarsky"" package, which acts as an extension to astropy and provides selenocentric and topocentric lunar frames, as well as transformations to all other astropy-supported coordinate frames. We have integrated lunarsky into the Radio Astronomy Software Group codes ""pyuvdata"", ""pyradiosky"", and ""pyuvsim"". The latter is of particular importance, as it allows the generation of mock visibility data sets (i.e. mock observations) at ultra-high precision, which we use to test and develop 21 cm cosmology analysis packages. We are also integrating ""lunarsky"" into the ""21cmSense' package, which allows sensitivity forecasting for 21 cm dark ages experiments on the lunar far side., Observations of the highly-redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen are one of the last frontiers in cosmology. Vast volumes of the observable Universe can be probed via this technique, including redshifts higher than ~ 30 (i.e. prior to the formation of the first stars). At these very high redshifts, the hydrogen traces the cosmic density field, ultimately promising orders of magnitude more information than could ever be extracted from the Cosmic Microwave Background. However, at these high redshifts the restframe 21 cm signal has shifted to very long radio wavelengths, emission that is blocked by the Earth's ionosphere. Accessing this cosmological treasure trove requires spacebased observations. At moderately high redshifts (e.g. z ~ 7), the hydrogen signal can still be observed from the ground, and multiple experiments are underway targeting a first detection. These experiments have taught the community many lessons about the challenges of this technique: foreground radio emission swamps the 21 cm signal by 5 orders of magnitude. The foregrounds can, in principle, be separated based on their spectral behavior, but the radio telescope must be modeled with extremely high precision to enable such techniques. The challenge is even greater for space-based missions. At the highest redshifts, the foregrounds can exceed the 21 cm signal by as much as 8 or 9 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the mapping between radio frequency and cosmological redshift has moved to a fundamentally different regime. For instance, a 1 MHz radio-frequency bandwidth centered at 30 MHz (z ~ 45 in the 21 cm line) spans a redshift range almost forty times larger than a 1 MHz bandwidth centered at 180 MHz (z ~ 7). The repercussions of this fact are significant: frequency structure introduced by the instrument contaminates many more modes of the 21 cm signal at high redshifts than at low. Because of this relationship, the preferred ground-based technique of ""foreground avoidance"" (where only modes of the 21 cm signal that cleanly separate from the foreground emission are used to make cosmological constraints) cannot be used at high redshifts. Techniques focused on ""foreground subtraction"" must be employed for a space-based neutral hydrogen cosmology experiment to be successful. PI Pober's previous APRA award (""A Science-Driven Performance Specification Framework for Space-Based Neutral Hydrogen Cosmology Experiments"") developed software to simulate mock data for space-based radio telescopes and enable design studies and planning for optimal observing strategies. This software – pyuvsim – provides ultra-precise, fully polarized, horizon-to-horizon simulations, which ultimately are necessary to capture all the subtleties in extracting a 1-part-in-108 signal. This successor proposal aims to use pyuvsim to aid in the development of foreground removal algorithms for space-based missions. The final products of this research will be two-fold: (1) an updated version of the publicly-available 21 cm cosmology package FHD (""Fast Holographic Deconvolution"") which has been demonstrated to successfully remove foreground emission and recover the 21 cm signal from pyuvsim simulations of spacebased neutral hydrogen cosmology missions; and (2) a suite of publicly-available pyuvsim simulations exploring a range of space-based neutral hydrogen cosmology mission concepts that can enable ""data challenges"" and other technique development for these experiments. Having this software in-hand will maximize the impact of spacebased low-frequency radio astronomy instruments that can serve as pathfinders for future 21 cm cosmology focused missions., The idea of redundant calibration has a long history in radio interferometry, but has drawn renewed attention over the last several years for its potential to mitigate systematics in 21 cm cosmology experiments. In this talk, I will show results from both simulations and the analysis of real data that demonstrate the limitations inherent to redundant calibration. In particular, many of the frequency-dependent calibration errors that plague 21 cm cosmology cannot be mitigated by redundant calibration. Without alternative methods, ""traditional"" sky-based calibration schemes remain an essential part of a 21 cm cosmology analysis pipeline - and the challenges associated with sky-based calibration must continue to be addressed., In this talk, I will highlight the projects led by the newly established Radio Astronomy Software Group: pyuvdata and pyuvsim. The goal of these projects is to support radio astronomers, particularly those in the field of 21 cm cosmology, as they work to vet their analysis pipelines. pyuvdata provides seamless support for a number of common radio astronomy data formats, with work underway to enable similar functionality for beam and telescope models, calibration solutions, and radio source catalogs. pyuvsim is a massively parallelized ""brute force"" interferometric simulation suite, aimed at providing robust, high fidelity simulations for end-to-end testing of analysis pipelines. Taken together, these software advances can provide a new level of reliability and reproducibility for the field of 21 cm cosmology and other radio astronomy experiments facing stringent calibration and analysis challenges., Observations of the highly-redshifted 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen (HI) are one of the most promising probes for the future of cosmology. At redshifts z &gt; 30, the HI signal is likely the only measurable emission, as luminous objects have yet to form. At these very low radio frequencies, however, the earth’s ionosphere becomes opaque — necessitating observations from space. The major challenge to neutral hydrogen cosmology (at all redshifts) lies in the presence of bright foreground emission, which can dominate the HI signal by as much as eight orders of magnitude at the highest redshifts. The only method for extracting the cosmological signal relies on the spectral smoothness of the foregrounds; since each frequency of the HI signal probes a different redshift, the cosmological emission is essentially uncorrelated from frequency to frequency. The key challenge for designing an experiment lies in maintaining the spectral smoothness of the foregrounds. If the frequency response of the instrument introduces spectral structure (or at least, a residual that cannot be calibrated out at the necessary precision), it quickly becomes impossible to distinguish the cosmological signal from the foregrounds. This principle has guided the design of ground-based experiments like the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). However, there still exists no unifying framework for turning this design ""philosophy"" into a robust, quantitative set of performance metrics and specifications. In this talk, I will present updates on the efforts of my research group to translate lessons learned from ground-based experiments into a fully traceable set of mission requirements for Cosmic Dawn Mapper or other space-based 21 cm interferometer., The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) was a first-generation 21 cm cosmology experiment with the specific goal of detecting the power spectrum of the 21 cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization. Analysis of PAPER data is still ongoing, but lessons learned from PAPER to date have played a critical role in designing the next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment. This article reviews five key design choices made by PAPER: use of a non-imaging configuration, redundancy, short baselines, small antenna elements, and a large instantaneous bandwidth. We describe the impact of these choices and the role they played in designing HERA., The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a dedicated experiment to detect the highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen from the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization. When complete, HERA will consist of 350 14 meter dishes, giving it unprecedented sensitivity to the 21 cm signal from reionization. The experiment recently completed a commissioning phase with 19 dishes and has begun its first deep science campaign observations with 37+ dishes. In this talk, I will present results from our commissioning phase and provide an update on the growth of the experiment going forward., 21 cm cosmologists seek a measurement of the hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen from very high redshifts. While this signal has the potential to provide an unprecedented view into the early universe, it is also buried under exceedingly bright foreground emission. Over the last several years, 21 cm cosmology research has led to an improved understanding of how low frequency radio interferometers will affect the separation of cosmological signal from foregrounds. This talk will describe new efforts to incorporate this understanding into simulations of the most realistic data sets for the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). These high fidelity simulations are essential for robust algorithm design and validation of early results from these experiments., We present upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum at z = 5.9 calculated from the model-independent limit on the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium of x_{H I} &lt; 0.06 + 0.05 (1σ ) derived from dark pixel statistics of quasar absorption spectra. Using 21CMMC, a Markov chain Monte Carlo Epoch of Reionization analysis code, we explore the probability distribution of 21 cm power spectra consistent with this constraint on the neutral fraction. We present 99 per cent confidence upper limits of Δ<SUP>2</SUP>(k) &lt; 10-20 mK<SUP>2</SUP> over a range of k from 0.5 to 2.0 h Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, with the exact limit dependent on the sampled k mode. This limit can be used as a null test for 21 cm experiments: a detection of power at z = 5.9 in excess of this value is highly suggestive of residual foreground contamination or other systematic errors affecting the analysis., 21cmSense calculates the expected sensitivities of 21cm experiments to the Epoch of Reionization power spectrum. Written in Python, it requires NumPy, SciPy, and AIPY (ascl:1609.012)., In this paper we present observations, simulations, and analysis demonstrating the direct connection between the location of foreground emission on the sky and its location in cosmological power spectra from interferometric redshifted 21 cm experiments. We begin with a heuristic formalism for understanding the mapping of sky coordinates into the cylindrically averaged power spectra measurements used by 21 cm experiments, with a focus on the effects of the instrument beam response and the associated sidelobes. We then demonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and observed data from the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that removing a foreground model that includes sources in both the main field of view and the first sidelobes reduces the contamination in high k<SUB>∥</SUB> modes by several per cent relative to a model that only includes sources in the main field of view, with the completeness of the foreground model setting the principal limitation on the amount of power removed. While small, a percent-level amount of foreground power is in itself more than enough to prevent recovery of any Epoch of Reionization signal from these modes. This result demonstrates that foreground subtraction for redshifted 21 cm experiments is truly a wide-field problem, and algorithms and simulations must extend beyond the instrument’s main field of view to potentially recover the full 21 cm power spectrum., Experiments Observations of the highly-redshifted 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen (HI) are one of the most promising probes for the future of cosmology. In principle, once the spin temperature of cosmic hydrogen decouples from the Cosmic Microwave Background at z ∼ 200, all neutral hydrogen at lower redshifts becomes visible through its hyperfine line emission. Observations at meter wavelength probe the state of HI in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization, offering insight into the nature of the first stars and galaxies — a key component of NASA’s Cosmic Origins Program. By pushing observations to higher redshifts (and therefore longer wavelengths), the HI signal becomes the only measurable emission, as luminous objects have yet to form. Observations of these cosmic “dark ages” can offer unprecedented insight into the primordial spectrum of density perturbations and the very nature of inflation, answering questions at the heart of NASA’s Physics of the Cosmos Program. At these very low radio frequencies, however, the earth’s ionosphere becomes opaque — necessitating observations from space. NASA’s “Enduring Quests, Daring Visions” Astrophysics Roadmap recognized the great promise of these observations, and proposed the visionary Cosmic Dawn Mapper — an array of thousands of radio antennas on the far side of the moon — to conduct them. However, the major challenge to neutral hydrogen cosmology (at all redshifts) lies in the presence of bright foreground emission, which can dominate the HI signal by as much as eight orders of magnitude during the dark ages. The only method for extracting the cosmological signal relies on the spectral smoothness of the foregrounds; since each frequency of the HI signal probes a different redshift, the cosmological emission is essentially uncorrelated from frequency to frequency. The key challenge for designing an experiment lies in maintaining the spectral smoothness of the foregrounds. If the frequency response of the instrument introduces spectral structure (or at least, a residual that cannot be calibrated out at the necessary precision), it quickly becomes impossible to distinguish the cosmological signal from the foregrounds. This principle has guided the design of ground-based experiments like the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). However, there still exists no unifying framework for turning this design philosophy into a robust, quantitative set of performance metrics and specifications. The goal of this proposal is to develop technology that can directly determine the impact of system design on the science deliverables: measurements of the HI power spectrum and, in turn, constraints on cosmological and astrophysical parameters. This technology will consist of a software suite for end-to-end simulation of the entire instrument and pipeline: encompassing aspects from antenna design, to sources of systematic errors like mutual coupling of elements and cross-talk, through to the analysis tools used. My research group has experience at the forefront of all these aspects of HI cosmology experiments; the work to be proposed here focuses on unifying our most advanced understanding of these issues into one framework. This is far from a trivial task, and requires end-to-end instrument simulations with a level of precision never before achieved with low-frequency radio astronomy instrumentation. However, this framework is absolutely necessary for designing any future mission (especially one in space). Science traceability is a fundamental component of mission design, and, at present, HI cosmology experiments cannot connect mission and instrument requirements and specifications directly to the science goals. The work we will propose is therefore mission enabling in the most basic sense: without it, one cannot define the metrics upon which an experiment can be judged., We present constraints on both the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z = 8.4, and on models for heating the IGM at high-redshift with X-ray emission from the first collapsed objects. These constraints are derived using a semi-analytic method to explore the new measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum from the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), which were presented in a companion paper, Ali et al. Twenty-one cm power spectra with amplitudes of hundreds of mK<SUP>2</SUP> can be generically produced if the kinetic temperature of the IGM is significantly below the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB); as such, the new results from PAPER place lower limits on the IGM temperature at z = 8.4. Allowing for the unknown ionization state of the IGM, our measurements find the IGM temperature to be above ≈5 K for neutral fractions between 10% and 85%, above ≈7 K for neutral fractions between 15% and 80%, or above ≈10 K for neutral fractions between 30% and 70%. We also calculate the heating of the IGM that would be provided by the observed high redshift galaxy population, and find that for most models, these galaxies are sufficient to bring the IGM temperature above our lower limits. However, there are significant ranges of parameter space that could produce a signal ruled out by the PAPER measurements; models with a steep drop-off in the star formation rate density at high redshifts or with relatively low values for the X-ray to star formation rate efficiency of high redshift galaxies are generally disfavored. The PAPER measurements are consistent with (but do not constrain) a hydrogen spin temperature above the CMB temperature, a situation which we find to be generally predicted if galaxies fainter than the current detection limits of optical/NIR surveys are included in calculations of X-ray heating., The highly redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen has become recognized as a unique probe of cosmology from relatively low redshifts (z ∼ 1) up through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) (z ∼ 8) and even beyond. To date, most work has focused on recovering the spherically averaged power spectrum of the 21-cm signal, since this approach maximizes the signal to noise in the initial measurement. However, like galaxy surveys, the 21-cm signal is affected by redshift space distortions, and is inherently anisotropic between the line of sight and transverse directions. A measurement of this anisotropy can yield unique cosmological information, potentially even isolating the matter power spectrum from astrophysical effects. However, in interferometric measurements, foregrounds also have an anisotropic footprint between the line of sight and transverse directions: the so-called foreground `wedge'. Although foreground subtraction techniques are actively being developed, a `foreground avoidance' approach of simply ignoring contaminated modes has arguably proven most successful to date. In this work, we analyse the effect of this foreground anisotropy in recovering the redshift space distortion signature in 21-cm measurements at both high and intermediate redshifts. We find the foreground wedge corrupts nearly all of the redshift space signal for even the largest proposed EoR experiments (Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array), making cosmological information unrecoverable without foreground subtraction. The situation is somewhat improved at lower redshifts, where the redshift-dependent mapping from observed coordinates to cosmological coordinates significantly reduces the size of the wedge. Using only foreground avoidance, we find that a large experiment like Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment can place non-trivial constraints on cosmological parameters., Using a simulation-based framework, we interpret the power spectrum measurements from PAPER of Ali et al. in the context of IGM physics at z = 7.7. A cold IGM will result in strong 21 cm absorption relative to the CMB and leads to a 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum that can exceed 3000 mK^2. The new PAPER measurements allow us to rule out extreme cold IGM models, placing a lower limit on the physical temperature of the IGM. We also compare this limit with a calculation for the predicted heating from the currently observed galaxy population at z = 8., , A number of experiments are currently working toward a measurement of the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whether or not these experiments deliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will prevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of reionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be enabled by the next generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the type of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple models for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history. We focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the ~0.1 km<SUP>2</SUP> collecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array concept design and parameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by considering different limits to the recently described ""wedge"" footprint in k space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a series of simulations that vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial temperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean free path of ionizing photons through the intergalactic medium. Given various combinations of models, we consider the significance of the possible power spectrum detections, the ability to trace the power spectrum evolution versus redshift, the detectability of salient power spectrum features, and the achievable level of quantitative constraints on astrophysical parameters. Ultimately, we find that 0.1 km<SUP>2</SUP> of collecting area is enough to ensure a very high significance (gsim 30σ) detection of the reionization power spectrum in even the most pessimistic scenarios. This sensitivity should allow for meaningful constraints on the reionization history and astrophysical parameters, especially if foreground subtraction techniques can be improved and successfully implemented., We present new observations with the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization with the aim of measuring the properties of foreground emission for 21 cm epoch of reionization (EoR) experiments at 150 MHz. We focus on the footprint of the foregrounds in cosmological Fourier space to understand which modes of the 21 cm power spectrum will most likely be compromised by foreground emission. These observations confirm predictions that foregrounds can be isolated to a ""wedge""-like region of two-dimensional (k <SUB></SUB>, k <SUB>∥</SUB>)-space, creating a window for cosmological studies at higher k <SUB>∥</SUB> values. We also find that the emission extends past the nominal edge of this wedge due to spectral structure in the foregrounds, with this feature most prominent on the shortest baselines. Finally, we filter the data to retain only this ""unsmooth"" emission and image its specific k <SUB>∥</SUB> modes. The resultant images show an excess of power at the lowest modes, but no emission can be clearly localized to any one region of the sky. This image is highly suggestive that the most problematic foregrounds for 21 cm EoR studies will not be easily identifiable bright sources, but rather an aggregate of fainter emission., This work describes a new instrument optimized for a detection of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm power spectrum between redshifts of 0.5 and 1.5: the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) array. BAOBAB will build on the efforts of a first generation of 21 cm experiments that are targeting a detection of the signal from the Epoch of Reionization at z ~ 10. At z ~ 1, the emission from neutral hydrogen in self-shielded overdense halos also presents an accessible signal, since the dominant, synchrotron foreground emission is considerably fainter than at redshift 10. The principle science driver for these observations are baryon acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum which have the potential to act as a standard ruler and constrain the nature of dark energy. BAOBAB will fully correlate dual-polarization antenna tiles over the 600-900 MHz band with a frequency resolution of 300 kHz and a system temperature of 50 K. The number of antennas will grow in staged deployments, and reconfigurations of the array will allow for both traditional imaging and high power spectrum sensitivity operations. We present calculations of the power spectrum sensitivity for various array sizes, with a 35 element array measuring the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction as a function of redshift, and a 132 element system detecting the BAO features in the power spectrum, yielding a 1.8% error on the z ~ 1 distance scale, and, in turn, significant improvements to constraints on the dark energy equation of state over an unprecedented range of redshifts from ~0.5 to 1.5., The highly-redshifted 21cm line of neutral hydrogen is one of the most promising and unique probes of cosmology for the next decade and beyond. The past few years have seen a number of dedicated experiments targeting the 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) begin operation, including the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER). For these experiments to yield cosmological results, they require new calibration and analysis algorithms which will need to achieve unprecedented levels of separation between the 21cm signal and contaminating foreground emission. Although much work has been spent developing these algorithms over the past decade, their success or failure will ultimately depend on their ability to overcome the complications associated with real-world systems and their inherent complications. The work in this dissertation is closely tied to the late-stage commissioning and early observations with PAPER. The first two chapters focus on developing calibration algorithms to overcome unique problems arising in the PAPER system. To test these algorithms, I rely on not only simulations, but on commissioning observations, ultimately tying the success of the algorithm to its performance on actual, celestial data. The first algorithm works to correct gain-drifts in the PAPER system caused by the heating and cooling of various components (the amplifiers and above ground co-axial cables, in particular). It is shown that a simple measurement of the ambient temperature can remove ∼ 10% gain fluctuations in the observed brightness of calibrator sources. This result is highly encouraging for the ability of PAPER to remove a potentially dominant systematic in its power spectrum and cataloging measurements without resorting to a complicated system overhaul. The second new algorithm developed in this dissertation solves a major calibration challenge not just for PAPER, but for nearly all of a large class of new wide-field, drift- scanning radio telescopes: primary beam calibration in the presence of a poorly measured sky. Since these telescopes lack the ability to steer their primary beams, while seeing nearly the entire sky at once, a large number of calibrator sources are necessary to probe the entire beam response. However, the catalogs of radio sources at low-frequencies are not reliable enough to achieve the level of primary beam accuraccy needed for 21cm cosmology experiments. I develop, test, and apply a new technique which -- using only the assumption of symmetry around a 180° rotation -- simultaneously solves for the primary beam and the flux density of large number of sources. In this dissertation, I also present the analysis of new observations from PAPER to test theoretical models which predict foreground emission is confined to a ""wedge""-like region of cosmological Fourier space, leaving an ""EoR window"" free from contamination. For the first time in actual observations, these predictions are spectacularly confirmed. In many ways, this result shifts the burden for upcoming PAPER analysis from foreground removal to increased sensitivity. And although increasing sensitivity is no small feat in-and-of-itself, this result is highly encouraging for 21cm studies, as foreground removal was long-viewed as the principal challenge for this field. The final result in this dissertation is the application of the all the lessons learned building PAPER and the MWA to design a new experiment for 21cm studies at z ∼ 1 with the goal of measuring baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The design of the BAO Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) Array is described, and cosmological forecasts are presented. The bottom line is highly encouraging, suggesting that z ∼ 1 21cm observations can detect the neutral hydrogen power spectrum with a very modest (16 - 32 element) array, and that still reasonably sized (128 - 256 elements) arrays can produce significant advances in our knowledge of dark energy., In this talk I will present BAOBAB: a new instrument designed for observations of the 21cm cosmic neutral hydrogen signal between redshifts of 0.5-1.5. Following in the footsteps of 21cm experiments PAPER and the MWA, BAOBAB will grow in staged deployments, first targeting a measurement of the neutral hydrogen power spectrum to constrain the redshift evolution of the cosmic neutral hydrogen fraction and the bias of DLAs. I will present predictions for future BAOBAB deployments, and show that a moderate-sized ~128-element array can yield a high-significance detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation features and considerably improve constraints on the equation of state and time evolution of dark energy., The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) is an experiment to detect the heating and reionization of the IGM through the highly redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen. This talk will describe our current deployments in Green Bank, West Virginia and the South African Karoo. I will present recent simulations and new observational data which illustrate our “delay spectrum” approach to foreground isolation and power spectrum detection. To conclude, I will present a proposed Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Broadband and Broad-beam (BAOBAB) array, which will use the delay spectrum technique at frequencies of 600-900 MHz to detect the power spectrum of neutral hydrogen in the post-reionization epoch., We present a new technique for calibrating the primary beam of a wide-field, drift-scanning antenna element. Drift-scan observing is not compatible with standard beam calibration routines, and the situation is further complicated by difficult-to-parameterize beam shapes and, at low frequencies, the sparsity of accurate source spectra to use as calibrators. We overcome these challenges by building up an interrelated network of source ""crossing points""—locations where the primary beam is sampled by multiple sources. Using the single assumption that a beam has 180° rotational symmetry, we can achieve significant beam coverage with only a few tens of sources. The resulting network of crossing points allows us to solve for both a beam model and source flux densities referenced to a single calibrator source, circumventing the need for a large sample of well-characterized calibrators. We illustrate the method with actual and simulated observations from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization., The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) is an experiment to detect the heating and reionization of the IGM through the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen. Due to cosmological redshifting, the emission from this epoch will be located in a band around 150 MHz. This poster will present our calibration work and recent observations of the low-frequency sky from our two 32 elemen","['2023AAS...24110425P', '2021apra.prop....7P', '2019AAS...23430801P', '2019AAS...23341306P', '2018AAS...23231204P', '2018IAUS..333...87P', '10.1017/S1743921317011243', '2018AAS...23143002P', '2017AAS...22912504P', '10.48550/arXiv.1608.01324', '2016arXiv160801324P', 'arXiv:1608.01324', '10.1093/mnrasl/slw156', '2016MNRAS.463L..56P', 'ascl:1609.013', '2016ascl.soft09013P', '10.48550/arXiv.1601.06177', '2016ApJ...819....8P', '10.3847/0004-637X/819/1/8', '2016arXiv160106177P', 'arXiv:1601.06177', '2016apra.prop...80P', '10.48550/arXiv.1503.00045', 'arXiv:1503.00045', '2015arXiv150300045P', '2015ApJ...809...62P', '10.1088/0004-637X/809/1/62', '10.1093/mnras/stu2575', '2015MNRAS.447.1705P', 'arXiv:1411.2050', '2014arXiv1411.2050P', '10.48550/arXiv.1411.2050', '2015AAS...22530103P', '2014ApJ...788...96P', '10.1088/0004-637X/788/1/96', '10.1088/0004-637X/782/2/66', '2013arXiv1310.7031P', '2014ApJ...782...66P', '10.48550/arXiv.1310.7031', 'arXiv:1310.7031', '2013ApJ...768L..36P', '10.48550/arXiv.1301.7099', '10.1088/2041-8205/768/2/L36', 'arXiv:1301.7099', '2013arXiv1301.7099P', '10.1088/0004-6256/145/3/65', '2012arXiv1210.2413P', '10.48550/arXiv.1210.2413', '2013AJ....145...65P', 'arXiv:1210.2413', '2013PhDT.......168P', '2013AAS...22122201P', '2012AAS...22010402P', 'arXiv:1111.2882', '10.1088/0004-6256/143/2/53', '10.48550/arXiv.1111.2882', '2012AJ....143...53P', '2011arXiv1111.2882P', '2011AAS...21743206P', '2011BAAS...4343206P']","[('cm', 60), ('foreground', 47), ('experiment', 42), ('reionization', 38), ('hydrogen', 36), ('redshift', 36), ('array', 35), ('spectrum', 35), ('power', 34), ('signal', 33)]","[(('power', 'spectrum'), 30), (('epoch', 'reionization'), 28), (('neutral', 'hydrogen'), 24), (('foreground', 'emission'), 13), (('cm', 'signal'), 12), (('cm', 'cosmology'), 11), (('high', 'redshift'), 10), (('precision', 'array'), 10), (('array', 'probing'), 10), (('probing', 'epoch'), 10)]","[(('precision', 'array', 'probing'), 10), (('array', 'probing', 'epoch'), 10), (('probing', 'epoch', 'reionization'), 10), (('line', 'neutral', 'hydrogen'), 9), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'paper'), 8), (('highly', 'redshifted', 'cm'), 7), (('hydrogen', 'epoch', 'reionization'), 7), (('epoch', 'reionization', 'array'), 7), (('cm', 'line', 'neutral'), 6), (('neutral', 'hydrogen', 'cosmology'), 6)]",Dirty

Box 3818, Charlottesville, VA 22903-0818","We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise ALMA observations. CO(5-4) and continuum emission (850 μm) at a spatial resolution of 0.″3 reveal two compact (r <SUB>1/2</SUB> ∼ 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc, indicative of an early stage in a merger. With an SFR of 991 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, this starburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as is usually seen in hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the dynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1-0) luminosity ({α }<SUB>CO</SUB>}\equiv {M}<SUB>gas</SUB>}/{L}<SUB>CO</SUB> 1-0}<SUP>{\prime</SUP> }), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation triggered in both galaxies is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high gas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (τ <SUB>depl</SUB> = 85 and 67 Myr) to convert gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates the power of ALMA to study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift., We present an analysis of the molecular gas properties, based on CO (2-1) emission, of 12 starburst galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 selected by having a boost (≳4×) in their star formation rate (SFR) above the average star-forming galaxy at an equivalent stellar mass. ALMA observations are acquired of six more galaxies than previously reported through our effort. As a result of the larger statistical sample, we significantly detect, for the first time at high z, a systematically lower {L}<SUB>CO</SUB>}<SUP>{\prime</SUP> }/L <SUB>IR</SUB> ratio in galaxies lying above the star-forming “main sequence” (MS). Based on an estimate of α <SUB>CO</SUB> (i.e., the ratio of molecular gas mass to {L}<SUB>CO</SUB> 1-0}<SUP>{\prime</SUP> }), we convert the observational quantities (e.g., {L}<SUB>CO</SUB>}<SUP>{\prime</SUP> }/L <SUB>IR</SUB>) to physical units (M <SUB>gas</SUB>/SFR) that represent the gas depletion time or its inverse, the star formation efficiency. We interpret the results as indicative of the star formation efficiency increasing in a continuous fashion from the MS to the starburst regime, whereas the gas fractions remain comparable to those of MS galaxies. However, the balance between an increase in star formation efficiency and gas fraction depends on the adopted value of α <SUB>CO</SUB> as discussed., Herein we analyse late-time (post-plateau; 103 &lt; t &lt; 1229 d) optical spectra of low-redshift (z &lt; 0.016), hydrogen-rich Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP). Our newly constructed sample contains 91 nebular spectra of 38 SNe IIP, which is the largest data set of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the objects have complementary photometric data. The strongest and most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral features (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper late-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises from less efficient trapping of γ-rays and positrons, which could be caused by multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of the explosion itself. Furthermore, if γ-rays and positrons can escape more easily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more luminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger progenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that is well-mixed with the hydrogen layer. In addition, we find a subset of objects with evidence for asymmetric <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejection, likely bipolar in shape. We also compare our observations to theoretical late-time spectral models of SNe IIP from two separate groups and find moderate-to-good agreement with both sets of models. Our SNe IIP spectra are consistent with models of 12-15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> progenitor stars having relatively low metallicity (Z ≤ 0.01)., Type II-Plateau supernovae (SNe IIP) are H-rich explosions that come from red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. Despite the fact that they are the most common subtype of SN, little work has been done on late-time observations of SNe IIP owing to their relative faintness at these epochs. We analyze 91 late-time (older than about 100 days past explosion) optical spectra of 38 SNe IIP, making this the largest sample of SN IIP nebular spectra ever studied. Quantitative criteria from the spectra themselves are employed to determine if an observation is truly nebular, and thus should be included in the study. We measure the fluxes, shapes, and velocities of various emission lines and investigate their temporal evolution. These values are also compared to photometric data in order to search for correlations that may allow us to gain insight into the RSG progenitors of SNe IIP and learn more about the details of the explosion itself., The majority of the SN Ia spectra used in this study come from the Berkeley SN Ia Program (BSNIP) and have been published in BSNIP I (Silverman et al., 2012, Cat. J/MNRAS/425/1789). Most of these data were obtained with the Shane 3 m telescope at Lick Observatory using the Kast double spectrograph. The typical wavelength coverage of 3300-10400Å (with resolutions of ~11 and ~6Å on the red and blue sides, respectively) allows us to observe the CaHK and CaIR3 features simultaneously. All objects have z&lt;0.1 with a median redshift of 0.02. <P />(4 data files)., A rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) shows evidence of strong interaction with a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM); these objects are referred to as SNe Ia-CSM. PTF11kx began life as a SN Ia, but after a month it began to show indications of significant interaction with its CSM. This well-studied object solidified the connection between SNe Ia-CSM and more typical SNe Ia, despite their spectral similarity to Type IIn SNe (which likely come from massive star progenitors, as opposed to the white dwarf progenitors for the SNe Ia-CSM). The spectra of all ~20 known SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by Hα emission (with widths of ~2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and exhibit large Hα/Hβ intensity ratios; moreover, they have an almost complete lack of He I emission (see left panel of Figure 1). They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of Hα 75-100 days past maximum brightness. The absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 mag &lt;= M <SUB> R </SUB> &lt;= -19 mag (see right panel of Figure 1), and they also show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM imply that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population., We are analysing late-time (older than about 150 d past explosion) optical spectra of Type II-Plateau (IIP) supernovae (SNe), which are H-rich SNe that come from red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. The dataset includes nearly 100 spectra of about 40 objects, making this the largest sample of SN IIP nebular spectra ever investigated. Quantitative criteria from within the spectra themselves are employed to determine if an observation is truly nebular, and thus should be included in the study. We present the temporal evolution of the fluxes, shapes, and velocities of various emission lines (see, for example, Fig. 1). These measured values are also compared to photometric data in order to search for correlations that can allow us to gain insight into the diversity of RSG progenitors and learn more about the details of the explosion itself., We report on observations carried out between 2012 March and 2013 January with Subaru/FMOS. The central square degree of COSMOS is effectively covered with four FMOS footprints, designated as HR1-HR4 (Figure 1), using both the high-resolution H-long (1.60-1.80um; R~2600) and J-long (1.11-1.35um) gratings. <P />(1 data file)., Local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars, as compared to typical star-forming galaxies at a given stellar mass, possibly indicative of different modes of star formation. With the peak epoch of galaxy formation occurring at z &gt; 1, it remains to be established whether such an efficient mode of star formation is occurring at high redshift. To address this issue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ∼ 1.6) starburst galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and IRAM/Plateau de Bure Interferometer. Our targets are selected from the sample of Herschel far-infrared-detected galaxies having star formation rates (∼300-800 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) elevated (≳4×) above the star-forming main sequence (MS) and included in the FMOS-COSMOS near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 with Subaru. We detect CO emission in all cases at high levels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (∼30%-50%). Even more compelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection that starbursts, identified as MS outliers, at high redshift generally have a lower ratio of CO to total infrared luminosity as compared to typical MS star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset than expected based on past studies of local starbursts. We put forward a hypothesis that there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency with elevation from the MS with galaxy mergers as a possible physical driver. Along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshift sample is similar in other respects to local starbursts, such as being metal rich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium., We present a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the COSMOS field using the Fiber Multi-object Spectrograph (FMOS), a near-infrared instrument on the Subaru Telescope. Our survey is specifically designed to detect the Hα emission line that falls within the H-band (1.6-1.8 μm) spectroscopic window from star-forming galaxies with 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 and M<SUB>stellar</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. With the high multiplex capability of FMOS, it is now feasible to construct samples of over 1000 galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts at epochs that were previously challenging. The high-resolution mode (R ∼ 2600) effectively separates Hα and [N ii]λ6585, thus enabling studies of the gas-phase metallicity and photoionization state of the interstellar medium. The primary aim of our program is to establish how star formation depends on stellar mass and environment, both recognized as drivers of galaxy evolution at lower redshifts. In addition to the main galaxy sample, our target selection places priority on those detected in the far-infrared by Herschel/PACS to assess the level of obscured star formation and investigate, in detail, outliers from the star formation rate (SFR)—stellar mass relation. Galaxies with Hα detections are followed up with FMOS observations at shorter wavelengths using the J-long (1.11-1.35 μm) grating to detect Hβ and [O iii]λ5008 which provides an assessment of the extinction required to measure SFRs not hampered by dust, and an indication of embedded active galactic nuclei. With 460 redshifts measured from 1153 spectra, we assess the performance of the instrument with respect to achieving our goals, discuss inherent biases in the sample, and detail the emission-line properties. Our higher-level data products, including catalogs and spectra, are available to the community., We analyse late-time (older than about 150 days past explosion) optical spectra of Type II-Plateau (IIP) supernovae (SNe), which are H-rich SNe that come from red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. The dataset includes over 100 spectra of about 50 objects, making this the largest sample of SN IIP nebular spectra ever investigated. Quantitative criteria from within the spectra themselves are employed to determine if an observation is truly nebular, and thus should be included in the study. We present the temporal evolution of the fluxes, shapes, and velocities of various emission lines. These measured values are also compared to photometric data in order to search for correlations that can allow us to gain insight into the diversity of RSG progenitors and learn more about the details of the explosion itself., Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia shows evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; these objects are referred to as SNe Ia-CSM. PTF11kx began life as a SN Ia, but after a month it began to show indications of significant interaction with its CSM. This well-studied object was revolutionary in that in solidified the connection between SNe Ia-CSM and more typical SNe Ia, despite their spectral similarity to Type IIn SNe (which likely come from massive star progenitors, as opposed to the white dwarf progenitors for the SNe Ia-CSM). There are currently nearly 20 SNe Ia-CSM with published data. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by Hα emission (with widths of ~2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and exhibit large Hα/Hβ intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost complete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of Hα 75-100 days past maximum brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 mag ≤ M<SUB>R</SUB> ≤ -19 mag, and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population., `High-velocity features' (HVFs) are spectral features in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that have minima indicating significantly higher (by greater than about 6000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) velocities than typical `photospheric-velocity features' (PVFs). The PVFs are absorption features with minima indicating typical photospheric (i.e. bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ∼9000-15 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> near B-band maximum brightness). In this work, we undertake the most in-depth study of HVFs ever performed. The data set used herein consists of 445 low-resolution optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximum brightness) of 210 low-redshift SNe Ia that follow the `Phillips relation'. A series of Gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterize possible HVFs of Ca II H&amp;K, Si II λ6355, and the Ca II NIR triplet. The temporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the PVFs and HVFs of these three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlations with other SN Ia observables. We find that while HVFs of Ca II are regularly observed (except in underluminous SNe Ia, where they are never found), HVFs of Si II λ6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at the earliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. It is also shown that stronger HVFs of Si II λ6355 are found in objects that lack C II absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/optical colours near maximum brightness. These results lead to a self-consistent connection between the presence and strength of HVFs of Si II λ6355 and many other mutually correlated SN Ia observables, including photospheric velocity., Spectra of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained before maximum brightness sometimes show high-velocity features (HVFs). They are most often seen in Si II and Ca II and in the most obvious cases appear as a second, separate absorption feature at ~7000-10000 km/s higher expansion velocity than the more normal photospheric-velocity features (PVFs). We have investigated how often HVFs occur, at what epochs, and how they evolve with time using a large sample of low-resolution, optical and NIR spectra of nearby SNe Ia. Our ongoing study indicates that HVFs are quite common in SNe Ia spectra obtained prior to 5 days before maximum brightness. Correlations between photometric observables and the relative line strengths and expansion velocities of both HVFs and PVFs are currently being sought and some intriguing results have already been found and will be discussed. Various explanations for the existence and behavior of the HVFs are being considered, with possibilities including density enhancements in the outer portion of the SN ejecta and low levels of interaction with circumstellar material., Measurements of community calcification (G<SUB>net</SUB>) were made during September 2008 and October 2009 on a reef flat in Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, 33 years after the first measurements were made there by the LIMER expedition in 1975. In 2008 and 2009 we measured G<SUB>net</SUB> = 61 ± 12 and 54 ± 13 mmol CaCO<SUB>3</SUB> m<SUP>-2</SUP>·day<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. These rates are 27-49% lower than those measured during the same season in 1975-76. These rates agree well with those estimated from the measured temperature and degree of aragonite saturation using a reef calcification rate equation developed from observations in a Red Sea coral reef. Community structure surveys across the Lizard Island reef flat during our study using the same methods employed in 1978 showed that live coral coverage had not changed significantly (∼8%). However, it should be noted that the uncertainty in the live coral coverage estimates in this study and in 1978 were fairly large and inherent to this methodology. Using the reef calcification rate equation while assuming that seawater above the reef was at equilibrium with atmospheric PCO<SUB>2</SUB> and given that live coral cover had not changed G<SUB>net</SUB> should have declined by 30 ± 8% since the LIMER study as indeed observed. We note, however, that the error in estimated G<SUB>net</SUB> decrease relative to the 1970's could be much larger due to the uncertainties in the coral coverage measurements. Nonetheless, the similarity between the predicted and the measured decrease in G<SUB>net</SUB> suggests that ocean acidification may be the primary cause for the lower CaCO<SUB>3</SUB> precipitation rate on the Lizard Island reef flat., Optical spectra of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained before maximum brightness sometimes show high-velocity features (HVFs). They are most often seen in Si II and Ca II and in the most obvious cases appear as a second, separate absorption feature at ~7000-10000 km/s higher expansion velocity than the more normal photospheric velocity features (PVFs). We explore how to determine the presence or absence of HVFs and how to accurately measure these two components. We investigate how often HVFs occur, at what epochs, and how they evolve with time using a large sample of low-resolution, optical spectra of nearby SNe Ia. Our ongoing study indicates that HVFs are quite common in SNe Ia during the weeks leading up to maximum brightness. Correlations between photometric observables and the strengths and expansion velocities of both HVFs and PVFs are currently being sought. Various explanations for the existence and behavior of the HVFs are being considered, with possibilities including a density enhancement in the outer portion of the SN ejecta or low levels of interaction with circumstellar material., We describe X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton of 18 M <SUB>group</SUB> ~ 1-6 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, z ~ 0.05 galaxy groups from the Zurich ENvironmental Study. The X-ray data aim at establishing the frequency and properties, unaffected by host galaxy dilution and obscuration, of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in central and satellite galaxies, also as a function of halo-centric distance. X-ray point-source detections are reported for 22 of the 177 galaxies, down to a sensitivity level of f <SUB>0.5 - 8 keV</SUB> ~ 5 × 10<SUP>-15</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, corresponding to a limiting luminosity of L <SUB>0.5 - 8 keV</SUB> ~ 3 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. With the majority of the X-ray sources attributed to AGNs of low-to-moderate levels (L/L <SUB>Edd</SUB> &gt;~ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>), we discuss the detection rate in the context of the occupation of AGNs to halos of this mass scale and redshift and compare the structural and morphological properties between AGN-active and non-active galaxies. At galaxy mass scales &lt;10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, central galaxies appear to be a factor of ~4 more likely to host AGNs than satellite galaxies of similar mass. This effect, coupled with the tendency for AGNs to be hosted by massive galaxies, explains the (weak) trend for AGNs to be preferentially found in the inner parts of group halos, with no detectable trend with halo-centric distance in the frequency of AGNs within the satellite population. Finally, our data indicate that the rate of decline with redshift of AGN activity in galaxy groups matches that of the global AGN population, indicating that either AGN activity occurs preferentially in group halos or that the evolution rate is independent of halo mass., The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2000cx was one of the most peculiar transients ever discovered, with a rise to maximum brightness typical of a SN Ia, but a slower decline and a higher photospheric temperature. 13 yr later SN 2013bh (also known as iPTF13abc), a near identical twin, was discovered and we obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and low-resolution optical spectroscopy from discovery until about 1 month past r-band maximum brightness. The spectra of both objects show iron-group elements [Co II, Ni II, Fe II, Fe III and high-velocity features (HVFs) of Ti II], intermediate-mass elements (Si II, Si III and S II) and separate normal velocity features (∼12 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and HVFs (∼24 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) of Ca II. Persistent absorption from Fe III and Si III, along with the colour evolution, implies high blackbody temperatures for SNe 2013bh and 2000cx (∼12 000 K). Both objects lack narrow Na I D absorption and exploded in the outskirts of their hosts, indicating that the SN environments were relatively free of interstellar or circumstellar material and may imply that the progenitors came from a relatively old and low-metallicity stellar population. Models of SN 2000cx, seemingly applicable to SN 2013bh, imply the production of up to ∼1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni and (4.3-5.5) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of fast-moving Ca ejecta., In this paper, we present the low-redshift SN Ia spectral data set. This sample consists of a total of 1298 spectra of 582 SNe Ia observed from 1989 to the end of 2008. <P />(5 data files)., In this second paper in a series, we present measurements of spectral features of 432 low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) optical spectra of 261 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 20d of maximum brightness. The data were obtained from 1989 to the end of 2008 as part of the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) and are presented in BSNIP I by Silverman et al. (J/MNRAS/425/1789). We describe in detail our method of automated, robust spectral feature definition and measurement which expands upon similar previous studies. Using this procedure, we attempt to measure expansion velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs), spectral feature depths and fluxes at the centre and endpoints of each of nine major spectral feature complexes. <P />(10 data files)., PTF11kx was a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) that showed time-variable absorption features, including saturated Ca II H and K lines that weakened and eventually went into emission. The strength of the emission component of Hα gradually increased, implying that the SN was undergoing significant interaction with its circumstellar medium (CSM). These features, and many others, were blueshifted slightly and showed a P-Cygni profile, likely indicating that the CSM was directly related to, and probably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. These and other observations led Dilday et al. to conclude that PTF11kx came from a symbiotic nova progenitor like RS Oph. In this work we extend the spectral coverage of PTF11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. The late-time spectra of PTF11kx are dominated by Hα emission (with widths of full width at half-maximum intensity ≈2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), strong Ca II emission features (~10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> wide), and a blue ""quasi-continuum"" due to many overlapping narrow lines of Fe II. Emission from oxygen, He I, and Balmer lines higher than Hα is weak or completely absent at all epochs, leading to large observed Hα/Hβ intensity ratios. The Hα emission appears to increase in strength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly along with the Ca II emission. Our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility of newly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the red wing of Hα. During the same epochs, multiple narrow emission features from the CSM temporally vary in strength. The weakening of the Hα and Ca II emission at late times is possible evidence that the SN ejecta have overtaken the majority of the CSM and agrees with models of other strongly interacting SNe Ia. The varying narrow emission features, on the other hand, may indicate that the CSM is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells., Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia shows evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the first systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and here we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been well studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in depth for the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by Hα emission (with widths of ~2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and exhibit large Hα/Hβ intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost complete lack of He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of Hα 75-100 days past maximum brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 mag &lt;= M<SUB>R</SUB> &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects come from a relatively young stellar population. This work represents the most detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM class to date., We write that a spectrogram, obtained on Mar. 31.18 UT with the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (+ Marcario Low-Resolution Spectrograph) by J. Caldwell, shows that MASTER OT J122114.34+472950.7 is a type-Ia supernova. Correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""SuperNova IDentification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J. 666, 1024) indicates that MASTER OT J122114.34+472950.7 is SN 1999aa-like type-Ia supernova (Strolger, et al., 2002, A.J., 124, 2905; Garavini, et al., 2004, A.J., 128, 387) at maximum brightness., In this work, we analyse late-time (t &gt; 100 d) optical spectra of low-redshift (z &lt; 0.1) Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) which come mostly from the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP) data set. We also present spectra of SN 2011 by for the first time. The BSNIP sample studied consists of 34 SNe Ia with 60 nebular spectra, to which we add nebular spectral feature measurements of 20 SNe Ia from previously published work (Maeda et al. and Blondin et al.), representing the largest set of late-time SN Ia spectra ever analysed. The full width at half-maximum intensity and velocities of the [Fe III] λ4701, [Fe II] λ7155 and [Ni II] λ7378 emission features are measured in most observations of spectroscopically normal objects where the data have signal-to-noise ratios ≳ 20 pixel<SUP>-1</SUP> and are older than 160 d past maximum brightness. The velocities of all three features are seen to be relatively constant with time, increasing only a few to ∼20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. The nebular velocity (v<SUB>neb</SUB>, calculated by taking the average of the [Fe II] λ7155 and [Ni II] λ7378 velocities) is correlated with the near-maximum-brightness velocity gradient and early-time ejecta velocity. Nearly all high velocity gradient objects have redshifted nebular lines while most low velocity gradient objects have blueshifted nebular lines. No correlation is found between v<SUB>neb</SUB> and Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B), and for a given light-curve shape there is a large range of observed nebular velocities. The data also indicate a correlation between observed (B - V)<SUB>max</SUB> and v<SUB>neb</SUB>., J. M. Silverman, University of Texas; J. Vinko, University of Szeged; R. Quimby, Kavli IPMU, University of Tokyo; and J. C. Wheeler and E. Chatzopoulos, University of Texas, write that a spectrogram, obtained on Mar. 1.14 UT with the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (+ Marcario Low-Resolution Spectrograph) by S. Rostopchin, shows that PSN J09443380+5545444 = SN 2013ah (cf. CBET 3430) is a type-Ia supernova. Correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""SuperNova IDentification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J. 666, 1024) indicates that PSN J09443380+5545444 = SN 2013ah is a normal type-Ia supernova at maximum brightness. After removal of the host-galaxy recession velocity of 7362 km/s (from narrow emission lines), the absorption minimum of the Si II 635.5-nm line is found to be blueshifted by about 11300 km/s., We report that inspection of a spectrogram, obtained on Feb. 22.38 UT with the 9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (+ Marcario Low-Resolution Spectrograph) by S. Odewahn, shows that SN 2013ab (CBET 3422) has likely evolved into a type-IIP supernova., PTF11kx was a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with indications of significant interaction with its circumstellar medium (CSM). We extend the spectral coverage of PTF11kx to 124-436 d past maximum brightness. We also discuss the SN Ia-csm subclass (i.e., SNe Ia that are strongly interacting with CSM) as a whole, which now consists of up to 15 members (including PTF11kx), and we present new spectra of many of them. Four SNe Ia-csm have been well-studied previously, four were previously known but are analyzed in depth for the first time here, and six are new discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). The spectra of all SNe Ia-csm are dominated by H-alpha emission and show an almost complete lack of He I emission in addition to large Balmer decrements (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells). They also exhibit evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing of the H-alpha emission 75-100 days past maximum brightness, and half of the SNe Ia-csm show strong Na I D absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for extinction) of SN Ia-csm objects are found to be -21 ≤ M_R ≤ -19 mag, and they also see","['10.48550/arXiv.1810.01595', '10.3847/1538-4357/aae64b',
